2017-11-09,thelittlesongbird,This is a television show?,10,"was over,time on a gradual binge of watching 'game of thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and imdb reviewers. plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? the good news is that 'game of thrones' didn't go wrong. quite the opposite. not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. a television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. this is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.visually, 'game of thrones' looks amazing. the scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. as well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.one cannot talk about 'game of thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.it is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. it always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. the story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. they're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'game of thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. these characters are not hero and villain archetypes (joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'game of thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. even those who are not favourites of mine. big acting standouts are peter dinklage, sean bean, lena headey and jack gleeson (joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).in conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. this review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'game of thrones' is that good. 10/10 bethany cox"
2012-04-27,leofwine_draca,TV par excellence,10,"season onean outstanding television drama that helps set a new benchmark in terms of quality. the complex storyline involves the battle for supremacy between various political factions who dominate a worldscape that's as involved and complex as anything tolkien could muster up. each episode is riven with treachery, backstabbing, allegiances, betrayals, friendships and battle.there are 10 episodes in this first season and every one's a stunner, perfectly paced with a mix of exposition and action. the scripts are intelligent and insightful; each writer knows that it's the characters who make or break a show, and every single one of them is interesting and engaging. despite the huge cast, it's easy to become familiar with the main players. it's hard to single out any actor for praise: sean bean, lena headey, mark addy, maisie williams, emilia clarke, aiden gillen, iain glen; none of them put a foot wrong, they each inhabit their role with so much depth that you forget about the actor and focus on the character instead. peter dinklage is perhaps the luckiest, capturing a truly scene,stealing character with wit and warmth.season twoit's impossible to say too much about the many twists, surprises and genuine shocks in the show without spoiling it, but overall game of thrones remains a realistic, harrowing and exceptionally involving piece of television. a complex tableau of characters is woven and yet despite the complexity of geography, politics, allegiances and history, the viewer is never left confused, not even for a second. season 2 ups the ante with even more explicit sex and a key climactic battle sequence that wouldn't be out of place in the likes of lord of the rings. despite these cinematic elements, however, the focus remains on intricate characterisation and that's what holds this show together, no matter how many truly fantastic elements are thrown into the mix.season threeseason 3 offers more of the same, with some particularly vicious torture sequences and lots more twists and turns as the plot develops. and while it's hard to pick out a season that's superior to the others, i can safely say that, when it comes, the red wedding is undoubtedly the highlight of the show so far; a stunning, unforgettable set-piece that never lets you go. strong stuff indeed, just as i'd expect from what is the best thing on television at the moment.season fourthings remain on a high-quality level with season 4 of the show, which i think is an improvement on the previous season (as good as it was). there's no long-winded journey here with characters meeting their inevitable fate in episode 9 as there was in season 3; instead it all feels fresh and inventive, and all of the major story lines are packed with peril and incident. neil marshall's epic battle in episode 9 is the highlight, but peter dinklage contributes some excellent acting and rory mccann has never been better as the hound. by all accounts this is the last season to stick closely to the plot of the martin novels, so i can't wait to see where season 5 goes.season fiveseason 5 sees the show no longer at the top of its game but it still packs a wallop as a prime piece of tv and it nevertheless knocks spots off the competition. i'd probably give this a 9/10 purely because some of the scripted lines are weak, there's a greater reliance on extraneous sex and nudity than in the previous couple of seasons, and some of the characters could have been written better. it's nonetheless as rousing as ever, with some great twists, some truly shocking character deaths, and stunning production values. the first seven episodes build up to an electric trio at the climax, with the episode 'hardhome' containing the best set-piece of the entire series so far.season sixseason 6 picks up from the previous season to provide a better quality viewing experience all round. gone are most of the extraneous story lines, with only a handful of dumb humour scenes left in. things feel more vital here, more important than ever, and more dangerous. i particularly liked the way that the writers go out of their way to re-introduce old characters and tie up loose ends which they do very well. as before, things build to an incredible last couple of episodes, and as ever i'm left eagerly awaiting the next series.season seventhis penultimate season of the show is very much in end-game territory. there are only 7 episodes and they move incredibly fast, so that characters appear to be teleporting all over the world given the speed of their travel. there are less characters now so those that remain have to do more, while the spectacular, dragon-oriented action is better than ever before, with the stand-out episodes being four and six in that respect. the north-of-the-wall material is quite incredible, in fact, and harks back to the highs of hardhome. the rest is expensive, expansive, and thoroughly engaging, as ever.season eightas for the final season, well, it gets a lot of flak here on the internet...but i loved it. six short episodes, the first couple of which are strong in terms of scene setting. the third episode is the big siege, a little dark and death-free for my liking, but otherwise up there with other fantastic siege stories done right on screen such as the two towers. the fourth episode is the weakest with some excruciating moments, but the fifth might well be the best episode of all, filled with heightened drama and terrific on-screen destruction. the final episode is weaker and ends with some excruciating happy-ever-after material, but the criticisms i have aren't enough to detract from a more than satisfying end to the show."
2019-05-20,snoopystyle,watercooler,9,"in the fictional seven kingdoms of westeros, the ruler sits on the iron throne. it's a story of various characters fighting to gain the throne, influence the throne, or survive the throne. there are white walkers, giants, dragons, and a big ice wall.this follows the george r. r. martin series of fantasy novels, at least for the earlier seasons. this hbo show lasted 8 seasons, 6 of which are the pinnacle of prestige tv. in our fragmented tv world, this may be the last of the watercooler shows. people are eager to watch it on its first airing and eager to discuss it with their friends right away. people binge to catch up so they can join the conversation. the writing is great. the production is cinematic. no spoilers in this review. just binge and enjoy."
2018-01-06,hitchcoc,A Need Fulfilled,10,"i am writing this because according to the imdb user ratings, i have not commented. i have reviewed all the individual episodes, but not the show as a whole. there is little that i can add to the impact of this show. i am proud to be on the same planet as those who created and put this work into fruition. when one looks at the technical accomplishments and the multiple plot strains that have been kept in balance, it is truly a wonder. i know that there are those who can never get past the ""book did this"" and ""the book did that."" we have to come to realize that it is impossible to recreate every nuance that fiction allows and that occasionally characters must be dropped and events assumed. for me, i have approached these as the artistic creations they are,-as film (and television, at that). i have the books. i've not read them but plan to at some point. i doubt at this late stage of my life there will ever be another series to match this. i like fantasy but am not ruled by it as a genre. but this is for us all. if you've not seen it, treat yourself."
2019-04-14,kirpianuscus,I am not its fan...,9,"i am not one of its fans. for its childish stories, for the feeling after a season biging. but its virtues are many. and real. from performances of great actors to magnificent use of cgi. for the portraits and for something who you feel authentic and slice of near reality. for the tension and for high care to details. for music and for the mark of hbo. for the sides of cruelty and references to mythologies and medieval history. for a sort of genius to reflect contemporary realities. and, especially, for the touching portraits of kindness, duty spirit and sacrifice. for me, it is not a film of a story but the film of its characters. and lovely actors. a parable , serie.yes, i am not its fan. but i admitt - a am dependent by it. first, for the inspiration to use old great actors , from diana rigg to max von sydow. and, sure, for the great performances of young actors, from emilia clarke to maisie williams. the great virtue of serie - to remind the taste of classic fairy tales. and the charme, so seductive charme of them."
2019-05-26,kirpianuscus,the final taste,10,"after its end, expecting the prequel, the things are more clear. it is a great show. not only for the status of adaptation but for the science to be answer to many other adaptation. it is a serie of characters and their stories , more than the serie of a story itself. it is a modern fairy tale , the values and sins and failures and virtues are the same. it is a perfect trip guide across history lessons and the near every day reality. it is the perfect door to a fantastic - realistic universe. and, sure, it is got. not the lord of the rings, not lost, not the tudors or spartacus. just and only goot. the last season reminds this basic truth. dragons and cruel revenge ( many from us are expressions of frustrations and drawings of wrath), old sandals and swords in new version, sex and battles and traitors, and a drop of relation luke and anakin skywalker. and the end, the so infamous end for many from us, it is real perfect. for a simple reason- it is the fair eulogy of memory of humankind and the right gift to the small details defining us behind appearences. it remains, for me, more than a show, an adventure. eight seasons. long months expecting the next season. impressed by cruelty, in naked expressions, by courage and generosity and loyalty. by few splendid characters. by powerful scenes as the deaths of hodor or tommen baratheon. shocked by the execution of nedd stark, ball of feelings behind red wedding. feeling the radical transformation of daenerys , episode by episode, admiring the battle of winterfel, being impressed by the hard, almost crazy work of entire team. and admiring great actors doing , in impecable manner, theirs job. so, the final taste is marked by profound gratitude.including daniel banioff and d. b. weiss."
2020-01-02,kosmasp,A long time coming,8,"so i succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete box set came out in early december. the first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. as you may be able to tell, i have not read the source material. not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. so bare that in mind.now the line winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, i just never expected this to come up so early in the show. what is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. this keeps the viewers on their tows. towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).having said that, you can feel a drop in quality. and while i have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.also the conclusion (no worries, i'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. it feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. so if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, i might have gone farther down with my vote. then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, i might have given it a 10 too ... a prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but i would watch it. this achieved overall something that ""the reign"" could not: combine violence, fantasy and nudity into something mature/adult that works for men and women watching"
2021-09-13,classicsoncall,"""There's nothing more powerful in the world than a good story."" - Tyrion Lannister, Episode #8.6",7,"with over five thousand reviews already posted here for ""game of thrones"", there's really nothing i think i could add to indicate what an epic, kingdom spanning series this turned out to be. as is often the case, i'm late to the party for this program, but on the flip side, i was able to watch the entire series relatively uninterrupted over a span of a few weeks. the story telling and characters are spell binding, with twists that sometimes come out of nowhere that leave you gasping. not even the principals are immune, leading characters are often discarded just as you were beginning to relate to them, and often in a manner that's nasty and bloody. for a series this massive in scope, it would be hard to pick out a favorite character; up until the last season mine would have been daenerys targaryen stormborn (emilia clarke), with tyrion lannister (peter dinklage) a pretty close second. i think the reason so many folks were dismayed by the eighth and final season was because it ended by going against the grain of most viewers' expectation that jon snow (kit harington) would emerge as the king of the seven kingdoms, or at least a co,ruler with daenerys. my own feeling gravitated toward brandon the broken (isaac hempstead wright) around the time he became the three eyed raven. if you haven't seen this series yet, you might be intrigued enough to catch it after learning what cersei lannister (leana heady) stated to ned stark (sean bean) in episode #1.7 - ""when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die."""
2015-04-07,lee_eisenberg,"all fight for prestige, even when none is apparent",10,"i understand that george r. r. martin based ""a song of ice and fire"" on various and sundry wars and conquests throughout europe's history. indeed, the characters on ""game of thrones"" seem to have no aim except to fight for control of westeros. it is as though their quest for prestige has become an excuse to spend eternity fighting.i should note that this show is not for children. it's one of the most violent shows that i've ever seen. seriously, they leave little to the imagination. i've never read the books on which the series is based, but the series doesn't dumb anything down (understanding of course that it's fantasy).having just binge,watched the first season, i recommend the show. really impressive."
2015-09-05,jboothmillard,Game of Thrones,8,"this was a show i had heard a lot about, i assumed it was one with a cult following, in fact it has become more and more popular as time and seasons go by, so i decided to get into it as well. basically the show is based on a series of fantasy novels by george r. r. martin, it is set in the fictional continents of westeros and essos in the seven kingdoms (the north, the iron islands, the vale, the westerlands, the stormlands, the reach, and dorne). there are three narratives that go on throughout the show, the first being a civil war among several noble houses for the iron throne of the seven kingdoms, the second being attempts to exile the descendants of the ruling dynasty to reclaim the throne, and the third being the rising threat of the inpending winter and fierce creatures and fierce people from the north. within in the series are several plots and story lines, and a broad ensemble cast of characters, said to be the largest in television history, and winning a guinness world record for this. starring golden globe and emmy winning and four,time nominated peter dinklage as tyrion lannister, twice emmy nominated lena headey as

edward tudor-pole as protester, ian mcshane and max von sydow as three-eyed raven. to be completely honest, i cannot keep up with absolutely every storyline going on, because there are so many characters, in fact i have probably only memorised less than ten of the character names. the biggest reason i keep watching is because of the exciting fight and chase scenes when they happen, the great special effects to bring dragons, ghosts, zombie and all other mythical creatures to life, the over-the-top bloody violence and deaths, and the frequent nudity and sexual activity. this does not mean i do not like the show overall, i am always interested to see what will happen next with the faces of the characters i recognise, so it is certainly a worthwhile fantasy drama. it was nominated the golden globe for best television series – drama (twice), it won the primetime emmys for outstanding art direction for a single-camera series (also nominated), outstanding costumes for a series (also nominated twice), outstanding makeup for a single-camera series (non-prosthetic) (twice, also nominated), outstanding sound editing for a series (also nominated three times), outstanding sound

2020-01-10,tweekums,A modern classic on an epic scale,8,"this epic series is set in a fantasy world like no other i can think of. it has the look of medieval europe with rival families manoeuvring to take the iron throne on which the kings of westeros sit. as the series begins robert baratheon is the king and he invites this friend ned stark to be his hand, most trusted advisor. this leads to ned, his wife and daughters; sansa and arya, moving to the capital... it isn't long before they are caught up in court intrigue. robert's wife is involved with her own brother; it is learnt that the children of the last slain king are still alive... and there are rumours that the dead are returning to life north of the wall in the far north, where ned's illegitimate son jon is stationed. they are expected to attack next winter!as the series progresses rival families fight each other, form and break alliances. other characters work for personal advancement knowing that if the move to soon or side with the wrong people their lives will soon be over. the villains are truly villainous; the heroes aren't as clear cut as one might expect. the cast of major characters is huge and events in the first season shockingly show that even those set up as lead characters can be killed off. there are fantasy elements; most notably three dragons belonging to daenerys targaryen; the white walkers (the army of the dead); and magic of melisandre, the red woman but for the most part things are gritty and real. often that means brutal violence, quite a bit of nudity and lots of swearing... this of course means that the series won't be for everybody; however if you don't turn off in disgust in the opening few episodes you'll probably want to watch it all and love it. the cast does a phenomenal job; this includes many established actors as well as up and coming stars and people for whom this was their first acting job such as young actresses sophie turner and maisie williams who play sansa and arya stark who's characters develop across many seasons in ways one wouldn't imagine when it started. there is also a stellar performance from peter dinklage who plays dwarf tyrion lannister; a character that dominates just about every scene he is in despite his diminutive size. others who must be mentioned are sean bean, emilia clarke, kit harrington, lena headey, aiden gillen, charles dance and jack gleeson... to be honest i could go on listing almost everybody in it! the special effects are fantastic; one could almost believe that dragons are real after watching this. the world in which the series is set is filmed in a wide range of countries giving it a very real feel... gone are the days when a major us series set in numerous locations will be filmed entirely in southern california or the pacific north west! overall i can only say 'watch this' as i loved it from start to finish."
2014-06-18,ma-cortes,"Impressive epic with plenty of violence , fierce combats , plot twists , gore and blood .",10,"this is a violently graphic and strong retelling about facing off among various families in an undetermined time . nine noble families battle for control of the mythical land of westeros. robert baratheon (mark addy) , king of westeros, asks his old friend eddard ¨ned¨(sean bean), lord stark, to serve as hand of the king, or highest official. when ned returned to winterfell at the end of robert's rebellion, he had a bastard son, jon snow, by an unknown woman he had met in the south. he raised jon alongside his five trueborn children robb (richard madden) , sansa (sophie turner) , arya (maisie williams) , bran (isaac hempstead wright) , and rickon (art parkinson) . along with the stark family is theon (alfie allen), he became a ward of lord eddard ""ned"" stark at winterfell, and he became close with robb . although ned is secretly warned that the previous hand was assassinated, eddard accepts in order to investigate further . meanwhile the queen's family, the lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power . there appears tyrion (peter dinklage) the third and youngest son of lord tywin (charles dance) and lady joanna lannister. because of his unusual stature tyrion has been a victim of mockery his entire life, with people overlooking his noble birth in order to tease and taunt him. tyrion's mother died giving birth to him and his father and older sister cersei (lena headey) have despised him all his life as a result. he has always maintained a close relationship with his elder brother ser jaime lannister (nikolaj coaster,waldau), cersei's twin . across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne . as daenerys (emilia clarke) is the only daughter of aerys ii targaryen and rhaella targaryen , she is now a princess living in exile, the last of the targaryens . but daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the seven kingdoms. all while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the night's watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond . there finds jon snow (kit harington) , the bastard son of lord ned stark by an unknown mother , it is here that the skills that were passed on to him by ned come to light as jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the wall. this is a spectacular epic dealing with friction between the houses stark, lannister, baratheon and targaryen and with the remaining great houses greyjoy, tully, arryn,tyrell and martell and in which political and sexual intrigue is pervasive ; all of them lead to full-scale war . breathtaking epic version based on george rr martin novels with exciting drama and overwhelming combats , his stories are imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios . sword cross , intense drama , nudism , sexual scenes , and bloody fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation . magnificent climatic battle scenes and struggles including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images including heinous dragons . the series is well written by an excellent plethora of screenwriters as david benioff , d.b. weiss , vanessa taylor under supervision by the great creator george r.r. martin . this author was asked if he had a resolution or ending to the seemingly endless conflict , he replied that the end would be a cloud of dust or snow being driven by the wind across a vast graveyard full of tombstones. the series takes its name from the first novel in the book series ""a game of thrones"" - which is actually known as ""a song of ice and fire"",and most of the show is largely faithful to the books . george r.r. martin's story credit acknowledges the entire series under this title, rather than the title of individual volumes. george r.r. martin has stated that the infamous ""red wedding"" was the hardest chapter for him to write in ""a storm of swords."" he was so emotionally attached to the characters that he actually wrote the rest of the book first, and then that chapter last ."
2016-08-15,paul_haakonsen,The game is on...,7,"as a life,long fan of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game, it is a hard thing to not be familiar with the ""game of thrones"" series. and yet it took me five years after the pilot to start watching it. but it should be said, then, that i haven't been able to stop watching it since i started, and i have sat through four of the seasons so far in a very short time.what works for me in ""game of thrones"" is the extensive storyline, with multiple houses working against one another or with one another all in order to obtain power, wealth and the crown to the realm. but also the myriad of intricate and detailed characters that are in the series, that is just spectacular. especially because anyone of these characters can die on a whim, so you never know who is safe.the costumes are sets are fantastic, especially because there is so much attention to detail, both mundane and flashy. and it really works out so well, because you really think that you are in a medieval fantasy setting with dragons and knights. and also the special effects play a big role in the series, although not the point where the show is dependent on the special effects. of course, having good cgi is particularly important if the dragons were to be realistic and believable.i like the politics and the alliances and feuds between the different houses and affiliations, because it is played out so well, and it is really well thought through by the creator.one thing that really is a thorn in my side if the excessive amount of nudity in the show, because it really sleazes up the series unnecessarily. the show would work out equally well with much less nudity and done in a more presentable way. but also the constant excessive use of foul language; here i am thinking of the ""f-word"" and the ""c-word"" that most of the characters are using frequently. it really seems out of place with the setting and atmosphere of the series, plus is also adds a wholly unnecessary level of unpleasantness. i am not a prude, but i think it is so frequent in the series that it is a downright annoyance.you quickly find your favorite character or characters in the myriad of colorful, quirky, scheming, bold, defiant and lovable characters. and likewise, you also quickly find ones that you most definitely do not like or even downright loathe. for me, the king joffrey character was one that i instantly despised, he really pulled every wrong string in my being. nothing against jack gleeson as an actor, it was just the character that he portrayed. and as such, when a series manages to instill such a relationship between the viewer and fictional characters, then the series is really worth watching, appealing to you on more than just an entertainment level.the slow build up of various events, and how the events have effects on the various houses and factions like ripples in a pond, really add enjoyment to the show. and you want to see more and learn what will happen next and see how the epic tale unfolds. who will live and who will die? who will stand victorious when the dust settles?""game of thrones"" is really worth watch, especially if you enjoy the fantasy genre. i am rating it a solid eight out of ten stars, and the reason for it not scoring nine or even ten stars from me is solely because of the unnecessary nudity and foul language."

2019-05-20,grantss,Good but not great: massively over-rated,10,"(updated after season 8)set in a fantasy land (though, in many ways, very similar to earth in the middle ages) the stories of several families and individuals and their quest for power. in particular, they all want the iron throne...good, epic, fantasy drama, based on the books by george rr martin. started extremely well: the focus on several individuals, the clever interlocking story lines, the weaving together of family feuds, power trips and pure greed and malice. add in superb cinematography, settings, scenery and cgi, spot,on performances and some great battle scenes and we had an intriguing, engaging, action-packed drama.one of the early trademarks of the show was the principle that all characters are expendable: characters, often heroes and seemingly there for the long haul, get killed off in the blink of an eye, and out of the blue. this is good and bad. good in that it shows that, as in life, there are no certainties and ""heroes"" / very likeable characters with depth aren't necessarily immortal (this is definitely not disney!). on the other hand, it leaves you feeling distant and unengaged. it's difficult to support a character when they could be killed off at any moment.the other issue early on was that there are possibly too many stories being told simultaneously. too many characters in the story i didn't care about (though the previous issue diluted this phenomenon somewhat!). this is particularly so in seasons 3 and 4.while the plot is good and the characters have depth, it isn't all substance: style plays its part and sometimes the dial is too much over to the style side. over time, style starts to overwhelm substance.this all said, it does start to come together from season 5 onwards. seasons 1 and 2 were good, and set up the story for some great development in season 3. unfortunately, seasons 3 and 4 drifted somewhat. season 5 gets us back on track and season 6 propelled the story forward in a big way.season 7 is where the individual, seemingly parallel at times, stories start to come together, as we start to effectively get one story, rather than several. it also set up the series for the final season, which promised to be a humdinger....which it certainly wasn't. game of thrones season 8 would have to be one of the most eagerly anticipated final seasons in tv history...and one of the worst (and i've watched the final seasons of dexter and true blood!). having created the mythical world and developed the plot to this thrilling climax, spending eight years in doing so, the writers seemed to not know how to end it. pacing is uneven, some plot developments are quite laughable (deux ex machina, anyone...), direction is weird at times - artsy for the sake of it (episode 3...) and there's far more style than substance (and the style feels forced).the final episode does tie things up quite neatly but more with a whimper than a bang. very disappointing, especially considering the build-up.less drifting in the middle seasons (even cull one or two seasons), a tighter final season and no zombies (the white walkers were a waste of time - a distraction from the real confrontation) and this would have been brilliant."
2017-09-03,alsexgal,Game of Thrones - king of all TV dramas in current production...,6,"... as i am writing this. if the first season seems boring to you (that seems to be the biggest complaint i've heard from people who don't like the show) just push through anyway. if by episode 10 you still aren't hooked, i'd be really surprised.it's fantasy medieval material with lots of characters, plots and settings. almost all of the characters are interesting and multidimensional, supported by very good acting for this type of show and for the immense quantity of characters involved (and half a dozen of them bringing really high level acting talent in general). almost every character has their own backstory that makes their actions relatable, from tywin, whose weak father almost lost their family seat, to joffrey who got told he is the greatest of the world from his birth and became a spoiled brat. hardly any character has ""plot armor"", so nearly anyone can die at any second with the momentum changing completely. the dialogue is excellent, based on the excellent writing from the books. it has terrific world,building, a lot of attention to detail, amazing production value in every technical aspect (soundtrack is amazing, cinematography is impressive, the locations are great). there are great battles and special effects. it is full of unexpected but consistent plot-twists, and it's extremely focused on details and foreshadowing, which makes every scene potentially important and provides a rich ground for theories on future plots and speculation on answers for the dozens of mysteries the show introduces. it is highly immersive and dark, good things happen to bad people all the time, as bad things happen to good people, which is frustrating and infuriating most of the time, but that makes it so unpredictable and also helps with creating connections to the characters and making you really invested in what's going to happen next."
2011-09-30,phd_travel,Very unpleasant and not very original,7,"i had to watch this because others were watching it and i tried to be open minded and see what all the fuss was about. seriously how did such a silly novel came to screen! this shouldn't have been done by hbo. it' just nerd fantasy fiction. what a derivative story! they just throw in all sorts of shocking and titillating nonsense to make a story but it's all so silly. there is just so much gross stuff: the incest, the beheading and other dismemberments, the token homosexuals, the gratuitously violent sword fighting and last but not least the ""golden crown"". i'm reminded of what many prominent authors and critics got together to say about harry potter: the sight of grown people reading the books is distressing. the same can be said of game of thrones. except game is full of so many unpleasant characters. the cast tries hard but they are wasted. they are almost all irritating and to kill of sean bean leaving only lena headey as a cast member of stature! can't bear to think of season 2 relying on the remaining cast. i think the worst part was watching emilia clarke talk that strange language for minutes on end.were there any good points? just the effort put in production set design and makeup. jason momoa does look like a human monster here. the vaguely british irish medieval castles and settings are well done. its just a shame so much effort went into such drivel."
2011-04-18,gradyharp,Heads up for GAME OF THRONES,10,"it has begun! the much touted hbo miniseries a game of thrones arrived with episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 george r.r. martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'a song of ice and fire'. the 'game' is played by seven families , stark, lannister, baratheon, greyjoy, tully, arryn, and tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come. in this first episode lord eddard stark (sean bean) is the patriarch of house stark, one of the major noble houses of the seven kingdoms of westeros and ancestral rulers of the north. near the castle of winterfell, eddard's children discover a dead direwolf and five of its pups still alive. as the direwolf is the symbol of the starks, eddard allows each of his five children to keep one of the pups as pet. a sixth pup is discovered a short distance away from the others. it is a mute albino, and this one is given to jon snow (kit harington), the bastard son of lord eddard stark. king robert baratheon (mark addy) , eddard's childhood friend, journeys to winterfell with his family to ask eddard to become hand of the king, the top adviser and military commander in the realm, due to the death of the previous hand, lord jon arryn. eddard's wife, catelyn stark (michelle fairley), receives a letter from her sister lysa arryn, stating that jon arryn's death was a murder plotted by queen cersei (lena headey) and her powerful family, the lannisters. though reluctant to leave his duties and family, eddard is convinced by his wife to accept the position in order to investigate jon arryn's death. eddard's middle son bran stark (isaac hempstead-wright) is engaging in climbing winterfell castle's walls and towers accidentally sees queen cersei and her twin brother jaime lannister (nikolaj coaster-waldau) having incestuous relations. to protect their secret affair, jaime throws the boy out of a tower window. where the story goes form here will follow throughout the remaining episodes. though some would criticize an early report on a series merely at its inception, it seems only fitting that offering a word on encouragement to pay attention to this new series is warranted. we can only hope that the series continues to build as it progresses. the cast is filled with excellent actors, both seasoned and refreshingly new. grady harp"
2021-08-18,safenoe,Season 6 was a downer,7,"being a got fan, i greatly admired the writing here and great to see bold choices in writing made. season 6 was quite a downer with quality slipping in casting choices, but it picked up later on thankfully."
2019-05-10,mm-39,Well the first couple of season where good!,10,"well the first couple of seasons where good! game of thrones has magic, dragons, action, and drama; with a hard does of x rated scenes and nudity. game of thrones has h b o movie quality, sets, and a list actors.
game of thrones follows a good mix with some of england's history which give a real feel for the major story line mixed in with magically fantasy. (ie the wall the romans built around scotland) like the sopranos h b o made a fresh, cutting edge, and raw series. regrettably the later years of the series becomes formulated, redundant, and hemmed in; much like the walking dead series. does anyone watch the walking dead anymore? well the killing off of lead characters, and introduction of new characters creates new life for a series. regrettable the second half of game of thrones loses steam like most series. 7 out of 10 stars."
2017-08-30,deloudelouvain,Best fantasy series ever,8,"definitely one of the best fantasy series ever. i don't think i ever saw a better one. at least i can't remember a better one. i write this after the seventh season and it's still as good as the beginning. that's says it all. the acting is excellent. there are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. but all the characters are worth watching, every single one of them. and don't get too attached to a character because it could be over for him or her in any episode. never saw so many main characters being killed or murdered as in game of thrones. and that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. in every season characters that you would think will survive die. the battles are epic, the story could go in any direction anytime. betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything. i'm a devoted fan, so devoted i already have three tattoos about it. house targayen rules!"
2012-04-22,vincentiu,impressive,10,"loyalty for novel, spectacular show, magnificent adaptation of each detail. sure, not a real surprise for hbo but it is a major success to create an entire world in so manner. the key , perfect cast and power of images. the freedom for each step of tale and mixture of seduction and cold view. exercise of masterpiece, it is more than adaptation. the colors are part of nuances. the dialog is seed of events. the territories - pieces of huge puzzle - are slices of tasty bread. the force of measure is the rule, secret and miracle to make this extraordinary work. no drop of speculation, only ash honey of a monumental river of survive."
2020-03-05,dkosty123,Massive Cast Epic HBO Production,8,"yes, this is sort of a middle ages feud, the lannisters and the starks and the battles of the 7 kingdoms from north to south. the locales range from the wall to winterfell, to kings landing. every episode has opening credits with maps of all the kingdoms which change as events happen. using an original book of fire and ice, the series starts off magnificently with many power grabbing events and executions. the list of characters grows week to week, and some executions end many cast members stay on the show.the actor who is in the most episodes is a lannister played by peter dinkvage. while peter is short in stature, his acting is high in caliber. he is nearly killed early in the series, but like a phoenix he continues to rise from his own demise to become a power broker for the dragon lady. she is a southern ruler who owns 3 dragons and heads a powerful army who wants to rule the 12 kingdoms. normally, this would be an easy task.then there are the starks who rule winterfell and the north. to complicate matters, there is the army of the dead. early on in the series they only make brief attacks on small bands of troops. then as more people are killed, the amry of the dead gets bigger and bigger and become a bigger and bigger threat. there's a lot of excellent character development in the earliest parts of this series. the middle age world of kingdoms have many interesting little asides.then as we wind into the last seasons, an alliance is created to face the army of the dead in sort of a middle age world war. the climatic battle is long and drawn out, as the author is no longer working on the scripts and the material has diminished considerably. overall the series quality is very high up until the segment leading to the big battle. that is when we lose character development and the series is totally immersed in the final battle.the way to watch this now is to get the dvds and absorb it at your leisure, is it worth watching? definitely. is the ending satisfactory? that depends on your point of view. it does prove that game on is more than just an hour, and it makes the middle age world more complicated than i ever imagined."
2018-09-19,rainey-dawn,Outstanding Series,10,"there's nothing i can say that hasn't already been said: it's a fantastic series. i did not see this series for a few years , didn't have the means to do so. i finally bought the series on dvd to watch because i had to see this series. i knew i would love it - and others that have seen it kept reminding me of it and telling me i must watch it! i'm glad others prodded me about it and happy i bought it for viewing. i fell in-love as i knew i would. i will buy season 8 when it comes out - i have to see the ending and complete the set. if you still haven't seen this series and love medieval fantasy then i highly recommend this for viewing - i would prod you to watch as i was - you won't be disappointed! 10/10"

(1 viewing)
spoilers
i could type an essay on everything wrong with the finale and this season as a whole but i don't feel like wasting my time. i will assume the show ends before jon's convo with tyrion. everything after didn't happen. and that still leaves a bunch of issues i had with the rest of the season. like khaleesi turning evil so suddenly and surprisingly"
2011-07-20,red_identity,A fantastic story with visually-amazing sequences,10,"i have finished the first season of game of thrones and all i can say is that it was simply fantastic! boardwalk empire has been the hbo series that has gained the most attention, but in all honesty i felt a little disappointed by that one. here, it's anything but.first off, for a medieval fantasy television series, the performances are all fantastic. every single performer steps up to the plate. sean benn and michelle fairley are as perfect protagonists as one could hope for. yet the ones that even outshined them at times include lena headey (who at times you feel her pain and at times you just want to cut her head off), nikolaj coaster is also pretty fantastic, as is peter dinklage (who is the most likable lannister!). kit harrington and richard madden are pretty incredible as well and show great future potential. the directing and writing are not over,dramatic and the story lines are actually pretty unpredictable after a while. yet there are still many melodramatic moments, but for the better.the art direction is superb, as is the cinematography as expected. this is basically watching a film. i don't want to overdo these statements since i am sure everyone pretty much knows it, but overall, this was fantastic season. oh, and the music score and opening credits are the best on tv!"

2019-05-27,irishchatter,It was an absolute rollercoaster but the ending was the only disappointing one for me...,4,"first of all, i honestly enjoyed watching all season's of this show with the family despite the amount of sex as well barbaric scenes involved lol. second, i thought got was a pretty great show that has really interesting likeable characters in it, especially the baddies like cersei, the night king, daenerys targaryen, you name it!with the last season, i was so disappointed that daenerys and cersei didn't get to fight one,to-one and the fact daenerys didn't get the throne in the end. it would've made more sense if both did happen as she was striving to get that crown and totally wanted to have a chat with cersei in order to gain the crown herself! instead it ended up cersei ending up dead with jamie when the castle was under attack and jon snow killing daenerys just because she turned out to be a madhatter who killed nearly every person in kings landing. i totally wanted her to be the queen of the 7 kingdoms and she was my favourite character of all time in the series. i honestly was so sad but not surprised she did die. as much as bran is a good character, i wouldn't have thought of him as a king type like i felt it was rather forceful that they made him king and he didn't want to be king. however it was a good sign that we get to see something different on a tv show which is electing a person with a disability to be king. it gives a good insight that anyone with a physical disability can be anything they strive out to be! people were saying he was a useless character but i disagree, he was actually pretty useful when it came down to tracking the night king and letting the guys know that the night king was on the way to look for him among with his night watch a army.i like the fact george r martin is not gonna tell us the actual ending of the game of thrones books as he's still writing the last two volumes. you'd think the man would give us a actual answer then a ""yes or no"" at the same time. we might as well get reading the books folks to find it out ourselves lol!the show is entertaining like it does reflect on some parts of history where european royalty from different lands would fought each other in order to gain the ultimate crown. it's just unfortunate that it couldn't have a better satisfying ending but at the same time, if you like your fantasy/medieval/comedy/bloody battle/drama/horror genres, then mate, this is totally for you! definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen got before, you'd be in for a ride seriously!"

2016-10-04,bored_dragon,LOTR of the TV World,7,"lotr of the tv world 4 october 2016tv shows i rated 10 are rare, i could count them on one hand. and this is one of them. the excellent crew did this based on the fantastic book and in cooperation with the original writer. i do not want to compare this show with anything else because it is beyond any comparison, but speaking only about its quality, this is for the tv world what ""lord of the rings"" is for movies. i doubt anyone will top this any time soon.new books are not out yet, and producers decided not to wait for them, so series are ahead of the books now. i did not watch the latest season yet, and i see many bad impressions and comments on the web, but even if they really did a lousy job on this last season, the previous five seasons are so good that last one cannot spoil average grade below ten out of ten. unfortunately, i did not see the famous ""breaking bad"" yet, so i cannot be 100% sure, but for me, this is the very best tv show ever made. for the first time in my life i will give money for the series and, when the series is completed, buy the original box,set edition. it pains me to admit, but tolkien is overthrown - i prefer ""got"" over ""lotr"", both in a written and screened version.i am not writing about its contents, there is more than enough spoilers all around the web, so no need for me to add some more. thou, i do not understand all that noise and complaining about spoilers, especially if the movie/series is based on a famous book. in my opinion, you should always read the book before you watch it on tv, and if you did it then you already know most of what you'll see, so complaining about spoilers is ridiculous. and believe me, even if it is not always the case, in this case, you really should read the books first. it is impossible to put all those thousands of pages in a tv show, and reading the books will allow you a much better understanding of what you see and you will enjoy the show much much more. i'm not saying that books are better. not this time. both are great in their own way. but the show will hypnotize you even deeper if you read the books first.10/10and what am i supposed to watch now that won't seem totally lame after seeing ""got""...
11 february 2020the eighth season is over and with it the already cult ""game of thrones"". the flood of spoilers and complaining over the last season receded, the dust settled, and it's time for me to finally see it in its entirety. i decided not to continue where i left off, but to start from the beginning and watch it without gigantic breaks between episodes and seasons.even before it starts, the series leaves you breathless with its phenomenal opening credits. although a bit too long for my taste, it is certainly one of the most impressive introduction clips i have ever seen, mostly because of beautiful music by ramin djawadi.""game of thrones"", the first book of the cult saga ""a song of ice and fire,"" i first read in the summer of 2007. when i first sat down to watch the series in 2011, it seemed like the book was coming alive. most of the scenes were shot exactly the way i imagined them while reading, and the cast is predominantly perfectly selected. i remember that only young targaryens, and especially their hair, were torn in my eye. emilia clarke, in my opinion, is not beautiful/handsome enough or good enough actress for the role of daenerys, and it took me more than a season to get used to her. maisie williams was initially very antipathic, but she quickly gained me with quality acting. the rest of the cast has been so impressive since the start that, when i continued reading the books, i began to imagine them exactly as they were shown in the series. what separates ""game of thrones"" the most from the majority of representatives of the genre is realistic characterization. there are no good guys and bad guys here, no black-and-white struggle between good and evil. all the characters are deeply layered and their good and bad sides take turns from situation to situation.the first episode starts the series with force and ruthlessness, and although it is only a preliminary introduction to the story, it already manages to shock us on several occasions with its explicitness, vulgarity, and brutality. if you, while watching this episode, even for a moment felt discomfort, better stop here, because of what follows in the episodes and seasons that are in front of you your stomach will turn inside out.already in the second episode, martin begins to kill innocent, ruthlessly introducing us into a world in which no one is safe, and in which the main characters are dropping like flies, alongside extras. characters that die without any order, sense, and logic, whose stories remain incomplete because they are suddenly stricken by bad luck, are martin's trademark. the series, as well as the source novel, constantly keeps you in a state of tension, because deaths, intrigues, and plot twists are totally unexpected and unpredictable, as is the real life.which brings us to the controversial last season. as far as i noticed, nagging about the last season is focused primarily on the script and the characters' illogical and unprovoked moves. i was bothered by the chaotic directing and editing. the episode depicting the battle against the army of the dead made my eyes literally hurt and, in my opinion, music was inadequate and irritating. but i have no major objections to the story itself. we are used to movies where the end logically follows from the introduction and plot, but it usually happens only in stories. life is not logical, and i have already mentioned that martin is quite realistic. people change, evolve, make plans, wage internal struggles, fight for a goal and, while the endings of most films show them failing or achieving those goals, life often stops those life paths with unexpected death and makes the whole journey meaningless. death simply undoes us. likewise, in the last season, martin just canceled out a bunch of characters and their stories, while others acted impulsively, made fatal mistakes, or simply went mad. many have completed their journeys in somewhat karmically acceptable ways, and the fates of some have surprised us. the season is a little hectic, but i don't think this story could have ended much differently, and i'm definitely not disappointed.last season, in my opinion, deserves no more than a seven or an eight, but the overall impression of the entire series remains10/10"
2014-10-10,851222,"A truly unique, brilliant show",1,"greetings from lithuania.""game of thrones"" (2011,) is arguably the best current show in a world. it has everything to be on top, and it is. i won't say nothing new that wasn't already said before, but still... this is brilliant show from start till finish, in every direction. probably there wasn't a show before with this big, rich ambitious scope. yes, it's based on amazing material, but realize it on the screen takes a guts, money and talent. no other network couldn't pull it of, except hbo. you can clearly see every dollar that was spent on screen, and usually, not in directly way - i mean the locations, settings, costumes, art design, special effects - it's all there, you can almost feel it. i won't lie, i don't like fantasy genre in general, but ""game of thrones"" sucks you in from the opening scene and doesn't let go. to appreciate this show you don't have read books - just enjoy the beat, small things on screen - when you will see them, the whole picture will come itself. i could talk for hours of how brilliant this thing is, but you have to see it by yourself to understand.overall, 4 seasons have gone, and it's a solid 10/10 for ""game of thrones"" - a truly unique and almost flawless adventure in every direction - it's dark, gruesome, gritty and unforgettable, a must see for everyone and even those who don't like fantasy - you won't regret it."
2020-01-07,westsideschl,Season 8 - Inconsistent Storytelling,9,"positive: good hard work to prepare locations, sets, makeup, cgi, etc. minor negatives: excessive emphasis on killing, most of which came across as not too believable even for a fantasy. seemed modern daytime soap opera like in clearing up romantic hook,ups - hasty & artificial.
major negatives: for seven seasons we have daenerys portraying a fantasy god like goodness & courage. season 8, right off the bat, i sensed something wrong when as she enters the city, dragons flying over & frightening people, i see her smirking in a self-indulgent, petty, ""aren't i great pose."" humans are consistent over a period of time as to their personality & values - they don't suddenly turn 180 degrees. more inconsistencies followed.
the other discomforting characterization, most all the females were flawed even arya abandons helping to go off on her own personal quest. main example is cersei shown as raised in spoiled wealth; illicit & immoral sex; narcissistic; dispassionately abandons allies; avoided military service so lacks remorse/understanding in her slaughtering innocents - very trump like for her era. tyrion sums it up - ""what unites people? armies? gold? flags? - stories!"". for me, yes stories, thus the final year let 8 seasons of story down."
2016-06-23,jacobjohntaylor1,This is a great fantasy,6,this is a very good fantasy show. you should see this show. it is a great show. it has great acting. it also has great special effects. it is not a 9.5 that is kind of overrating it. but still a very good show. there are actors in this that were in lord of the rings. this show is awesome. see it. it is a great show. i need more lines and i am running out of things to say. this a great show. peter dinklage is a great actor. lena heady is a great actress. david benioff a great writer . i give this show 7 out 10. see this show it is very scary. emilia clarke is a great actress do not miss this show. kit harington is a great actress.
2019-06-01,harry_tk_yung,Romances throughout the 8 seasons,9,"this is a collection of my observations and thoughts, on a specific subject. there is, needless to say, a proliferation of possible subjects , death, betrayal, revenge, loyalty, heroism, friendship, family, etc etc. the one i am going to focus on is romance, with specific reference to the first- and second-tier characters. a general observation is that except for one, none of these romances end well.i am going to start with the starks.the romance that i possibly like best in the entire series is robert and talisa stark. a strong contender would be ygritte and jon knower-of-nothing snow but i'll come to that later. the two above-mentioned women are also my top favorite female characters. but alas, the robert/talisa romance, which is perfect, is also short-lived. the beautiful couple is killed at the red wedding.next comes sansa who, as we know, is arguably the character that has grown most over the 8 seasons. the adolescent girl's fantasy about romance is quickly and brutally annihilated. towards the end, i actually hoped that sansa and tyrion will consummate their marriage and jointly rule the seven kingdoms. but that is not to be.there was one brief moment when something may blossom between bran stark and meera reed. with the trajectory that is bran's ""story"" (courtesy tyrion) was taking, however, this is understandably nib in the bud. in terms of basic personality arya has not really changed as much as her sister. arya just expanded. i do like her connecting with gendry and there are advocates that they should jointly rule the seven kingdoms. but the romance, after all, is not totally convincing. more like a passing infatuation, when it seems that that world was going to end.i think i'll include jon snow under the starks. frankly, i don't find the romance between jon and dany convincing. more like a plot device. i am sure that there are at least some who would agree with me that the romance between jon and ygritte is among the most touching in the series. it is not unlike a fateful romeo and juliette love affair (except that here we have an amazon of a juliette).so, no happy endings in stark romances. let's move on to the lannister.
jamie and brienne, after starting out on a rocky road, wound up having everybody rooting for them. indeed, they are the nearest to being soulmates, not the least because they both rank among the top fighters in westeros. those who remember may recall that the flower knight bested jamie, and later brienne beat the flower knight, even before we know the face behind the helmet belong to someone call lady brienne. given that those two battles were tournaments and not real fighting, that still means something. it is sad to see that his destiny was not to spend the rest of his life growing old with her.
tyrion, i mentioned in conjunction with sansa, married but entirely unromantic. they do make a very good pair though and should be the best choice to rule the seven kingdoms. they each did quite well though, as queen of the independent north and hand of the king of the six kingdoms. happy endings, although separately.on the baratheon, i mentioned gendry in conjunction with arya. renly, probably the best of them, would make a best-looking pair with margaery tyrell, even when that was only for shows as he loved her brother instead, the flower knight. in any event he was murdered by witchcraft, starting margaery's career as a professional baratheon widow. from her second husband hideous monster joffrey she was saved by angelic grandma lady olenna, the queen of thorns, via poisoning him. the third husband tommen was a sweet boy king, who did not make her a widow but instead killed himself after she died in his mother's hands, sort of a poetic justice revenge ""you kill someone i love, and now i kill someone you love"".with the lesser characters, there are two romance that ended tragically, at the opposite ends of the social spectrum: grey worm and missandei; princess myrcella and prince trystane.is there any romance that ended happily? the obvious one is sam and gilly. and they were even blessed with their own offspring eventually. it was such sublime mirth to watch how sam, embarrassingly and apologetically, explained to jon the reason why gilly was pregnant was because after reading all the books, he still had plenty of time and nothing much to do in the citadel.finally, i must mention one relationship that is so unique that defies description. certainly not romance. he was on her to-kill list. she was his bounty-hunter's prize for a handsome ransom. situations evolved. when they met again in the final season, he said ""the last time we met, you left me to die"". her reply: ""first, i robbed you"". in the end, they were travel companions for one last time, both seeking death. in the very end, when the hound went to meet his destiny at the so-called ""clegane bowl"" he accomplished on final good deed: success in convincing arya that she needed not, and should not die. her parting three words to him ""sandor. (pause) thank you"" is the nearing thing in the entire 8 seasons to bringing me to tears."
2020-08-27,john6daniels,be careful,5,a cult show that could not brainwash me to join in on the suffering.9.3. for what?if this is 9.3 that means its really 3.9. that makes more sense.verdict: don't watch this cult show.
2017-07-31,top_dawg_critic,Best show ever!,8,"game of thrones, the best tv show ever! but y'all know that already. there is nothing more that i can praise that hasn't been said on here already.i'm just here to put my 2 cents worth in because i'm a huge fan.i will admit i waited till the hype was still on during season 3 before i said ""ok, gotta see what all then hype is about"", and thus i binge watched the first 2 seasons and every season thereafter.pure genius! a perfect 10/10!"
2019-05-09,tweetienator,Fallen From the Skies,10,"i will make it short , the first five seasons are top-notch and the show really entertained and got me for those years and was imo always exceptional, best of the best so to say, and a new milestone in making a tv-show.both season 6 and 7 could not hold the level of the first five seasons, but were still okay, but season 8 is a really bad thing and a steep drop in quality regarding storytelling: too blunt, too boring (because predictable) and on top too many mistakes occur - just too many to ingnore and not to notice. also the killing of the night king is a rather poor choice of execution.and why our beloved dragon queen does not just circle the fleet and burn them to ashes from behind may be a mystery for ever (all ships just had catapults on the front/bow). or e.g. mysterioulsy half of the armies of the allies somehow survived the battle against the undead (following the shown battle it looked like nobody but a very few survived - not to mention all those bad strategic choices in battle and in preperation for the battle).anyway, gone are the times with many interesting characters and exotic places and plots over plots, and therefore it is a good thing that this is the last season and the curtains will be closed for good. also, i should add, i tuned down my hopes a lot for the upcoming prequel show. i fear we will get something rather ordinary. hopefully, mr. martin provides us a better finale to his game of thrones.ratings:
season 1 to 5 = 9
season 6 to 7 = 7
season 8 = 4 (ep 4 aired)addition: the resolution of the show - what a predictable, boring and cliched mess... years and years of a fine show and then we get this big rushed let-down. just terrible. last note: i thought i would buy all seasons on dvd, instead i sold the ones i already got..."
2019-03-09,digitalbeachbum,I just started watching today,9,"so i didn't have hbo and they offered it for free and i decided to watch got. at first it was interesting and it had promise, but then it quickly turned in to shock jock value.boobs are nice, but are they really needed? sex? why do you need it? sure violence exists, but is it really needed? bloodshed? sure but why so much of it? is there not enough story and dialog to carry the show? is all this other shock value to fill the emptiness.i've watched a lot of movies and read a lot of books, but this isn't on the top of my list. there is some interesting crossover arcs with the story, there are some characters i want to see die, others that i want to see succeed. however that is about it with the first season.i'll continue watching, but i don't expect it to be any better. it's cookie cutter stuff with out any real substance(edit)just watched an episode which had some fighting. i'm familiar with ancient combat, weapons and armor. the scene was so completely unrealistic it was laughable. so much so i'm taking off two other stars.this show uses deus ex machina too much. they need something to happen, so they just wham! kill some people, show some blood, have some sex.(edit) so i noticed that they tend to repeat the story line a lot in the first season. i hope this is the case for the rest of the show.to give you a small example. i watched the first three episodes and started to get a little bored. the show wasn't really progressing forward and seemed to stall.by the fourth episode the show literally started to repeat scenes. i kept saying, hey that happened previously.i went from episode #4 to #8 and didn't see anything new. it wasn't until the scene where the dance master fought the attackers that i found anything interesting.and i thought these episodes were one hour long, but 3 1/2 minutes are a recap and intro, then there is 10 minutes at the end for some kind of director's dialog over what is happening in the show. these shows aren't even a full hour and they don't have enough content to fill it?"
2019-06-11,southdavid,Doesn't quite stick the Kings Landing.,9,"a few weeks have passed now since the end of the final series, and although i didn't take it as badly as many others, i still wanted a bit of distance before i sat down to try and write down my feelings on the series as a whole.very loosely inspired by the history of the uk. ""game of thrones"" is a story about the powerful houses that battle or align to sit on the iron throne and rule the land of westeros. whilst these machinations take place, an ancient evil is rising in the extreme north, one that doesn't care for alliances or peace, one that will kill all to rule all.i loved it. really i did. i feel like ""game of thrones"" was the tv event of my lifetime, more than ""breaking bad"" or ""lost. each episode was an event, eventually managing to spend enough money to make some of it's battles rival the big screen for what tv can be. yes, i accept that they didn't stick the landing, once the series got ahead of the roadmap that the novels set for them, the quality does fall somewhat. nuance was sacrificed for speed and events that should have been organic felt rushed (even to some people a betrayal of the characters). but it's too easy to concentrate on those final moments and ignore how the series felt as a whole. it was a dangerous show. happy, eager even, to take a beloved character, even one with several seasons of ""plot armour"", as people call it, and end their story in a shocking moment , but not a shock for shocks sake, the action would the resonate with the remaining ones and feed their actions.it is the standard bearer now for effects and action on the small screen. battles that rival the ""lord of the rings"" series for scope and scale and three full sized dragons being just part of what the series had to offer. it's never been one for the squeamish though; the gore and violence levels are very high. the sexual scenes are also very prevalent in the earlier seasons although this does seem to fade away as the show runs on.honestly, if i hadn't seen ""game of thrones"" i would give the series a 10, it would be an unforgettable experience. a second walkthrough though would be interesting to do, i'm sure there's more foreshadowing than i was aware of, but also i'd know which characters aren't going to make it, so wouldn't invest the same time in them as before."
2021-06-15,lisafordeay,Good show but alot of nudity and gore,10,"game of thrones is a 2011 fantasy action tv series which ran for 6 seasons and it made the likes of emila clarke,jason momoa,richard madden,maise williams and sophia turner famous. its about a group of 9 people who are fighting against each other in order to control the mystical land of westeros.the cinematography is very good but my advice viewers should be advised and do not let younger ones watch this as there is full of sex,nudity,violence and of course gory e.g blood and beheading.if your a fan of lotr then you might like this. for me i thought it was ok but i wouldn't go crazy talking about it 24/7."
2013-03-09,benecumb,"Noble history, attitudes, and dreams in a nutshell",9,"this series has wittily aggregated ancient and medieval history of mankind , mostly focusing on aristocracy, but this is the history we know, through the eyes of wealthy and powerful people of those times. both the novelist and screenwriters have done a great job, creating a credible atmosphere and focusing on different ""ordinary"" persons, not powerful creatures with supernatural forces. of course, the viewers can recognize various books, sagas and epics of different times and nations, but references, patterns or profiles are not ""modernized"" copies too often available in the u.s. movies depicting ancient or medieval events. the other strength is the use of different filming locations in different countries, creating a real picture and avoiding intensive use of digital effects. viewers who have traveled in europe have nice joy of recognition. and of course, the cast - from several countries, including character actors from great britain, and giftedly chosen child actors. as for personal contribution, the most imposing to me were sean bean as ned stark, peter dinklage as turion (won golden globe for his performance) and nikolaj coaster-waldau as jaime lannister - a brit, an american, and a dane, respectively. but even smaller supporting roles were deliberated and well performed. as for the use of violence or erotica, i cannot agree with them who think it was unnecessary or too much; those thinking so are apparently not good at history :)for the sake of the best comprehension, you should see all the episodes and preferably more frequently than once a week. and it is better to have a graph of characters at hand as - throughout the series - there are several hundreds of them opening their mouth at least once, and most of the names and places are not easy to memorize either.anyway, i am looking forward to the season 3 already, although it seems that the weight of fantasy/magic increases."
2019-06-18,generationofswine,An Honest Review,7,"well, two thumbs up for the nudity, that holds my interests...honestly. i'm not ashamed to say it.and the acting was good.but i have a problem with fantasy. world building, world building, world building, world building, and that is coupled with gibberish, gibberish, gibberish, and, by the time it gets around to the thick, juicy, meat of the plot...it lost me.i really don't care about the world building, i'd rather jump right in to the plot and not deal with the nonsense. oh, they have wolves that aren't exactly wolves... i don't care. they have dragons, that's cool but... too much time was spent about why they are so rare and... i don't care, they have dragons, they are rare, just stop the world building and go back to the murder and intrigue.i honestly preferred rome, deadwood, the sopranos, all the other shows that didn't have to sacrifice so much to world building."
2019-05-20,robfollower,For better or worse Game of Thrones was an epic land mark series I enjoyed every season even if it did not end the way I personally wanted it to,2,"i don't understand the hate for this season, particularly the last few episodes. while i do agree that the ending was very rushed , if the showrunners were really so in love with the story, they should have taken time to better develop events - i think most of the last season was inevitable.dany was always more than a bit mad, and anyone who failed to notice that wasn't paying attention. she was never gracious when she didn't get what she wanted, and expected the love of the people of westeros as her gods-given birthright. when they didn't grant her that love, she acted as i'd expect.jon is jon, and he was never going to be king. not only did he not want it, he was singularly ill-suited for the job. and he always belonged in the north, not moping about in king's landing. in the end, tyrion found a way to free him.sansa will be a wonderful queen of the north. i've seen a lot of hate for her story line, that she was strengthened by her horrific experiences, but as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, it rings very true.arya, one of my most beloved characters, got the ending she deserved. the happiest moment in the finale gor me was watching her sail off to new adventures.and tyrion also got the ending he deserved. with bran on the throne, he is effectively ruling westeros - and he looks to be the best character for the job.i only wish they'd taken the time to get there in a way that didn't feel like they were in too much of a hurry to wrap things up."
2021-05-17,kevin_robbins,"Ultimately, this remains one of the greatest television series of all time, even with it's complete failure of a conclusion.",10,"game of thrones is a series we caught onto just after season 2 and watched real,time straight through after catching up off hbo until the very final episode. the storyline focuses on several kingdoms, many of which feel they have their own claim to the throne that rules them all. when a powerful and incestuous family takes the throne away from a recently killed king, some noble families emerge only to be ruthless struck down and family scattered. watch as the family members strive for success on their own and hope to get their lands back on the right foot and direction.the cinematography , special effects, costumes, writing, acting, character development and methodical execution of this series is all time great. the series seems to cut no corners of fulfillment, intensity, and unpredictability up until the final two seasons. as the vastness of this series begins heading towards its ultimate conclusion, characters started feeling...out of character, taking steps and directions that didn't make sense. the last two episodes seemed forced, as if they were trying to be overly clever instead of concluding in a format that made sense. even several scenes historically seemed to make no sense based on decisions made. ultimately, this remains one of the greatest television series of all time, so i had to score it a 10/10, even with it's complete failure of a conclusion. i strongly, strongly recommend seeing this."
2017-08-30,alindsay-al,An excellent season 7 that had me hooked from minute one,6,"game of thrones is easily the most popular show in the world right now and i have finally finished the seventh season of the show and this show is still top quality. the premise of the season sees the different entities of westeros trying to survive the winter. there are tons of characters on this show but in my opinion in this season the two man characters are jon snow played by kit harrington and daenerys targaryian played by emilia clarke. they are both great characters and you see the both of them develop this season and the show does a really good job showing them in unique lights that makes them more interesting. all the supporting cast is great, tryion, cersei and jaime lannister all have great moments this season that further enhance them as some of the best characters on any tv show. sansa and arya stark are given bigger roles this season and it works really well as there story develops in a very unique way that i wasn't expecting. i could go through every supporting character but i would be here all day so just know that the performances are top quality. the story this season is shorter then previous seasons but i really feel they did a good job of balancing the different story lines. i really enjoyed the development of the white walker storyline and i feel like that is really the end game for the show. i also feel the relationship story lines were handled a lot better this season. the script is great, the drama really works this season as more characters get reunited the tension does rise. but also for certain characters the humour was also really handled well. the style of the show has never been grander as the effects are incredible, the battle scenes are massive this season with the scale really delivering. because of the lower episode count this season is faster paced but you fall right in and it feels right. overall i really loved this season and can't wait for the next and last season."
2019-05-21,alindsay-al,A Fantastic Final Season for this amazing show,5,"game of thrones has been the biggest tv show of all time and now this eighth and final season has come and even though there has been a lot of division in my opinion this was just another fantastic season and a fitting end to this amazing spectacle of a show. the premise of the season sees daenarys & jon snow combine there forces in an attempt to take on the army of the dead, while cersei lannister prepares her forces for an attack from the dragon queen. now kit harington has sometimes been accused of being boring as jon snow but this season i thought his character was fantastic this season, he is dealing with keeping both daenarys and his family happy and worrying about the looming threat. harington uses his facial expressions brilliantly to show just how talented an actor he really is. emilia clarke as daenarys has always been great in the role but her character is given extra depth this season and she does a great job this season. her character gains more complexity this season and it is great to see a female character given this shine. the lannisters are back, first peter dinklage as tyrion lannister, now i will admit some of the writing for the character has been a bit mixed but dinklage's performance has been truly superb this season. he delivers such a good performance this season and you truly believe the trouble his character is going through. jamie lannister has been one of my favourite characters over the last few seasons and he is once again fantastic this season showing the development that he has gone through over the show. cersei lannister doesn't have as much of a screen presence this season but still is great as a central antagonist. their is the rest of a huge cast and they all do great jobs this season. the story moves at a quicker pace but i really liked the overarching theme of the season and the character interactions that take place. however, there are a few decisions taken at the end of the season that i didn't agree with and hurt the show a bit. the script is great, the drama is as strong as ever and the sprinkle of humour used really does make these characters more well rounded and feel like real people. the style of the show has never looked better, the cinematography is stunning this season and makes this the most visually stunning show of all time. overall this season of game of thrones is not the strongest of the show but is another fantastic addition. i have to say i have loved this show from the first episode to the last and i am glad that this show will go down in the history books and ends on a high."
2019-06-12,xweaponx,One small part of a larger story,10,"someone said, ""this series is not lord of the rings!"" , but they are wrong.this whole series is just a tiny fragment of the history of a world that contains westeros, essos, braavos, sothoryos, and ulthos. just like lord of the rings, which tells a very small piece of a story that goes all the way back to the silmarillion and well beyond lord of the rings and takes place across many different lands and in many languages, so too game of thrones.and that is why this show is exactly lord of the rings, not just because we are being told a tiny fragment of a much larger story and a much larger history. which is every bit as huge and complex as lotr, but because of the immensity and complexity of the world george rr martin created, which in some cases dwarfs lord of the rings.that is where the similarity ends. of course this is not middle earth or any ""earth"" whatsoever. the planet where westeros resides may as well be in the beta quadrant, and the uss discovery will visit it using their magic red angel time machine/spore drive in the next season of discovery. westeros resides in a world that appears to be inside-out, almost like a dyson sphere. we are shown this at the beginning of each episode with the unusual map that we see each time we enter this world. this world is unlike any other world we've seen in other ur-fantasy tales, it may as well be an alien planet.this is a meager part of a much longer and complex story.i say ""meager"", but when i first started watching this, and saw the scale of the locales and the believability and the truth of every location, i realized the scope of it all. even in lotr, you know that they are filming on earth. in this show, even the forests are unlike anything we've seen. there is no 800-foot wall of ice and magic on our earth. we can't even say ""hell"" because the concept of hell is not relatable to this world. this world has its own gods, and we must needs become familiar with them as the story goes on, before we can even use an expletive (other than sandor clegane's favourite word).and with lord of the rings, a song of ice and fire also has several languages that have been created from the ground up. in a unique move, whole blocks of dialogue were spoken in dothraki and high and low valyrian, causing us to enable subtitles for the first time ever just so we can understand what is being said. which i suppose is where the similarity to lotr finally and irrevocably ends, as they burned the subtitles into the scenes in that series of films.the final similarity to lord of the rings was in the narrative style, which has a complicated beginning and middle, but picks up speed for the last act, so that events are compressed into a few chapters. not being familiar with the book version of this show, i don't know how grrm will end it, but it is easier to elongate an ending on paper than it is to do so on film with a television budget.but even during the beginnings of this tale, which has satisfactory complexities, we realize the vastness of scope, even as we see the wall for the first time. or the vale of house arryn, later, we see the isle of pike and balon greyjoy's huge castle of 3 interlocking towers. also, many castles, bridges, cities, towers, and landmarks. old town and its citadel, which is as immense inside as it is outside. king's landing, and the sept of baelor. in the south as daenerys targaryen makes her way from east to west across essos, we see several walled cities like qarth, yunkai, astapor and meereen, each with a giant harpy on top of the largest pyramids. the house of the undying. and that's just essos, there are other continents on this world. and then see the full glory of dragonstone... oh, we got to see a few of its many rooms, its dungeon, and its night sky shape when it was occupied by stannis baratheon, but we really don't get to see it at all until season 7, in all of its uncanny majesty.and this is not even covering any of that story i was talking about. it begins thousands of years ago, when the children of the forest were fighting ""the first men"", and later there were other invasions, and eventually the doom of valyria, which brings us into the era where this part of the story begins.when hbo graciously offered me a month to catch up with this show, i did not hesitate. it didn't take long to get me hooked and i watched seasons 7 and 8 the same way everyone else did.but i am talking mostly about the landscape of westeros and the world it sits in, there is also the array of royal houses, each with their histories and conflicts and banners, much of this tale depends on histories that we only hear portions of in the show, mostly in passing conversations between the many characters. and if we did not pay attention, we missed it when it became relevant later.the characters are as complex as the landscape, and if we don't understand the history of westeros, we miss the total point of the conflicts between the various houses. and even those conflicts are inflated in scale beyond what we've ever seen before. we have invested so much time becoming involved with following those conflicts, the most important conflict is the one that is in the very first scene in the show that involves the three night's watch rangers. we see something odd happen there, we don't really fully understand it until much later in the show, and the scale of that conflict makes the struggle for whoever is going to sit on the iron throne, trivial at best. this was shy i was shocked by the events of season 7. as i went back and revisited the seasons before that, there were hints about what was to come peppered throughout episodes all the way back to season 1. they are hidden within what we would dismiss as filler conversation between characters, and if we were lucky, we'd remember a vision that someone saw or a passing comment about things that were stored underneath kings landing.i don't really have any complaints about the way these events were played out, i have a lot of respect for the detail; things that i thought were cgi ended up not being cgi at all, but clever compositing of real elements. and when your base of characters shrinks from almost 100 down to about 20 or so, you can't really continue a narrative style that involved those 100 characters.not having read the books, i was glad to have an element of surprise. every season handed me something that never failed to knock me off my couch, and provided a visual and auditory smorgasbord at the same time.i am really going to miss that."

2019-08-13,cjonesas,"Despite the 9/10, a wonderful series has been ruined in the end",10,"consistency and quality are keys to success.the quality was always there in the series, even in the last two seasons, but the show dropped in consistency and logic, storyline and subsequently the characters' actions and play.the rush and overall inconsistencies were visible in season 7, but they became blatant in season 8.what was the reason.. i will never know..what i do know is that they built an epic and fantastic journey for 8 years, just to bulldozer it in the last season. a too short of a season, despite the 70,80 minutes long episodes.
the result are clear to everyone. dissatisfaction and a bitter taste in the mouth.due to the above, my ratings of 10/10 is lowered to 9/10, because in my opinion, the series still deserves praise and acclaim as one of the best and epic series of all time.and please do not compare got with breaking bad. the series have nothing in common besides awesomeness in their own genre with superb story, actors and play in both of them."
2011-07-16,3xhcch,Those Shocking Episode Endings Rule!,8,"i have not seen a complete hbo series before. a colleague convinced me to try ""game of thrones."" i did watch the first episode and never looked back. over the past days, i watched one episode a day until i completed all 10 episodes of the first season. it was that good. you'd never want to be kept hanging.the series brings us back to a medieval time with kings and queens, lords and ladies. it showed things as they probably were back then, grimy, rough and violent. there was very little of the glitz and glamor that mark modern royalty nowadays. it shows the political intrigues of the aristocracy, as well as their advisers, whores and knights behind them. it is also about family. the central family were the starks. eddard was picked by his good friend king robert (family baratheon) to be his hand (or executive officer). this threw the stark family (wife, five kids and one bastard) into the political fray after after their long quiet existence in the north. there is also the lannister family of the queen cersei (a nebulously sinister lena headey), constantly waiting for an opportunity to grab power. and finally, the very blond targaryen family who ruled the realm before robert, now down to their last two members, the crazy viserys (harry lloyd) and his meek sister daenerys (emilia clarke).as you can envision, the action in the battles, sword fights, and jousting scenes were very graphic and bloody. we were not spared the sight of gushing severed arteries, festering wounds, impaled heads and animal attacks. this is definitely not for the faint of heart! you can just look away and the sound effects do just as well to convey the gore on screen. on the other end of the rated ma spectrum are the occasional sex scenes with both female and male members on display. these may be called gratuitous for tv, but i do gather these are also part of the books. nevertheless, the sight of a 10,year old boy breastfeeding from his mother was still very disturbing, even in these days.for someone who had not yet read the books, the way the story was written for tv and the directorial execution were very good. the ending scene of the first episode alone will make you want to be back for more. love those endings for most episodes, aside from episode 1, those of 7 and 9 will really shock you! there are things that happen that you would never predict. the fates of the characters were very unpredictable up to the very last episode. the ending of the last episode gives the series another dimension, whetting our appetite for the next season.the writing may be archaic in vocabulary and construction, but yet they are crisp and witty, especially those that uttered by the dwarf tyrion lannister (peter dinklage in his emmy-nominated role). the set design of the the throne room, the dungeons that open into cliffs, the war camps were excellent. the cinematography was sweeping when it needs to be majestic, and intimate where it was necessary to be claustrophobic. i did not know most of the actors here, but they will affect you as they portray their characters were portrayed, be it hero, villain or double-agent. aside from bean, headey and dinklage, special mention go to michelle fairley (as eddard's strong wife catelyn), nikolaj coaster- waldau (as the rogue jamie lannister) and jason momoa (as the imposing khal drogo).this show deserves its emmy nomination for best drama. definitely, i will be back to watch the second season. i will also be reading the novels by george rr martin that inspired this sweeping epic series."
2015-03-03,s3276169,Convincing sword and sorcery franchise,1,"game of thrones dodges the title of just another sword and sorcery franchise.it does so primarily by refusing to believe in heroes. there are no characters who are beyond harm or human failings. everyone in this series has their strengths and weaknesses.its this sense of reality that balances and makes plausible the otherworldly aspects of the series, such as magic and dragons. the acting is in many cases excellent too, with a strong cast who know their craft. that said, at times the medieval cruelty is a little hard to take. it often feels too, as if the medieval torture is used as a vehicle to inject a sense of realism into the franchise. what it does instead, is become distasteful and tiresome. just as tiring is the rather drawn out and predictable story lines that, in and of themselves, are not too different to any other found in this genre. for me game of thrones is different but only just manages to stand out from the crowd. its popular but then series of this kind tap into a genre with a strong, well established tradition and following. for me however, this fact doesn't justify elevating the series to the lofty status many other reviewers have given it. seven out of ten from me."

2012-06-03,ctomvelu1,For a certain audience,5,"1. i do not care for fantasy. 2. i despise hbo. having gotten those two caveats out of the way, i was recently subjected to the first five episodes of this hbo series. i found it talky, flatly directed and under,budgeted, which is nothing new with tv series or miniseries. at the same time, i was surprised by the quality of some of the acting, especially lena headley, peter dinklage and sean bean, and the cinematography, which brought this alternate universe world to life. i also understand the script adheres fairly closely to the book, probably because the author was responsible for translating it to the screen. from what i saw of it, i would warn prospective viewers not to expect another lord of the rings. it reminded me more of dune. as with so many hbo shows, there's some gratuitous sex and nudity, including truly repulsive scenes where a 10 year old boy suckles at his mother's teat and an effeminate man performs fellatio. there's also some gore and violence, although not enough for this gore-and-violence fan. i understand some of the worst cruelty in the book has been eliminated. thank god for small favors. this show is for adult fantasy fans and those who like to be titillated, like the individual who made me sit through the first five episodes. at times, it verges on the pornographic."
2020-02-13,invisibleunicornninja,Not as good as people claim,8,"this show has way too many characters, and it shows. i watched seasons 1,6 and they were ok. from what i've heard about them, i'm going to skip seasons 7-8. there is a lot of stupid stuff throughout the course of the show, and it really builds up to massive disastrous moments towards the end of season 6. if it gets even worse - i do not want to watch that.edit - my mom made me finish the show. it was so bad. i'm changing my rating from a 7/10 to a 5/10. there are no words i can use to describe this show that will not make my review be taken down by imdb. this show is barely worth watching for the good scenes. like maybe 30% of this show overall is worth watching and has satisfying payoffs. so much of it is so bad."
2017-07-02,justin-fencsak,The greatest TV show of all time!!!,5,"when game of thrones first came out in 2011, i was the first to pay for hbo when it came with my fios ultimate package and have never missed an episode since thanks to dvr and on demand showings of the show. sometimes i even fall asleep watching it first run and watch it again. the show is one of the best on tv, being better than any movie blockbuster out there. the first few seasons are based on the best selling books by george r.r. martin, with future seasons borrowing elements from the last few and upcoming books. it's a shame that this season and the next, which will air in 2019, will be short yet satisfying. game of thrones is to hbo what the walking dead and breaking bad is to amc and the west wing is to nbc; great television that will be talked about in the water,cooler for years to come. winter has been here for seven and eight seasons and will last forever."
2011-05-16,rob_taylor,It made me go out and buy the books!,10,"and the above comment is high praise indeed from me. see, i had heard of the song of ice and fire books, but most of what i'd heard about them focused on the ""political machination"". so, not being a terrible fan of politics, i gave them a miss, thinking they might be dry and dull.then along comes hbo's serialization.....and i'm hooked! first episode has the promise of more traditional fantasy tropes in the form of undead monsters, along with the most impressive opening credits scene to any show i've watched. to summarize, the credits show you the world of game of thrones, with the important areas paused on and expanded. basically, a camera fly,over of the world. it sounds a lot less impressive than it actually is.then the story begins. at this point in the first episode i knew absolutely nothing about the setting or characters. however, despite the depth of the setting, i never felt like i was lost, or that i had no idea who was who or what was going on. it explained enough to keep me happy, but did not try and deluge me with information.there is also an energy to the series that was infectious. although there are (as yet) no major action set-pieces, the show moves along very smartly, feeling neither rushed nor dragging. and the ending of the first show pretty much guarantees the viewer will tune in next week! so it was with me, anyway. not only that, but after the second show, i ordered the first of george rr martins ice and fire novels. i felt there was more that i could know about certain things that weren't really explained well (such as the tree in the opening credits), and not just could know, but wanted to know.i've now read the first two novels, and have the third to hand. i'm very much impressed by how faithfully the series has adhered to the novels. yes, there are occasional scenes missing or added, usually to streamline the information flow, but all the characters are there and the plot is, so far, 99% identical to the books.also impressive, is how adult the series is. the novels never skimp from showing the brutality and sordidness of mediaeval life and neither does the show. i've just watched episode five and the ""breastfeeding"" scene (which i was sure would not make it into the show having read the book) and it is very creepy to see.as for sets they've not skimped on location shooting, nor have they shied away from other effects. the landscapes are sometimes startling, and the combat effects are gruesome rather than gory.acting all around is superb, especially given some of the scenes the characters have to act out. a particular favourite is peter dinklage who plays tyrion (perhaps my favourite character from the books) with such wit and dry humour that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role.if there is any criticism i can level at the show so far it is that some of the characters have had their motivations telegraphed a little too much so far. but it is a different medium from the novels and the audience does need to know who to root for to a certain extent as there are so many characters.all in all, i'm very impressed with the show and hope that it continues for a long time. i know the second season has already been ordered (presumably following the second novel's story, which will be a riot!) but i'm already hoping for a third season. the show is that good.i don't know how much money hbo have spent on the show, but it does show. there are no hercules costumes here.if lord of the rings is the epitome of fantasy movies, then so far, game of thrones is the epitome of fantasy serialisation."
2020-12-20,qui_j,"The most ""over-hyped"" TV show .....ever!",7,"this is a tough slog for someone who ""binge watches"". the show seems to revolve around a lot of gratuitous violence, swearing, and soft porn. the characters are fairly unlikable and annoying, especially the john snow character. it was amazing that he was not written out of the series early on. the special effects and cgis are pretty amazing but a ridiculous plot and some rubbish made up languages just don't make it a hit. to be fair however, it was remarkable to see that the actors did not laugh when they had to be saying the lines in gibberish!main characters are killed off on a fairly regular basis to make room for new ones (since there were so many novels to go through) that it's impossible to keep up without using a spreadsheet. this is great for the acting industry as it did create a lot of jobs! it also works for people who become fatigued by season 4 and wish the whole cast were dead. the plot does not disappoint in this regard as people are killed off with ruthless regularity! because a whole fantasy universe was created for the series, it does hold tremendous appeal for people who find dragons and monsters cool! for others, it really is just a tedious, forgettable and boring slog!"
2019-12-22,mhorg2018,A final review,9,"originally, after the thrilling season 1, i was going to edit my review after every season, but i decided to wait until the disappointing and rushed ending. overall, it was a decent show, but like the books it's based on, which got thicker and needed more editing as they went on, this show got shorter and more rushed. i'd put the blame for this on hbo and george martin, who spent so much time f,--ing off, writing things that didn't help finish his tale, that the writers were caught with their pants down. the first five seasons were the best, the sixth was decent, the last two rushed. there was a lot of logic lost, but if you watch and read the books, there wasn't a lot of logic there. in the books dani sits in a fire and births the dragons, yet later, she gets burned. ignoring this for the series was a good idea. but the magic is inconsistent, as is the action. in one episode a dragon is killed by ballista, leaving one. in the next, one dragon lays waste to kings landing with nary a scratch on it or danyers. so overall, this was a decent, but not great series. there are only a few episodes i'd rewatch and most of them revolve around arya."
2019-07-11,nancyldraper,A Watershed Moment for Television,8,"it is not by oversight that i have not written a review of this series, before today. i was a late adopter, having been initially repulsed by the lasiviousness, lewd, violent coarseness of the show (i think i watched one random episode and recoiled). then, when the popularity of the show skyrocked, my curiousity lead me to start at the beginning and give the show a chance. i binged what i'd missed, then watched it episodically as it was broadcast, then, just before the beginning of each new season, i would binge the previous season, just to be caught up and ready to go. all those things that originally repelled me where still all there in abundance but the story telling, the characters, the acting, the quality of the production, and the human drama, on an epic scale, held my fascination and it became a guilty pleasure (so, watching, but not reviewing). then, the production overshot the source material and the direction became less crisp and the characters struggled to find their footing. finally, the end was near, and production values soared to movie,of-the-week standards. the last season ended and the audience was stunned. some with disappointment (wounded by the trajectory of the plot and their beloved characters). some with grief (no more game of thrones!?!). some with sense overload (what did i just see?!?). i was in that category. it took days to reconcile what i had just watched. my only clear thought was, ""well...they had to end it some way."" i was sure they could not have ended it in a way that would have satisfied everyone. is there ever a good time/way to watch a beloved thing die? so, now, 53 days after the last episode was broadcast, i am summoning up the courage to write my review. this was a landmark series. it set the bar for non-network television productions: the story, acting, technical magic, locations, international cast, budget, quality were all the best of the best. for me, it will always be about story and characters: george r.r. martin's concepts were epic and compelling; i can't imagine a better cast or better performances (indeed they harvested from some of the greatest while also forging a new generation of talent). no matter where you land with the ending (and i'm still not sure how i feel about it) this has been a tremendous ride and it has change our landscape of expectations. i can give this series no less than a 10 (watershed moment) out of 10. {epic fantasy action adventure drama}"
2020-06-23,abdulxoxo,"Epic beginning, disastrous ending...",10,"season 1 to 4 are the best, 5 to 6 are a bit slow. ending of season 6 was excellent, they didn't utilize it in season 7. season 7 to 8 that's where the problem comes in, it's rushed and once beloved characters are turned to teribble characters. we deserved a better ending than this."
2017-01-14,susiesalmonlikethefish,"So, that Videodrome film was right...",7,"first of all, this is only my opinion, you don't have to agree. but i find game of thrones to be the most pretentious, sadistic, boring and perverted show on earth. first off, its medieval setting is incredibly cliché. why do all fantasy things seem to take place in what resembles medieval europe? this has been way overdone in the genre. and then there's the cruelty in the show. i love horror films, i love crime thrillers, but in game of thrones the frequent violence is so nonchalant that it's like a sociopath created a television program or something! of course the rise of nerd culture is likely what is making this bizarre show so popular. all it is though is violence, boring archaic dialogue and of course, sex constantly. sex without love, basically s/m porn for tv. some viewers probably get off on it. it's disgusting, like watching a snuff film broadcast into my house. i no longer watch the show and have no plans to continue wasting my time with it. people praise it for its ""political concepts"" and ""well,developed characters"" and yet the show follows every fantasy trope and its only edge is death and violent sex for shock value. the whole show seems to exist largely just so its creators can push boundaries by throwing in all kinds of psychotic garbage just to see if they can pull it off and get away with it all. i know the books were violent but never to this extent. terrible show in my opinion and however the hell it got such a high rating is absolutely beyond me."
2015-08-23,johnny-the-film-sentinel-2187,Game of Thrones is more than just a television show.,1,"george r.r. martin's magnum opus, a song of ice and fire, has been adapted into one of the finest television shows in recent memory and is quickly and easily pushing the boundaries of television production and its own network, hbo. like most hbo productions, the stories are like film serials that show us stories that would be too much for any single 2,hour movie to tell. game of thrones is a world-encompassing epic of heroes, anti-heroes, magic, bastards and dragons, and the best dwarf on television: tyrion lannister.if i were to put to words how to describe this magnificent show, i would say just this one: grand! everything about game of thrones is masterfully done with hardly any fault. the world of westeros is incredibly dense and not full of your black-and-white locations in a typical television drama; many of the places are different, sharing their own beauties and terrors, like the wall, and king's landing. the same traits can also be said about this show's cast of characters, which is still an ever- growing plethora of protagonists and antagonists to root for or against them. yet even with this ever-growing patch, you realise in the end that they're all still inhabiting the same world, like a true epic fantasy story does so wonderfully.game of thrones is the show of the generation, the magnum opus of the small screen and an unsurpassed world-builder."
2015-04-23,antoniotierno,perfectly cast and carrying a high production value,1,"the storyline feels like something you need a wikipedia page to follow. it's the stuff of fantasy geek heaven, i.e.a strongly gritty period drama with letter,perfect clothes, weapons and lingo, yet unencumbered by historical facts or the weight of real events. of all the sword- flinging series which are on tv right now, game of thrones is by far the best – cloaking a clever commentary on modern day political conniving with a gray medieval-age story which feels like rings' older, sexed-up brother. the main accomplishment of game of thrones is in that, while it should keep the hard-core fans satisfied, even viewers who don't care if theon is a greyjoy or a tully can have a good time."
2017-10-02,miguelneto-74936,Game of Thrones is more than a series of Dragons as many people describe,8,"game of thrones is undoubtedly the most popular series of today, a super production of hbo based on the fantasy books of george martin, the series has 7 season and probably the 8 and last will come out in 2019, game of thrones is a series that had its ups and downs, but it is undeniable that each season had at least one great episode, season 5 for example i consider the weakest in the series, was in my opinion much lower until episode 7, but we had 3 great final episodes which made the season stay above average, season 1 is in my opinion the best season of the series, is the one that had a better sequences, with 10 great episodes, highlight for the episode baelor that shocked everyone who saw and showed that in game of thrones there is no one safe, the series has evolved a lot in terms of production, had incredible scales, the season 6 has the sensational episode battle of bastards that is incredible, had great vilans, in the case king joffrey and ramsey, the 7 season was very critical, i did not find it weak as they say, even with some problematic episode, the series knows how to shock the audience, the episode the rains of castamere, game of thrones also has many scenes spicy, the soundtrack is great ned stark, jon snow, cersei, jamie and etc, game of thrones is a great series, so far in its 7 seasons even with some problems, had all the seasons above average, i hope the 8 finish the series in style. note 90note for season 1 season , 97 2 season - 91 3 season - 89 4 season - 93 5 season - 84 6 season - 86 7 season - 88best episodes 1 - battle of the bastards 2 - hardhome 3 - baelor 4 - the spoils of war 5 - winter is coming"
2011-05-13,sarastro7,No classic...,10,"after four episodes, i have to say that i am disappointed. it's not that too much is happening , i love my entertainment to be packed with storytelling - it's more that every single thing that happens, and the way everything is done, is utterly cliché, and seems cobbled together from dozens of other works. the impetus of the story is shock value and soap opera, sex scenes that convey obviously conservative values (as per what we're supposed to be shocked about), characters who act idiotically, and stupid-looking hair-colors. this does not say ""timeless quality"" to me.there is some entertainment value here, but not enough to make it really interesting. the show has two assets: peter dinklage and maisie williams. well, and sean bean. and, i guess, the guy who plays the bastard, although he, too, is terribly cliché. oooh, the wronged bastard who is really a super-nice guy and worthy heir... sheesh. anyway, i felt like i recognized maisie williams from somewhere, but it dawned on me that she just resembles james mcavoy quite enormously... funny.anyway, i don't expect this show to keep my (very critical, i admit) interest for much longer, as it will probably never rise from its swamp of soapiness and into truly epic territory. i will say, though, that i'm impressed and amused with the way hbo always makes use of almost exclusively british acting talent when they want to make sure the cast and the voice acting are of a properly excellent caliber. cheaper and better in one fell swoop, no doubt. so, i guess the u.s. still needs the ol' country now and again when quality is at the stake...6 stars out of 10."
2012-02-09,andy-296,"Great entertainment, though it falls somewhat short of being a Masterpiece",9,"this hbo series, somewhat reminiscent of the lords of the ring in plot and style, is based on the popular medieval fantasy books by george martin (not the beatles producer) and is basically about the struggle for power in the mythical seven kingdoms between two families, the evil lannisters headed by the wife of the king, queen cersei (a fine performance by lena headey) and the more honorable starks, who rule in the north of the realm, led by ned stark (a good turn as well by sean bean). there is a third dynasty as well, the targaryen, related to the previous, murdered king, whose two survivors are the evil, bleach blond viserys (a magnetic harry lloyd) and his beautiful, ethereal sister daenerys (the petite emilia clarke, a revelation in a stunning performance). they live in exile among the savage dothraki, a race of brutal, nomadic horse riders, and viserys hope that the marriage of daenerys with their leader khal drogo will help him raise an army of dothraki to invade the seven kingdoms, overthrow the king and put him in charge of the seven kingdoms.the series benefits from some great performances. besides those i just mentioned, i have to add peter dinklage as the sardonic dwarf tyrion lannister, brother to the queen, and jack gleeson as the insufferable, cruel child heir to the throne, joffrey. not all performances in the series are remarkable, though: most of the starks, especially ned's sons, fail to make much of an impression.the series has a very good start, then somewhat loses steam in the middle episodes, but rises again in the last two chapters for a rousing finale. i quite enjoyed the series, but i cannot call it a masterpiece. one problem that the many characters and the various, convoluted plots make it confusing at times. some plot threads, especially the one in the frontier, could have been excised completely and the series would not have suffered. the stunning photography and locations certainly helps."
2021-02-25,drjgardner,Why????????????,1,"i'm sure there is a reason why this marvelous series turned to s*it in the final season and especially the final 3 episodes. worst of all was the writing, followed by poor direction. you can even tell by the acting that the actors were as disappointed as the fans were having to keep up with this dribble. i won't elaborate because i don't want to reveal plot points, but here are some criticisms that won't reveal much.dramas lead up to a confrontation between the hero (es) and the villain (s) and usually the worst or most powerful villain is saved for last.usually a character displays his/her intelligence and it maintains itself unless there is a change. a clever person doesn't become a moron one day.for a satisfactory ending the villain should be vanquished by the hero, not by events or circumstances.unless you're watching a 30s serial, when you kill of a character they stay dead and don't appear a few scenes later.thank goodness for all the marvelous seasons, but the people responsible for the last season should be permanently banned."
2013-03-29,partialmovieviewer,Hands off the Royal Set,10,"i started watching, 'the game of thongs – ah – thrones', after we managed to get a hold of a case full of dvds covering previous boobsshows. at first, i felt the only reason for producing this program was to display young medieval boobs, so i just had to watch the first episode all the way to the end. after watching the first show, my inclination was that there was no plot, yet digging deeper between the cleavages, i discovered a very intriguing boobplot. i discovered there were only a few sets of important boobs, the rest were only clever viewer distractions, i will call these , diversionary boobs. oh, and i will admit, i was taken in by this ploy. let's face it, there were big boobs, little boobs and even middle-of-the-road boobsit was like being lost in a vast forest of boobs - how was i to know which were important and which were not? one day my head was spinning trying to figure things out and then it hit me. i noticed that there was a set of royal boobs soaking in milk. this was that eureka moment for me. it was apparent that these two stars were attached to some queen or some sub-queen or something. in any case, i knew these boobs were important. i recognized these as the controlling boobs. one would say they might be nestled in the protective confines of the royal bra. envy and jealousy forced several sub-boobs into squabbling battles and dangerous alliances - some of which are successful and some are not. all these actions have the endgame goal of wrestling the royal boobs from their protective cups and placing one set of sub-boobs into ultimate control. i kid - truthfullythis is a well directed show and it is very entertaining. the acting is superb with a story that is so intense and spellbindingthe viewer will soon becomes entrenched with all the characters. i will admit, i did not like the show at firsti was such a boob. i am hooked and am now a fan. so – folks – keep up the excellent work."
2020-06-22,petra_ste,Post-mortem,10,"i liked game of thrones. really, really liked it. it got me into martin's still unfinished but excellent book series. now that game of thrones is over and the winds of winter still hasn't come out, here's a brief autopsy of the show.so, what killed it? writing, after season four. everything else was wonderful: visuals, special effects, costumes, the soundtrack by ramin djawadi.acting was amazing, with special mentions to sean bean, mark addy, charles dance, lena headey, pedro pascal, conleth hill, stephen dillane (even if stannis was butchered), liam cunningham and peter dinklage , the latter was fantastic as tyrion before the character was written in the last seasons first as a quip-delivering machine, then as a wet blanket and an idiot.but really, everyone was great, with initially unknown leads kit harrington and emilia clarke growing nicely into their roles and revelatory performances like alfie allen's and maisie williams' (who was stellar before arya's transmogrification into a smug psycho). one of the best acted shows ever, no doubt.seasons one, two and three were mostly superb, bringing martin's detailed fantasy world and complex characters to life. best episodes: 1x05, 1x07, 1x08, 1x09, 2x03, 2x08, 2x09, 3x05, 3x07, 3x09.season four showed the first cracks (like the awful jaime/cersei sept scene) but was still generally great. sadly, the show died more or less when tywin lannister did. best episodes: 4x02, 4x08, 4x09. worst episodes: 4x03, 4x05.season five was the beginning of the end - not coincidentally, that's when show writers benioff and weiss started running out of book material to adapt. sure, there was the occasional visually luscious battle episode (5x08, and later 6x09, 7x04...), but i maintain that stuff like the farcical dorne storyline, the character assassination of stannis and the abominable sansa/ramsay subplot were as bad as anything in seasons 7-8. best episode: 5x08. worst episodes: 5x06, 5x09.season six was marginally better but another major issue emerged: for a series where supposedly ""nobody is safe"", the obscene amount of plot armor displayed by some characters became incredibly jarring. best episodes: 6x05, 6x09. worst episodes: 6x07, 6x08.in season seven the direwolf was out of the bag: many viewers realized the pacing was rushed and some plotlines were absurd (the wight hunt, dany's war strategy). best episode: 7x04. worst episode: 7x06.season eight (best episodes: 8x02, worst episodes: all the others) of the once most beloved show on television was received as well as an invasion of plague rats. it was clear to most fans at that point that the writers did not care about: 1) details - for example, distances, so important in a world full of geographical barriers affecting journeys, were totally ignored, with characters teleporting all around the map in the span of a single episode; 2) themes (they had been misinterpreting martin's ""romantic realism"" for garden-variety nihilism for years); 3) coherent character arcs.in fact, when a protagonist did get something resembling a thematically sound character arc (i.e. theon), it felt almost jarring compared to the haphazard development of nearly everyone else who survived after season four (the worst being poor jaime).final verdict: seasons 1, 2 and 3: 9/10;
season 4: 8/10;
season 5: 4/10;
season 6: 5/10;
season 7: 4/10;
season 8: 3/10"

2016-04-24,swilliky,My favorite show is back for season six!,3,"catching up with the multitude of character both alive in dead where we left in season 5 leads to a bunch of short segments that inform of where most of the characters are at the beginning of this new sixth season. the story picks up with the most pertinent mystery of jon snow's death. the show does not give into the rumor mill, so far kit harington only plays a corpse, and tell us whether he will come back now or ever. i was a bit worried that he would rise from the dead as a white walker. the show moves from their to the other north residents including the boltons who are still scheming for the throne but have a problem with a now missing sansa stark, played by sophie turner. her situation looks dire until brienne of tarth, played by the increasingly popular gwendoline christie, shows up to finally fulfill her promise to catelyn stark.after the sixth season: game of thrones is the greatest show on television flying high above some very healthy competition because it never fails to raise the stakes and creates a world that viewers can dive into. the twists were numerous and totally unexpected despite the spoiler atmosphere of the internet. this hbo show based on the novel by george r. r. martin has shown the potential of fantasy and set a high watermark for what television hopes to achieve.this sixth season began with many of the characters either in dire situations or recovering from a trauma. after the 7th season: the penultimate season of my favorite show on television offered plenty of tense action scenes with breathtaking action spectacle while also setting up the final season. jon snow (kit harington) recovers from his encounter with the bolton bastard and gathers his force in winterfell with the help of sansa stark (sophie turner). cersei lannister (lena headey) garners her forces in king's landing with her lover and brother jaimie lannister (nikolaj coaster,waldau). daenerys targaryen (emilia clarke) lands in dragonstone with her hand tyrion lannister (peter dinklage) and others advisors. she prepares for war with tyrion counsel but is undercut by the villainous euron greyjoy (pilou asbæk) and his iron fleet. arya stark (maisie williams) gets revenge on the murderers of her family and heads home to winterfell. the seven episodes had characters traveling fast and things moving a little quicker but better special effects that were outstanding, especially the dragons and undead white walker.the ultimate threat is the white walker led by the ruthless night king. jon knows that he will have to rally the forces and convince the two queens to make a truce to fight the greater threat. tyrion cautions daenerys against attacked king's landing in an all-out assault because later she would have to rule but in the process, he loses two territories that allied with the dragon queen, highgarden and dorne. euron confronts his nephew theon greyjoy (alfie allen) and captures his niece yara greyjoy (gemma whelan) while also killing the sandsnakes. jon snow heads south to request help from daenerys. samwell tarly (john bradley) has gone to train at oldtown but this means cleaning bed pans and treating jorah mormont (iain glen) for his greyscale illness. check out more of this recap and others at swilliky.com"
2019-05-20,allanmichael30,Hot and cold but hiped up to level 11 out of 10,10,"this series was like a souflee full of hot air, once it finnaly got to last episode it started to deflate fast. it was stupid and after the killing of white walkers the story become a parady with bad diologe, story seemed rushed. tyrion was the star of show and should have had his moment to kill queen. the dragons were just stupid and never really did what i thought they could have done. i always through tyrion could have been a targarian and maybe john snows older half brother. the end got more political than i was hoping and rather stupid as dothraki and the grey worm the unsullied leader seemed to do nothing when his queen was killed and john snow was arrested and put in jail but not show being captured or givin himself up. the unsullied and dothraki seem to show no mercy to the people of kingslanding so why did they still stay in a packed with other leaders and not kill john and tyrion. plus they could now make another season as sansa stark still looks like shes hungry for power."
2018-11-11,silvermistvio,What's the point? All I can see is the show is all about having sex.,5,"this is the only tv show which i stopped watching after i watched an episode. this tv show clearly shows that how americans are into sex thing. i mean you can write a lot of good things that are better than sex. why do you want this in the show? it's so gross. (especially when you're eating. i can't even imagine.) it's like watching a blue screen film. so, i stopped watching after an episode.i just wish they didn't add those sex scenes into the show. if they didn't, i might give at least five stars."
2019-08-29,silvermistvio,This show is totally unbearable.,6,"i don't know why a lot of people like this tv show. i tried to watch it, but before the first episode finished, i had to stop watching. the show is full of blue scenes. all those naked and sex scenes are the worst of all in this show. it's so unbearable.it might be a great show for the others, but as for me, it's totally a garbage. so sorry to say that."
2014-05-14,petarmatic,This review was deleted but I am not sure why.,6,"i would like to know why this review was deleted? i was not shocked when i learned that they are going to shoot game of thrones in dubrovnik. but for dubrovnik to be the king*s landing a.k.a london, that was unfair. for london of course! dubrovnik is such a backwater and a province! it is very beautiful, and interesting for film shooting since they repaired it, since it was largely destroyed by the serbs and montengrins in 1991. but it is a small town with a provincial feel. what in the earth did i do there for 10 years???!!!??? well at least kids grew up, but i will never forgive what they did to my children especially theodore in ivana gundulića school. why were they aggressive towards them? because they were american born? svata!!! dubrovnikians sometimes felt like the orks. very aggressive and nationalistic. albeit dubrovnik is beautiful like a gem! the whole dubrovnik,neretva county is like a gem. i hope the scouting people of the game of thrones will find popovići beach and do couple of shots there. i even tried to be an extra in the series by they did not pick me. they did pick my neighbour and he was given 50euros for three days of shooting.as far as the series goes, i had a feeling that i watched something similar in like lord of the rings films. it is unavoidable that someone was going to spread those films into series. it is fun to watch, for we will have some more seasons. but i think i outgrew it, it is for the kids. all the actors are so good but emilia clarke and peter dinklage carry the whole series. special effects are great, the naval siege of the king*s landing is fantastic and dubrovnik walls became useful for the first time in its history, dubrovnik was never sieged, except in its very early history, the walls you see today never were used to defend dubrovnik, it was deemed to unimportant by both the turks and the venice.i think that 9,4 grade is too high to mark the series, given on imdb.com page. i gave it 7 out of 10. and please do not come to dubrovnik to check out the locations. from your bodies we can not walk freely on dubrovnik streets.above lines were written after watching three seasons. i wanted to add a little bit more after season four.i have to say it was more interesting to watch season four, it became more serious and everything jumped for a notch, acting, plot, visual and special effects. i especially enjoy acting by emilia clarke. man she really portrays deep savagery of her character, i have a need to do her in a local wc on lokrum island, if you get my drift...i will raise my grade from 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10. just as i said, everything became better in season four. i have to say i am looking forward watching season five and beyond, i am interested which parts of dubrovnik did they use for sets, although i do not like dubrovnikians, i love dubrovnik*s geography. it really is one of the rare gems of beauty in the world..."
2019-03-11,darkside-reviewer,One realm to rule over all,3,game of thrones is a truly memorable and amazing fantasy epic the story complex and thought provoking the battles bloody and hard fought that does not shy away from graphic violence the lore gets more intriguing with each book and episode released even if your not one for fantasy this show will have something you will love i recommend giving this show a watch it's world will not disappoint the actors truly bring this world of fantasy alive every actor is that there very best here even the extras give it 100% no amateur hour acting to be seen anywhere there's also graphic nudity and sex scene's which are done professionally and only adds to shows commitment to give you a genuine experience of this epic fantasy world.
2014-03-01,shopaholic35,An exceptionally good show that lives up to the hype.,1,"wow this really is an exceptional show. i wasn't sure if it was going to be able to live up to the hype but it far exceeded my expectations. my initial thoughts were that maybe people loved it because of all the sex scenes or maybe it was excessively violent, well it has both but it contributes to the storyline in a way that enforces the barbaric nature of a time long ago. everything they have done feels calculated and necessary to tell the story properly.game of thrones feels like a cross between lord of the rings and the tudors. it is situated in a fantasy world and a historical period drama. the production quality feels like a big budget movie and they have assembled a team who seem to genuinely care about creating a quality show. out of all the actors, peter dinklage is my favourite. he is great in his role and steals the scene from his other cast members. on the other end of the scale i hate the evil b!tch they call a queen and the snivelling prince sh!ts me off. why does power always have to go to some people's heads. (i'm only 6 episodes in so my opinion could change)at this point i am very happy with the direction of the show and look forward to many more seasons. i may even decide to read the books as i can't help but want more of games of thrones."
2017-08-02,bababooe,"Mindless nonsense! Crappy story, acting/dialogue, graphics. Nice costumes, scenery and music. Admit it, it's crap.",1,"ok, i didn't start watching this until earlier this year. i haven't seen all the episodes. but i have seen most. i was interested in where all these characters relate to each other, and what the hell is going on. now that the new season has started, i know where all this crap is going and where the characters relate. i will finish watching, because i have nothing better to do. the main problem here is the story, screenplay, plot, dialogue. it sucks. it's boring. it's a freaking daytime soap opera with killings, and the soap opera part and the killings are not that good. so, what's left. not much. the acting is horrible for the most part. there are a handful of decent actors, with decent dialogue. most of these actors suck. the dialogue is terrible all around. but still a good actor can make, as they say, reading the newspaper or the yellow pages sound good. these actors are not even b rate, they are c or z rate. thanks for nothing. one more thing. what's up with all the british accents? most of the older sword and sandals movies had british actors, like the roman or egyptian, alexander the great, persian, greek, whatever, and that sucked too. but why the hell is game of turds using british accents. did the british visit this planet at some point in time? it's cheese. it's cheap. it's easy. no thought involved. some freaking genius writer on the show said, yeah give them all british accents. that's it. the opening music is good. very catchy. not great, like i'm heading out to buy the cd, but good. i suspect without this tune, this show would have failed. the costumes are very good. still shots of the models (aka actors) are very good. with the acting, the costumes disappear and we are in the world of british sounding loser actors. it's a joke. so, what we have here is a mix of medieval and fantasy, similar to lord of the rings, with politics, ridiculous sex, incest, and killings. writing sucks. acting is horrible. you can tell some of the actors are trying. others are just fashion models. not actors. similar quick edit fight scenes like star wars farce awakens or avengers or superman/fatman nonsense. this show is basically for grownups with the mentality of a very stupid 15 year old. so, while i watch, i will be a retarded 15 year old for the duration of each episode. mindless nonsense! i guess it's too much to ask for a decent story with decent acting. thank you, and good night."
2019-05-19,aboalhyjaa,A few thing i needed to say about *game of thrones*,5,"i can say after finishing the last season(which is the worst), yet i would name it as the best fantasy, action and drama i have ever seen.though i do understand the criticism i have read from other viewers. yes, its the worst season. yes, there is a lot of mistakes. but i cant give less than a perfect rating to show that i enjoyed this much. season 8 added great action and special effects, a lots of mementum, frightening horror, and some long,awaited conclusions to some of the characters.what can i say guys except that it's absolutely incredible, i love got."
2019-05-21,azanspy,The watch has ended in a very bad way.,10,"game of thrones is simply one of the best series made in many ways. it had breathtaking visuals, a very talented cast, good directors etc. the writing of first seven seasons were epic. there is no better word other than epic for what they gave us in these episodes. i love game of thrones because it is not predictable. things happen entirely different way than we expect.the writing was very bad in the final season. the only thing that went wrong in season 8 was the writing. all other departments were exactly what game of thrones was. but the writing was poor and there was no sense of feeling in it. daenerys going mad is not bad at all. it is a good twist. but they rushed it. the final four episodes had big storylines which atleast should be made in 3 episodes. if they would have gone with this storyline with 2 more seasons, it will be not as bad as it is. all seven seasons were slow but that was one of the things i liked about it. i loved every tiny detail they show. the final season had nothing.i would rate the first seven seasons a 9/10 and the final season a 5/10. i am giving 5 for the electrifying performances and breathtaking visuals. this is not how a epic series like got should have ended. there was a sense of feeling and memories when i watched a few masterpieces end. like breaking bad, harry porter, endgame etc. got didn't gave any. the final episode was simply the worst episode in the whole series. i will continue watching and recommend got to others for its seven seasons of wonder.thanks to the creators, the talented cast, the crew. i will remember got for it's epic seven seasons and what the final season should have been."

2013-02-23,dragokin,epic fantasy for adults,10,"it took me a couple of episodes to start liking game of thrones. probable reason is that i expected ""tolkien for adults"". well, there's definitely a lot of adults' stuff here, although closer to reality of middle ages, if this might apply to a fantasy novel about an imaginary world turned tv show. since i haven't read the book(s), i was free to enjoy the show as it is.at certain points game of thrones might have passed for a historical reenactment. magic and other fantasy elements were introduced at a slow pace which adds to the realism mentioned above. the production and sets were impressive and the cast delivered and exquisite performance.overall, game of thrones was television's logical answer to lord of the rings. together with the latter title it has set the bar for fantasy films and tv shows very high. i would even say that they've spoiled the audiences. any new venture in the genre will have to fulfill very high expectations.edit after season 5my enthusiasm waned although the appreciation remains. my recap would be: good season 1, solid season 2, rather eventless season 3 and somewhat redeeming season 4. season 5 was an obvious management decision in an attempt to create the most massive cliffhanger finale in the history of tv. there is one for every story line in the show.what became apparent already in season 3 is what some fans complained about when discussing g.r.r. martin's writing. there is a clear lack of direction, what some might label narrative fiction. during season 5 we've reached the end of plots in the books published so far. this, in turn, enabled the writers to write as they well pleased and stretch the audience's attention span until the end of season 7."
2011-04-18,judywalker2,Great actors in a really boring story,10,"i was looking forward to the new hbo series ""game of thrones"". i have been disappointed by camelot and have missed the boldness of spartacus. i am a huge fantasy and period piece fan and had high hopes for this fantasy, since i was told it had great characters and great scope. i am also a fan of sean bean for his lotr's portrayal of boromir and other movies. i've tried to get into this series but i just can't. i don't understand how any of these people have survived; they just go around killing each other. no one is smart except the dwarf and dean's youngest daughter but alas the dwarf has become just another repetitive idiot and the little girl is a minor character that you hardly ever see. it's just not an interesting story. i bought the book which i might read. maybe the written story will be better. this is a real disappointment for a fan of history piece and fantasy. there is not fantasy in it just endless people looking ugly and sad.3/10"

2019-06-10,bregund,Amended review,10,"rarely do i agree with everyone else, but season eight was truly awful. it was so bad that i deleted my glowing review of seasons 1,7, which was simply the best television viewing it has ever been my pleasure to witness. the spectacular highs of the early seasons trickled down to spectacular lows, and if you disagree with me, then in a show filled with poetic justice, tell me exactly how satisfying it was for cersei to die with the ceiling falling on her? completely idiotic writing."
2015-07-28,latinfineart,Season five has gone off the rails. Just not the same show.,4,"it feels like they really lost sight of the plot for season 5. it just did not have any of the charm, nor many of the incredible sets, costumes, or atmosphere of the previous four seasons. the character development was weak, the stories didn't feel like they went anywhere, and it just felt like the whole team perhaps is a bit jaded. the writing has suffered, it is just not the same show that it used to be. the characters were not developed much further, and the dialogue got leaden. not sure where they are intending to go with this, but quite frankly, not sure i want to know. and i loved the first four seasons. i barely feel any motivation for season 6 if there's going to be one. i'm about as excited about that, as the upcoming episode of star wars."
2019-06-28,latinfineart,A solid show with a horrific last season,9,"i would not call myself a game of thrones fan. i did enjoy the first five seasons. i thought they were creative, fascinating, somewhat original, well written and beautifully produced, well acted and quite entertaining. the sixth and seventh season i thought it was ok, nothing special. the last season was just unbelievably horrendous. i just don't know how you take such a promising premise, how you stock it full of such interesting characters, and then you just create something so lifeless, so devoid of purpose and so mediocre.game of thrones is not one of the best tv shows ever made as many posters here like to say. breaking bad yes. dexter yes, deadwood yes, true detective yes. game of thrones is not in their league on any level. sure, the production values of the first five seasons were great, but the presence of the characters is so inconsistent, the stories are so wobbly and the finale is so poor i don't know how anybody could give this a 9.4.the last season is a train wreck."
2017-10-22,kaefab,Most overrated and boring series ever,9,"its 2017 i have been hearing about this series ever since its started and how everyone raves about it. so amazing best thing since slice bread.i recently got netflix and i said hey why not, so the first season went by and i was like ok, its a slow started i guess, but season2 will get better,mmmm no not that much but a few people told me season 3 is where it picks up.. i am currently on episode 4 of the third season and bored out of my mine.yes the women are beautiful and there is a lot of sex scenes but you can't watch a series only for this. i was expecting lots of fighting, monsters, and so on but you get a small glimpse of it and the payback is far too long.i am not sure if i am gonna give up on the series but this is super overrated compared to stranger things where it got me hook and i watch it in 1 day..... i wish i could say that same about games of thrones."
2016-08-06,khunkrumark,Sooooo slow!,8,"because of the hoopla over this show i have downloaded and watched the first two series.boy, is it slow... like watching a ship move out of its mooring, it's slow! blackadder is much better than this and it also has lord flashheart.the best character is the dwarf with his horrendous accent that makes dick van dyke's cockney waanker in mary poppins sound word,perfect! i can't believe that not one of the almost entirely british cast didn't have the balls or dignity to sidle up to the director and mention this awful, catastrophic and annoying accent. was he doing it on purpose as some kind of joke?anyway, that aside, these hour-long episodes could easily have been edited down to 20 minutes or so, without anyone losing a moment of plot significance. nothing much happens except people chat about the past and make plans for wars.lots of men hugging when they haven't seen each other for a long time or they are going off to battle, etc... something else i'm pretty sure never happened in the olden days. overall, even after you list every other fault this mess has, the biggest one still remains the most significant... it's just dull. there is just so much boring dialog to wade through before anything happens.i can't complete any more of this torture. i'll wait for the movie version."
2021-02-21,nicofreezer,"A pretty good show, but no greatness",10,"8/10 is the maximum you can give this show.i hate to said it, but got is one of the most overated show ever.still it is a must watch, great characters some great story line, but got prevent itself from greatest and its a waste. it has the potentiel of being a top 5 show ever but its not a top 15... too many useless characters too many useless very long talk and storyline no one care about, just there to add minutes to the show.enormous potentiel, sometime wasted the best seasons are 1 6 and 7 , worst are between 2 and 5.like i said an 8/10 show, must watch, but no greanest like breaking bad or x files or lost by exemple."
2020-05-29,xavier_stone,One Watch Only,10,"this is an amazing show with excellent writing up until the last two seasons, where the writers decided to take their own direction and divert from the books. it's a horrendous error.
so many mistakes, uncharacteristic decisions and it becomes a internet meme, with a whole reddit subgroup called freefolk to vent viewers frustration, and eventually a petition calling for the ending to be rewritten.
most excellent television shows and movies stand up to a rewatching, but this one doesn't as pointless events start popping up and the whole thing gets aggravating.
anything the the d and d writers do from now on is forever tainted by their laziness evident in their quick wrap up attempt at soloing the ending."

Epic,10,"not sure my vocabulary is vast enough to truly list the superlatives that this series deserves!from the opening music and scenes got is a class above most tv series hands down! i have watched every episode of every season and i can say hand on heart it has been the best acting,script,cinematography,special effects, etc i have ever had the pleasure to watch. so much so that when the last instalments of the series are shown,i intend to watch the entire series all over again from the start . star rating is not high enough as i can only give it 10 and it's worth a lot more"
2019-05-23,frankblack-79961,"A great ride, til it drops you on your ass.",9,superb until season 8. hbo stuck it to the fans in a big way with the last season. the writers wanted 4 more episodes for season 8 and hbo would not give it to them. they had to cram 10 episodes into 6. it shows. prepare to be mesmerized for 7 seasons and then let down in a big way. hbo does this crap all the time. i'm done with their shows.

2019-05-27,stevenrotherforth,TV King of the world almost dethroned by a poor final season,1,"game of throneshaving been a fan of this show right from the beginning and only watching each episode as they were aired much has been forgotten. it is perhaps the disappointing final season that sadly lingers in the memory banks.
but one fact always remains.
game of thrones or g.o.t for those in the know is perhaps one of the greatest television events in the history of the tube.
a show that rivals and surpasses many a big screen blockbuster.so what's all the fuss about?
why has this show struck a chord with so many viewers around the globe?
well as the great imdb simply explains.
""nine noble families fight for control over the mythical lands of westeros, while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for thousands of years.""
g.o.t offers much more than this simple synopsis suggests.
there's action,drama, romance, horror and the well timed piece of humour thrown in for good measure.
just about every cinematic ingredient known to mankind is cooked up and presented on to the small screen.
maybe this show should have been reserved for the the cinema.
that being said g.o.t is best viewed on the largest tv possible with the best sound available.
a show best reserved for blu,ray rather than screening on compressed satellite or cable tv.
the dire third episode of the final season (the long night) being a prime example. many complained that the battle with the dead was poorly lit when in fact it was most probably the compressed broadcast that was to blame.
when viewed correctly the word ""epic' does not do this show justice.
as seasons progress the budget grows considerably bigger.
with c.g.i and cinematography worthy of
an oscar or whatever accolades a tv show can be awarded. g.o.t is fine tv viewing.
all performances by a splendid cast are superb.
pick your favourite character. there's a rich array to choose from.
good or evil. every actor and actress in this show are on top form.
as are the scriptwriters adapting george r.r martins series of novels.
it is only the final season which feels rushed, forced and anticlimactic after seven strong previous seasons.
i hope this show isn't remembered for its disappointing finale when we have been gifted with some fantastic television since 2011.
i recommend that you watch this show even if you believe that the genre isn't to your taste.
you'll be surprised. at the end of the day quality is quality and there's no mistaking for the most part this show is of the highest."
2014-02-19,pro jury,Mix of good and bad,10,"what is good: casting, production values, complexity and a fairly good balance or mix of action, drama, comedy and romance.compared to the recent arthur, merlin and pillars series, game of thrones is extremely well cast. there are no major blunders with actors picked to play lead characters. this is an accomplishment.i also like that it has the fire&ice opening credits lending it a timeless tv vibe.and most of all about game, i really love watching the young shakira actress who plays the queen/mother of the dragons. her every body movement is consistently slow. there is a sexy slow motion grace with her hip,popping shakira ""suerte"" outfit sometimes worn, sometimes not worn... 100% slow-dreamy pleasure. beyond good.but there are problems (going by tv / leaving books aside). we see no build-up or justification for ned stark to ever want to actually be a temporary regent. ok, yes, he might be willing to do it out of kindness, friendship or whatever, but nothing is ever shown to ever tell us that he was so blindingly dumb or blindingly power-hungry or blindingly anything to ever want to risk wasting his time to be a temporary regent, let alone push to do it, let alone risk life or limb to do it... let alone risking his defenseless children to do it.""our old dead king wanted me to be regent for a while, but if you all are fine, i will return to winterfell and stay busy minding the north for you. any problems, write."" this would be a win-win. this would be easiest. this would carry the least risk. ned stark had no motivation to do what was unpleasant, to do what was hard, to do what was risky, once his king friend was dead and gone.when in prison helpless and powerless, a childless neuter had to remind ned that he has children in danger. the respected ned stark - forgetting he is a father. forgetting he has children to protect. not realistic. another problem is the most evil players in game are invincible. year after year, the great bad guys cannot be removed from ""the game"". real fighting kills the great good guys, but never the great bad guys. magic kills the great good guys, but never the great bad guys. invincible bad guys ultimately make a story gloomy and pointless.another problem is neutral parties, when given a choice between joining a brutal dishonest ruthless untrustworthy power-mad king, or joining a king with honor seeking justice rather than power -- the neutral parties will always join the dangerous untrustworthy king. this is reckless and unrealistic.another problem is the greatest, most complex, most sweeping deception seen in the entire series was carried out by a loony old man with no right hand seen to conduct small things, let alone great secret things. no team running anything. the old man keeps his sons at a distance. he openly treats them with no respect. his sons show no like for him. his daughters are even more worthless.this weak old man could see his wife easily killed with no bother, all the while, he is surrounded by his adult children who hate him? the feeble old man is at the mercy of his close kin, so how could he not expect them to punish him for not caring to protect one of them? not realistic. he dares eat a meal after what he did?leaving aside the old man's unhappy nest, what about the army of the good king? why is the army of the good king loyal enough to win mighty battles, yet not loyal enough to seek any revenge when the feeble old man somehow manages to kill the good king?game has too many 80yo men making babies and having hard interactions with young ladies. this is olden times long before the invention of serious ed drugs?and although the shakira queen is a pleasure to look at, year after year she says some really dumb things. ""if x, i will die. if x, i will kill you. after i am dead? i think."" i don't care much for the magic and supernaturalism. game would be better without it. but even more distracting is the use of modern language. lots of modern slang language is used in game, excused as being the common tongue. but as soon as the modern slang erupts, the illusion to olden times completely disappears. much effort and costly production values have gone into the illusion of being in ancient times, it seems a shame to ruin it all every 13mins for no good reason. the illusion is more powerful, for example, when the young stark girl speaks with jaqur. it is weakest when the dwarf and/or the hound start speaking slang.the final weakness is with general realism. game is far too modern with its social treatment of butch lesbians and dwarfs. it also lacks realism by having far too much happen at night. visit a primitive location on earth today where electricity is rare, just as modern birth control is rare, and see how life begins at morning light. with no fridge or freezers, see how fresh food comes from the swarms of chickens walking everywhere all of the time. rich people have many chickens running around. poor people have not so many. but clearly, chickens and roosters rule the sounds of morning. along with a sea of chickens, every young women has an infant, a 1+2+3yo and so on. a simple village is brimming with toddlers and infants. if chickens and babies are not seen everywhere, they are heard everywhere.having many small animals & toddlers make a production difficult, but these simple realistic sounds are not heard. game looks like an old place, but it doesn't sound like an old primitive place. game has many problems."
2017-07-18,jetkot,Too Slow for my liking,10,"to me this show is extremely slow for my liking. i enjoy thrillers only when they are fast,paced.there are plenty of scenes where characters keep having a conversation for close to 20 mins and nothing substantial happens in that episode i would rather watch another thriller or horror that gives me edge of the seat thrill and does not bore me with long conversations."
2020-02-11,pukeonthestreet,There's a reason everyone likes it,10,it's not over hyped. it's really well written and just as well acted. someone people hated the ending but they have to admit they never would have thought of it.
2016-06-08,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Game of Thrones,"" Season 1",2,"i liked season 1 of ""game of thrones;"" i really did. i don't yet love the show in the same way that so many other people do, however, and i'd honestly rate this 10,episode season an 8 out of 10. if that sounds like faint praise for a show that seems universally loved, i concede that my criticisms really reflect my own personal tastes, not to mention my admittedly narrow attention span.it's an undeniably well made show, in terms of everything from acting to set design. its densely plotted story (with so many characters!) suggests to me that it is probably true to george r. r. martin's books, which i have not read. the show seems like an authentic adaptation that respects the viewer's intelligence and consequently demands a lot of him or her.there is a lot to admire, such as the show's attention to a myriad of details in order to meticulously render martin's fantasy universe. peter dinklage is consistently wonderful to watch as tyrion lannister. aidan gillen and conleth hill are both downright shakespearian as littlefinger and varys, the two duplicitous members of the court at king's landing. lena headey (cersei lannister), charles dance (tywin lannister) and iain glen (jorah mormont) are also all favorites of mine. (glen is none other than the ""resident evil"" films' original wesker! and he has such a damn cool voice.)the script, direction and production values all usually seem quite good. the show even has moments of brilliance -- the first episode's opening teaser, in which we witness an attack on the border wall by the icy ""white walker"" monsters, was scarier than a hell of a lot of horror movies i've seen.which brings us to my frustrations, and, yes, they are mostly subjective. i actually did bring certain appetites as an audience member that weren't met. i craved more action, and greater emotional payoff for the dialogue-heavy story arcs that built tension throughout the first season. (caveat: i am a fan of both horror movies and war films, and i suspect i'm not exactly the target audience for what is essentially a political thriller in a fantasy context.)the inaugural episode's white walkers were what i was dying to see the most. and i do think they should have been featured more prominently, from a storytelling perspective. otherwise they shouldn't have served as the teaser-opener for the entire season. nor should they have been the plot driver for the story lines connected with the wall and the night's watch.we also see extensive preparations for war, and military maneuvering -- we even have important scenes taking place at troop encampments. but there is absolutely no climax for these steadily building plot developments. i know i sound like a 13 year old, and maybe i am just not sophisticated enough to enjoy the show on its current levels, but i wanted see a battle. from a storytelling perspective, i suggest it's a bad creative decision to end the season without allowing us to truly witness a major land engagement. i do realize that we indeed see one house's brutal invasion of another's castle, and that it's well done. but it was too brief. again, while ""game of thrones"" has all the trappings of a period war series, this is a political thriller in a fantasy context.as for the machiavellian politics, i am embarrassed to admit that i got lost early on. yes, i'm fully aware that others are able to follow these plot threads quite easily. (my college chums can.) i'd just advise another viewer of average intelligence that their enjoyment might be affected by an unusually detailed story that requires their strict attention.finally, i do feel that there is a dearth of likable and identifiable characters. nearly every major player is motivated by an ignoble goal (power). many betray one another; that's the show's favorite plot point. sean bean's eddard stark is only a putative hero, to me. yes, he's fighting for the rightful heir to the throne, but he's still serving a monarchy; he's not sticking up for the common man or anything. (we see loyalty among various characters to various noblemen, but nobody seems to care about the peasants.) furthermore, stark's actions toward a scared subordinate in the first episode made me unsympathetic to him. (i don't care who has vowed to do what -- his action in the series premier was unwarranted.)jon snow is well scripted as a ""good"" character, but the actor portraying him needs to work on his range. kit harrington is decent in the role, but he too often looks like a sad, spurned poet. (hey, it's okay, snowman, i've been there myself.)daenerys targaryen appears to be a ""good"" character, and i do like her. she's thinly rendered, though, despite what seems like an inordinate amount of screen time devoted to her major subplot. (and this subplot, with its legions of bare-chested barbarians, seems like a slowly paced cousin of the 1990's ""xena: warrior princess."") daenerys seems like an obvious power-fantasy for victimized women. (yeah, i know there's nothing wrong with that. and, yeah, i know that people say something similar about my beloved comic book movies.)with all of these criticisms, it may sound as though i didn't enjoy ""game of thrones."" to the contrary, i did. if you like fantasy and are looking for something well made and different, i'd recommend you try this. i think maybe i'm just trying to justify my more modest enthusiasm for one of contemporary pop culture's sacred cows."
2018-07-27,arjunflamingfeather,A Seasonal Achievement in Cinematography.,10,"visuals from castles are a proof of the achievements in our hearts of this epic television show called 'game of thrones.' the seven seasons are filled with adult content and successful achievements by actors who like 'jon snow' trained entire day: a shot in the 'battle of the bastards' took cinematographers to shoot a visual of seconds an entire day; repeating the shot throughout the day.  the micro and macro reality is that the show has lived: budget and profits have made the television show a success and we recommend the tv program for users. international movie data base has millions of users rating this tv show which like an epidemic; crossed the middle,ages to twenty first century with action figures like of 'jon' in our homes. 
the assessment of relationships in 'game of thrones' is an english nightmare like the kings who lived in castles across the english speaking worlds but they created us who speak the language."
2015-04-21,coreyjdenford,Seven Kingdoms of epic.,8,"this is the best tv show in the world every season was just outstandingly good and i was at the edge of my seat all the way through. the story has originality and a great script my favourite episode to date is season 4 episode 10. every season on episode 9 you see brilliant plot outbursts that really stand out to the whole story of the show.spoilers: season 1 episode 9 had the beheading of edard stark(sean bean) season 2 episode 9 had the giant battle outside kings landing with green fire. season 3 episode 9 was when some of the main characters got killed off like catlin and rob stark. finally season 4 episode 9 had a massive battle with giants and mammoths from the wildlings north of the wall and they were against castle black, and also is the only episode without tyrion lannister(peter dinklage). although throughout the whole of the show there at least one death in every episode. end of spoilers.throughout the show there is great acting and great character development and also good story development. the only season which wasn't that great because well it had some limits it wasn't as fluid as the previous seasons and that was season 3 i don't know why but season 3 wasn't as fluid but then season 4 brought back the no holds barred rating again (18). my favourite character at this moment is arya stark(maisie williams) because she is just a bad,ass and also she is a fantastic character because she has witnessed the loss of her father edard stark but plus the reason why i like arya is because that her story takes a big part in the show and that i think makes a key character. i recommend this tv show to everyone because even though some people may not like it because they it's just like the lord of the rings trilogy it actually has no references from none of them films. this tv is excellent and epic and literally the best thing on tv right now. 10/10."

2019-08-10,asb_deutsch,One of the best TV treasures troves!,8,"this reminds me how i felt when the dark knight trilogy ended. i loved growing up with batman and how nolan resurrected things but yes, if you recall the last installment, there were many flaws in it and the audience had to accept it. we have to move on and i am experiencing the same sentiments while watching this episode.let's move on with the subject. it is not a perfect episode but not an episode to be thrashed. the audience are simply denigrating the creators d&d. got started with so many characters from season 1 that it was very hard to remember all of them. after season 5, most of the characters have been killed off, which the viewers seem incorrigible to that.if you happen to recall the script of season 1, it all starts with the mad king and season 8 finishes with the mad queen. if you watch the post,show interview of d&d, they have showed a clip of season 1 when dany's brother is executed and her liner speaks ""he was never a dragon"". the fire was further unleashed when the witch was burnt and the intensity of the fire got bigger and bigger. season 2 depicts the king of qarth locked with the dragons in a vault to die; the unsullied are instructed to slaughter every master in the city of mereen; and also burnt all of dothraki khals alive after being held captive by them. it is not the scriptwriters but the audience who don't deserve this show. the moments of madness were always there but we got involved in too much vulgarness of the show that we forgot how the story started. it is human nature that we complain of everything!my ratings (based on what i marked on imdb):
average (season 1-8) = 8.60
average (season 5-8) = 7.21"
2020-12-21,debbss,I'm just going to forget about season 8...,8,"in my opinion, game of thrones is the greatest show to ever be created, even with its terrible writing at the end of the show. seasons 1,6 were some of the best season that i have ever seen in a tv show; with its deep and complicated characters, to its interesting and well thought-out plots. when games of thrones was at its peak, it had the best writing on television, but sadly, this great show didn't get an ending it truly deserved.it's obvious that seasons 7 and 8 were rushed. the writers knew what they wanted to do, but for some reason they wanted to finish game of thrones asap. there should've been a season 9, or maybe a season 10. season 8 was so rushed that it was extremely jarring to watch. daenerys went from wanting to save the people of king's landing, to needlessly murdering all of the innocents, in just a couple of episodes. all of the beloved characters changed; they felt like shells of who they formerly were. the final episode was also very disappointing. nobody wanted bran to be king, not even bran himself wanted to be king; none of the characters got a good ending that they deserved. season 8 was just really disappointing to watch because everything else before season 8 felt pointless due to the final episode.aside from the final season, game of thrones is perfect. the acting is as good as it gets, the plots were well written, the characters had layers, and the vfx was impressive to say the least. it really blew me away when watching this show, because of how high the budget was. the production design, the makeup, the editing, and the outfits were on a level that you'd expect from a hollywood film with an endless budget. the budget of this show offered a quality that you'd never get from any other tv show.i love game of thrones so much that i have to give it a 10/10. i know how bad it got during the finale, but this show was so well crafted that i feel like if i gave it anything lower, i would be doing game of thrones a disservice. i think everyone needs to experience game of thrones, even with its extremely underwhelming finale. and if you're reading this spoiler ridden review without actually watching the show, i highly recommend game of thrones to those who haven't seen it."
2019-09-09,thehoodofswords,Amazing Everything,3,"(reviewed as i watch each season)season 1 , beautiful storytelling, and one of the best shows i have ever seen. with the right amount of gore, romance and adventure it makes got amazing to watch. my biggest gripe is it feels everything builds up for not that much payoff. 8/10season 2 - loved it even more then the first, we get to see more of the fantasy elements of the world. not to mention some more character building for my favorite characters, jon snow and daenerys. we also get to see some more large battles and stunning events unfold. 9/10season 3 - the story is really ramping up, there is a lot more action and a lot more things are happening. everything really is beginning to all come together. we get to see the characters conflicted with themselves and others. 9/10season 4 - things ramp up in this season we get some great cinematography and amazing scenes of fighting and some great moments between characters, truly an amazing season of peak television. 10/10season 5 - i said that in season 4 things ramp up, i was wrong, things were just getting started, this season has some of the most brutal scenes in all of got. we get some absolutely amazing arya stark moments which i love. as well as a few scenes with a certain ominous someone. jon as always is amazing. 10/10season 6 - i can't even say anything about this season, it is amazing. it's my favorite season ever. i could give this a 10/10 from the last 2 episodes alone. this season takes on more of a battle of the 1 vs the many, but it is done brilliantly. the tenth episode still has a lot of action, which is something that doesn't happen as often in got as you might think. overall, 11/10 amazing!!!!season 7 - look, going into the last couple season i had heard they were bad, but i really don't see it? this season means we get to see characters meet that have never seen each other before, it's crazy with even more character development and amazing battles.season - 8 alright, i'm not going to lie and say this season is as amazing as the other's. but i also don't think its nearly as bad as other's have said. while i do feel like it is a bit rushed episode 3 is brilliant and the stunning imagery in the later episodes are very beautiful . character's go a bit wonky but it's still an enjoyable season and a satisfying conclusion for all characters. 7.5/10final review: game of thrones is a brilliantly constructed show with compelling characters and amazingly brutal and intense action scenes throughout the whole show."
2019-04-15,aarongnr,To whoever didnt like it...,3,"why do you all expect this to be a full blown movie filled with plot, fights and everything? this is a season premiere. have you ever seen a show where all the awesome action already happened in the first episode? thks is still a tv show. i hoped for them to bring everything together and wrap up all unasnwered questions, and they did. and: they did it even better than i had hoped.and to those who complain about this not being a feature length episode: have you been living under a rock? the lengths of the episodes have been out for weeks. if you dont expect every episode to be a winds of winter, you will also have a lot more fun watching it.ps: the jokes worked really well and they also did for almost everyone who was in the theatre with me."
2019-05-20,thebricks,Great show ruined by the most unbelievable series finale of all time,10,"just stop watching after season 6. it's pure trash after that. i've never seen a series finale turn an entire show from a 10 to a zero in five minutes. all these years, more if you've been reading since 1996, and they just wasted it making the least likely character to win king. the last two episodes are chock full of lame anti,war propaganda using different characters as plot devices to spread the agenda. it's a shame what happened to this show."
2017-05-03,backup-50362,"Quite overrated and an insult to men, what a great show, right?",5,"surely a few annoying and immensely unlike,able characters, mixed with violence and nudity shouldn't be enough to get this show to a rating as high as breaking bad's...yet here it is. there's quite a lot of generic 'female empowerment' porn which is why, i assume, the ratings are high. beyond the ridiculousness of it all, the unreasonable and unrealistic characters, and poor story telling, which i admit, in the first two seasons was just good enough to keep you watching, is a bad show. only getting worse.aside from the dwarf and john snow, literally zero of the characters have realistic or like-able traits. the dragon b**ch is most annoying. everything goes her way for most of the seasons, for no reason whatsoever, just because. at least bleach her thick eyebrows.a certain plot twist where a certain family (some of it) gets killed caught me off guard, i admit, however what simpletons might see as 'great, edgy plot development' just seems lazy to me.""let's kill off as many as we can so the script can be easier to write, yet keep saying '9 families' in the promos so it seems like a lot is going on.""i almost forgot - the little girl with the needle sword - worst character and worst acting in the whole movie. you gave hodor one line and even he's less wooden and bland, in fact - much less.the fighting sequences look too fake, poorly choreographed. most of the movie is too dark, which isn't the de facto easiest way to set a mood, as some movie directors might be thinking. there's a lot of quiet whispering and mumbling which suddenly shifts to much louder horse sounds, annoying screeching babies or women getting screwed as the next scene beings. both visually and sound- wise, things shift radically and it's only annoying, nothing else.aside for the first two seasons being respectfully capable of keeping you watching, certain things that were said by the dragon b**ch along with everything mentioned above suddenly made me hate this show, as that's when i realized - beneath the cgi and all the money wasted - it's just another generic female-pandering show.from the comic con panels you can clearly see none of the ""oh so empowered"" female actresses from this show are attached to it, as they're busy patting each other on the backs and being generally arrogant. if the writing didn't portray them as intelligent and ""so empowered at the expense of men"" in the show - all you'd have is simpletons and weaklings crumbling."
2019-11-14,jaypatton88,The Best TV series HBO ever made,6,"loved this show from episode one season one to the final episode, i wish they would have continued to make more seasons; there is so many more directions this multi directional show could have gone"
2018-05-02,nightroses,The best thing ever on TV,10,"this is the best thing i've ever seen on television. ""game of thrones"" has stunning super special effects, great storylines, complex characters, many things to wonder about, magic, mystery, fantasy. it's otherworldly but i almost wish i could go there and visit places in westeros and essos. it's got a realistic feel about it, more than any other fictional world. it's more vivid than dr who and tolkien's middle earth. it's better than star trek and i was always a trekkie. it's right up my alley. it's got dragons too! the battles are epic and the actors are so good. i've been reading the books that the series is based on and i understand it isn't possible to include everything but that doesn't matter. this isn't just tv but its art and a masterpiece."
2013-03-31,bluesman-20,Winter is coming.,9,"george rr martin's a song of fire and ice is as epic and fantastic a series,set in the sword and sorcery mold as there ever has been. it's longer then the lord of the rings and five times as engrossing. the game of thrones tv series is just as great. it's a grand story filled with heroics. villainy and magic of the darkest foulest kind. but unlike the lord of the rings. the games of thrones also has another edge. politics,and family loyalities. betrayal and manipulations that seem impulsive have resounding consequences. this is maybe one of the few shows on tv where actions have reactions the walking dead is the other show where this has happened. for all of it's grandeur and glory. this is one of the only shows on tv where it doesn't have any flaws. it's that good. or if it does have flaws we're too busy having a good time to notice them. subtle hints are tossed thru out the show as to what is going to happen. you just have to keep watching to see if you're right or wrong.imagination is king. and this show is full of imagination. it's full of the stuff that makes legends. each episode makes you want more. and the story carries you along relentlessly and mercilessly. you are caught in it's grasp. and you are going to thank god that you are. because it's the best kind of trap to be caught in. nothing is what it seems. and little things mean big things. and evil walks the world some disguised as humans. some disguised as monsters.while heroes look like ordinary people or look like monsters the only thing separating them is the actions of their hearts. and the game of thrones plays on."
2011-08-17,shanayneigh,Underwhelming,1,"i had heard nothing but praise about this show from friends, and i have nothing against fantasy, so i gave it a shot.if you have read the books, this show might be the best thing since sliced bread, but for a casual viewer it's a let down. as i understand it, the plans are to do one book per season. but judging from season 1, there simply isn't enough material in one book for almost 10 hours of television. let's compare it to the ""lord of the rings"" trilogy, where the total running time for all three movies , in the extended editions, mind you - is roughly 12 hours. i think ""game of thrones"" would benefit greatly from merging two books into, say, a 12 episode season. 6 hours per book is still abundant to tell the story.one common problem with make believe kingdoms and countries (not only with the fantasy genre) is the geography. i remember the first time i read ""lord of the rings"" in an edition which had no map, and it made no goddamned sense where all the places were in relation to one another, which led to a frustrating read. but ""game of thrones"" solves this problem beautifully in the opening credits.the opening scene set in a wintery landscape on the other side of the wall, or whatever it's called, is very good and it sets up a nice feel of mystery. but sadly, it's all downhill from there. the multitude of characters are for the most part one-dimensional and unengaging. the plot sprawls thin and lacks direction, making me lose interest quite quickly."
2020-01-01,renegadeviking-271-528568,Masterpiece,8,"brienne is one of the few characters in game of thrones who has always been truly honourable and since her introduction i've grown to love her and root for her to show the world how incredible a woman she is. therefore, one of the highlights of this finale for me was seeing brienne taking her place first as one of those representatives tasked with choosing the next ruler, and then on the small council, where she can help build a better future for the citizens of the six kingdoms (that still sounds odd to me). who better to be commander of bran's kingsguard?having been knighted in 8.02 (one of the best scenes in the series for me) as a knight of the realm, once sansa split the north away from the other kingdoms, it made sense to me that brienne would step up in this way. sansa has the support of the entire north again. she's home and safe, so brienne can move on to serve and protect another of catelyn's children. she wanted to be a knight, she wanted to serve the realm and she's always wanted to do good. if any character deserved to see their dreams come true in a world were we are used to that rarely happening, it was brienne. the fact it is brienne, who gets to take over from jaime lannister in her new role, is the final piece of the puzzle (i don't count the mountain).speaking of jaime, the scene i'd said for years that i wanted to see if he really had to die, was brienne filling his pages in the kingsguard book with his good deeds. ever since vile joffrey mocked him for his empty pages and brienne read the words, i've wondered if this would be part of the ending. personally, i loved it and it was the scene that made me the most emotional this week. i know many have grumbled about brienne doing this after jaime left her in 8.04, seeing it as a woman serving the story of a man, but that's not how i see this plot line at all. yes, it completed jaime's story and yes, she perhaps described the events in the most favourable way, but bear in mind for his entire adult life, he was viewed in a negative light for an action which, like jon's, was for the greater good. seeing the devastation dany caused only reinforced just how significant his choice was when he killed the mad king. yes, he broke brienne's heart and i hated it (putting them together in 8.04 both gave me what i wanted, while also giving me what i didn't , thanks again to the rushing), but i also loved that be giving us this scene, they also brought to the forefront again, how special brienne is.she has always done what was just and honourable and has always believed in the good in people and it was because of her that many of the deeds she added to the book even happened! jaime may have hurt her, but we saw she wasn't bitter and wanted the good he did to be recorded. she didn't let his last action cancel out all the others. i also loved that it was clear in that scene that she still cared deeply for him and had forgiven him for being unable to leave his past behind. why do i say that? she still carried oathkeeper; in such a sparse room there was a lion statue prominent on the table behind her; and the music playing over the scene was (i think) a blend of ""a knight of the seven kingdoms"" (played when she was knighted) and ""i am hers, she is mine"" (which has accompanied scenes with both robb/tulisa and tyrion/shae), reinforcing the special connection they shared. add to that, the beautiful performance by gwendoline christie (she better be nominated for awards); you see the emotion brienne is holding back in her eyes as she writes, as she takes her time to complete her task, all before she runs her hand over the page gently before closing it. yes, it gives jaime closure and honour again, but it also is a testament to who she is as a person. if we were all a little more like brienne, we'd all be better for it.few characters so richly deserved to end their story with all the respect and status they'd always dreamed of. i'm only sad we won't get to see all the good deeds that she will do, that will fill her own pages.a final musical chapter for television's most ambitious soundtracki'm a big fan of film and television scores and few are ever as impressive as this one and a consistent comment about season eight from me and many others, has been just how incredible ramin djawadi's score has been. over the years, he has created beautiful themes for characters, houses, while setting the mood for every political manoeuvre and shredding our nerves while watching every battle.season eight has seen him play with themes to great emotional effect and the iron throne was no different. his slower rendition of the rains of castamere, associated so heavily with the violence of the red wedding, heightened tyrion's grief and i've already spoken above about his delicate way of bringing the history of jaime and brienne's relationship in to the story's end. dany's tragic end contained callbacks to her and jon's theme and we also had the rousing farewell to the starks, blending the theme most associated with their house, with the series's theme, while also throwing in echoes of their past (arya sailed away to echoes of the same theme she had at the end of season 4 for example). few shows have scores that are so ingrained in the emotions of the scenes, that you can see them as you listen to the music on its own, but season 8's music in particular certainly achieves this. ramin, please hurry up and announce international dates for the next game of thrones music tour! until then, i'll have the albums on my constant playlist!a visual masterpiece, setting a new bar for television & film!even those less happy with this season have agreed that visually, nothing compares to game of thrones, in terms of the quality of the cinematography, visual effects and overall production values. in a way, i think we've become complacent about how each episode has a visual quality that surpasses not just other television shows, but most films too and the finale certainly didn't drop the ball in this area.we had the terrifying images of dany addressing her armies, the breathtaking image of her literally being a dragon, as drogon's wings unfolded behind her, the haunting echoes of her vision of coming face to face with the throne and the incredible framing of her death in jon's arms. drogon has now become so realistic, that you simply accept that there's a huge dragon on screen, screaming at the loss of its mother, nudging her lifeless body and then unleashing fire, finally removing the damn throne from the world! plus, that stark montage? gorgeous. i only hope this series has set the bar for other shows to try and surpass in the future.then there were all the little nods / call backs to the last eight years.....okay, i admit, i didn't pick up on all of these on the first viewing and i assume i've not even noticed them all yet, but the series finale was full of nods to the show's past, some obvious and some wonderfully subtle. there were the breathtaking costume choices (look at sansa's coronation dress - weirwood leaves, dire wolves and fish scales, to represent every aspect of her heritage), the old jokes (tyrion is clearly never meant to finish that brothel joke, while stannis' influence on davos' grammar remains strong). lord varys was also annoyingly correct that the history books won't mention tyrion (boo!), although giving the book the obvious title was a bit cheesy, while tyrion has gone from the rebel in the small council dragging the chairs around, to the man leading a group of his own choosing.we had greyworm keeping his promise to missandei and heading to the beaches of naath, while arya, the girl who was once no one, sailed away proudly declaring she was a stark. we also saw a nod to how the iron throne is described in george r.r. martin's books when dany recalls what she'd heard about it, a possible appearance by hoyland reed at the dragonpit gathering, as well as a nod to martin's as-yet unwritten seventh book, a dream of spring, with the green shoot visible through the snow, as jon leaves the wall, as well as a mirror of how episode one began, as the gates of castle black rose to let him pass through. each one of these made the conclusion to the series more satisfying for me. feel free to point out all the ones i've missed!looking forward, by looking backwardsit's sad to end this post without being able to speculate on what will happen in the next episode. instead, we have a number of prequels in various stages of development to look forward to. they are all being made with hbo, so the production quality should remain and george r.r martin is involved too, in some more than others. we don't know much yet, other than the rumours that the first of these prequels to go in to production is going to look at the first long night. the casting for this series also has me hopeful, as it contains some of my favourite stage actors (especially denise gough, john heffernan). nothing can replace game of thrones for me in this world; the characters are just too special, but i'll certainly be tuning in.i might write a few posts reflecting on various aspects of the series, now that the story and the characters' journeys can be viewed as a whole, but for now, i'll end by saying, that despite my sadness that season eight was so short, when there was enough rich material to give us so much more, i'm satisfied with how the story ended. overall, it made sense to me, even the elements that i'd loved to have turned out differently (i'm looking at you jaime and dany). few shows grab my attention the way this one has (it was after season two that i read the books) and few stories have offered me so many incredibly complex and compelling characters to invest in emotionally. it'll be a series i return to many times in the future and it will undoubtably remain one of my favourites and for that i'm grateful to everyone who has had a hand in its creation."
2019-06-01,tushargupta-27286,"All season is good but season 7,&8 is boring",9,all season is very good but season 7& 8 is boring .all got fans not think finale season is good 😑😣😏
2013-05-08,reb-warrior,Afraid To Show Feelings,10,"please note, i haven't read the books.the series has well plotted out stories with political intrigue, warfare, and fantasy elements that spread far and wide through to many characters. not typical. the ones you think are the ""good guys"" don't always win. i feel like it's a war story where many different factions are fighting for control of everything, set in the context of a fantasy show.there are almost too many characters and stories. great if you read the books, and can read one right after another with no time,lag, but this show takes about a year before each next season airs. in the meantime, i forget whom some of the characters are, and what all the story- lines are. sorry, but i don't spend the downtime watching reruns over and over again. i have a life, bad memory and short attention span. perhaps i'm to blame, and yet i've seen many, many others say the same.the thing that really bugs me is that the characters don't show their emotions. afraid to show feelings! it's not the actors/actresses being subtle either. simply the way the characters are. many tell sad bitter stories of things that have happened in their past, but do it in a cold distant manner. tyrion does this. i like it. suits him. but all the characters are like that! it gets tiring.there are no epic love stories. no grand sweeping declarations of love, or expressions of overwhelming grief. romance is weak. so are the sex scenes. tepid. if you're going to have sex scenes on a premium cable network, make em hot!there are no delicious villains. i thought cersei might end up being a deliciously evil villain, but she ended up being just ho-hum. the acting: there is a mixture of stellar, to good acting, to some weak performances by some of the main actors.final thoughts: whom do i really care about? it's hard for me to watch and stick with a show if i don't care about anyone. i like tyrion, arya, and sort of like jon snow. but none, so-much-so, that i shout to myself: ""i love this character."" i am interested in seeing what happens with daenerys targaryen. there has been really good character development with her. i'd like to see how far she gets in her quest to take the throne. i can't say i love this character. frankly, i find her a little weird, and unfortunately, i find the actress playing her to be one of the weaker performers, which doesn't help. i'm writing this as of the middle of season three. i'm seriously thinking of dropping this from my watch list. yet i have a mild curiosity to see how things turn out. i admittedly would like the see the lannisters lose the kingdom. their dominance and ""getting away"" with everything is frustrating at times. yep, would definitely like to see them fall. i think this show must be wonderful for people whom have read the books. i'm happy for them. maybe someday i'll pick them up for a read, and my perception of the series will improve. 7/10"
2019-03-13,silverorlov,Hodor...,3,"many times heard and read in the internet about the beautiful series game of thrones. a lot of jokes, mems, theories. many times i heard that this is the best series because any character in it can die. so, it all turned out to be true. this series, like no other, has ever sunk into the poor behavior of the characters, except for some stupid, but tolerably cases. never seen a bad or excessive play of actors. the entire series consists of only 8,10 episodes in each season, but each episode costs more than the whole season of many other series with 20-25 episodes. beautiful music and ost's in general.

2019-05-16,silverorlov,Seven beauties and one monster,6,"seven seasons of the most excellent tv show i've ever seen. the plot, characters, atmosphere, dialogues, realism in all the topics that this series touched upon itself. i thought i had found the series, the only one that i can rate 10 out of 10 ...but then the 8th season came... and i don't want to describe my attitude during my viewing, otherwise i'll get banned on this site... this is what happens with art, which falls into the hands of mediocrity. this couple that managed the last season did not even hold the original books in their hands. they built the last season on the hype and the rating of the rest of the series, apparently in the hope that the audience will eat everything they throw into it's face. they sacrificed the essence of the series in favor of some spectacular scenes, but ruined everything else. i put the rating 10 to the first 7 seasons, and 5 to the last one(so if it were just an independent mini,series about some sort of medieval turmoil). sorrow, it was almost... almost!"
2019-04-22,evankevelson,Since The High Sparrow down from 9.5,1,"welcome to an attempted adult version of lotr...the southpark season 17 trilogy (parody of seasons 1,3). was on the ball...having read the books, i knew hbo would have to do some serious editing, but in 3 there were stories and details omitted that either needed to be since the story is very different from the books, or not to bombard the audience with too many characters. that aside since the slaughter of the wildlings, by stanis, they have expedited the threat of ""the long night"" while trying to maintain these political rifts, based on money the divine right's of kings etc..and only a handful of characters are around to want to ram their heads through the wall because the zombie apocalypse is on the door step and the last hope continue squabbling over a throne..
it's ridiculous, and cramming the destruction of humanity, or some surprise that prevents that from occurring, even in a fantasy universe is beyond realistic or possible. so everyone dies, or enough die before the zombies are stopped and then 3 episodes back to typical human infighting...that are 80 minutes long. i invested in the series so i'll finish, but i'm not going to justify my wasted time, by minimizing how korny, and ridiculous this show has become. it reminds me of the lost obsession...entertaining, suspenseful...then what happened..literally ridiculous.
it's rare that in a saga from beginning to end can one say it's phenomenal...
this is just a money maker...it doesn't come close to acting and writing to the sopranos..which had some below mediocre seasons and was up and down midway through 4..."
2019-05-20,evankevelson,Jumping the shark and fans refusing to admit it,7,"since parts of season 6, this has been simply put horrible. till the end of 5 i'd have given this 9/10 for story, effects and cinematography. the ending was just incredibly cheesy...
every character didn't evolve not the queen of dragons either as tyrion mentioned in the trial.
as far as the end and aegon jon snow targaryen...the rightful air...i couldn't see anything more ridiculous.
may as well have the drowned god resurrect theon.

2021-05-06,dk77dk,Great Start Catastrophic Ending,5,"a series that started so great and ended catastrophically badly.a story that was created over the years and a tension that grew only to end miserably.the cast is good, they portrayed the characters the best they could. peter dinklage is great in the role of tyrion lannister, and lena headey is excellent as cersei lannister.some parts of the show are really great, and the story is interesting and tense. the characters are interesting and layered, and the actors embodied them well.the cinematography is excellent as is the costume design. unfortunately, the ending is catastrophically bad and degrades the impression of the whole series.this is unfortunately a real example of how not to end a series, a real disappointment. in the end, it turned out that watching this show was a complete waste of time.another show that started great, only to be destroyed in the end by bad writing."
2015-06-28,maleplatypus,First five seasons the curve goes down,10,"what in the beginning has been a promising tv,show, with a rich story behind rich visuals became a feast of killing, perversions, ever so thinner story and predictable outcome. the producers obviously try to squeeze the last drop of milk from an exhausted cow. after killing so many characters, new emerge but without any reason or cause except transforming got into another lost. instead of answers, we got more questions. instead of coherent storyline, we got thousands of branches with no leaves and no ending in sight. i've watched all episodes at once, one after another, and it was still gets harder to follow. i could not imagine how it would be week after week. nothing to remember, nothing to link with anything. this is not a fantasy story any more, but randomly picturing someone's dirty mind/dreams in a form of a tv-show. however, the acting and direction (in such circumstances) is superb, although the characters are pretty one-dimensional (either good or bad) with no depth. if you endured so far, keep watching and hoping for better story development. if you did not watch any of got so far, don't bother. read the books."
2019-12-09,bhernandez2216,"Not bad GOT, not bad.",10,"game of thrones is a pretty good show so far on hbo, but not after what happened in season 8. season 1 to 7 is pretty good, cause of all the epic massive brutal battle scenes they show on television and all the beautiful women. but in the final season, it got low ratings at some point. i watched season 1 all the way to season 8, and it's not going well. except only one episode that's good for season 8 is episode 3. it had one epic battle, between the living and the dead. now that one is very good, but for 3 episodes 4 to 6... not so good like i thought it would. i guess they didn't do the way the novel was written. in the novel they did good with season 1 to 7, but in season 8 not so much."

2012-07-26,virindra,First season review.,8,"because of my nephew i started to watch the first season. this series is sometimes great and awesome, but most of the time boring. i am not an fan of movies that happened far in the past, except gladiator.there are a lot of thrones in this movie and a lot of people (actors and actresses) or characters who are well performed. for instance i like this peter dinklage, good actor, would have been a great add for the willow cast back in the days or be good next to hugh laurie in the remake of twins 1988. but the children of the kings are spoiled brats and start to come out my throat by now.sean bean was a good add to the series, but somehow he had to die. that was a surprise, like the series is full of it. but what it seems to lack is what direction we are going to. there is no direction for the viewer. everyone who you think that matters die and the ones you want to day stay alive. maybe that is also the strength of the series, because i am going to watch the second season for sure. i wonder how the second season evolves with dragons in it."
2019-10-23,mrpupkin,This is a great TV show from 1-5 seasons.,4,"the first 1,5 seasons are some of the best television ever created, there is a valid reason this show was such a cultural phenomenon, even if the last few seasons drop the ball, and the ball fell. and fell. and fell. and fell..the characters are compelling hooking you in like a serrated fishing hook. they're the biggest reason this show took off as it did. the writing is smart and clever, well-written characterisation and story, weaving together multiple stories and tons of charters seamlessly. the soundtrack is mind-blowing i mean holy.from intense action scores to quiet more ambient moments the music over-delivers, capturing feelings that other modern fantasy doesn't.the set pecies and effects are beyond convincing. to be fair, there are few outlandish establishing shots. but those there are (like the wall and king's landing) are so well done, shot in real locations in spain and scotland for its castle settings and iceland for it's more frozen moments. from the blood that would poor for a finger cut to a titanic wall of ice all is done so well that it never breaks any suspension of disbelif.conclusion: even if you're not a fantasy fan, i cannot recommend a show more. the hour-long episodes might seem daunting at first but they feel like 6 minutes when you start watching, wanting more and wishing for the show to never end. however, the last few seasons drop the ball. never from a technical level but from a writing level, no doubt you've probably heard of the criticism from season 7 & 8 where the season is at it's absolute worst. season 6 has it's bad moments and stories, but nothing compares to 7 & 8.
they fail to keep up with the realism of the fantasy series (weird thing to hear i know) as plot holes are more frequent here than anything i've ever watched. characters being flanderised and simplified so that they make stupid, outlandish decisions and the character complexity that was present is now all but gone. the show makes characters back peddle their arc's, they make characters have no purpose anymore, and they have this weird tendency to have the more popular characters be around for no reason at all, just to try to win more awards, all in service of the shadow of what this show was. but i'm sure when you get hooked from the first episode, you'll be excited and enthralled watching seasons 1-5 but lose that love as the show gets full of itself."
2021-04-22,ripcords,One of the best fantasy epics of all time,10,"with many overarching storylines and characters that come alive this is perhaps the best fantasy sword and sorcery series in television history. the ending song as bad (nor as good) as we would like, but in this series it is all about the journey. must see tv."
2017-10-16,namob-43673,"Greatest show for a while, but in total it is only really good",5,"got is a decent show the first season, then it becomes amazingly fantastic for a while, then pretty meh, then greatness and then we got season 7 which was average at best. in other words this show is hard to rate. this could, and should, have been the greatest tv show of all time, but a few bad episodes here and there, a very slow start and the latest season lower the score. sadly i have seen a bad development lately and this latest season where almost none of what made the show great there anymore. instead they put in another drive and americanized the show so things will move faster and action is now the key factor. this will likely get even worse moving towards the end with lightning speed. i am not even sure i will watch the coming season."
2020-11-12,drunken_munki,"Started well, ended very poorly",10,"season one is absolutely amazing. the costumes, settings, dialogue, and the plot. all are just wonderful to watch and soak in.season two drops the pace a little, and nothing great seems to occur. it moves on and sets up the next.season three is better and shows us new things, the scale gets bigger and some excellent events occur. the costumes and settings are still great, and the dialogue is excellent.season four is just epic. many top top episodes and events occur, things really get heated up and now the book material ends.season five is disappointing, illogical things start to happen; dialogue starts to get choppy and more modern. random events start to happen that kill off main story characters that should not be dead so early on.season six gets a little worse than five. the events make even less sense now and the show is starting to focus on propelling the actors careers forward instead of the characters and sensible events and decisions with consequences. more deaths of main characters that don't really make any sense.season seven is where the show takes an even more amazing turn to sacrifice characters plot arcs and instead give more action and cgi special effects. the season is an upper after the previous two, however.season eight. just terrible. poor story, poor characters, the cast seem miserable, nothing makes any sense. but it looks amazing; really it has some excellent effects and visuals. apart from that one episode that is almost pitch black. the story is now killed and the main characters such as brandon stark and john snow seem to be completely irrelevant to the plot. the final episode is the bigger let down in anything i've ever seen in my life.overall i give this show 6/10, as it got progressively worse and the final season is incredibly poor from a writing and storytelling point."
2019-05-09,eli_elvis,How to go from the best to the worst in 2 episodes.,5,"the show should be retitled to ""we have no idea what we are doing"". how stupid do you have to be to turn the best show ever made to the worst show ever made in under 2 episodes? just ask d&d. hbo really messed up, not only this show but their brand. i'll never buy a subscription again."
2017-07-25,heisenberg12,"Review of Season 1: High Production Value, but the Fantasy Genre Must Be Your Thing/Cup of Tea",9,"i'm a newcomer to the show. this is a pretty great show, but it has to be your cup of tea: the fantasy genre. it's ambitious and epic in scope, no doubt about it, but at the same time this is a niche genre that you must have interest in because it's very extreme in that nothing here is realistic. for me, i prefer realism, or at least shows that can be happening in the present day or recently.still, i can see how lots of people like this. i'm not one to hop on the bandwagon and follow the crowd, which is why i've just now caught up on season 1. i think many people just want to be in with the know of the pop culture relevance so they watched to keep up with friends' conversations; quite normal actually for hit shows.besides being total fantasy, another thing which bothered me was there are way too many characters to have to follow. i like shows that are more focused in tight and centralized around 1,3 characters. in summary, this show is like braveheart (setting, time period, accents) but with way more characters and a total work of fiction. i can see the praise it gets, but because the genre isn't my preference, it's not my favorite. i like realism. so far, it's pretty amazing and i'm impressed. i'll be back to modify my thoughts, however, as i catch up on proceeding seasons. 8.5/10"
2019-04-08,heisenberg12,"When you're honest and step away from the hype and wanting to fit in with all of the fans, you will see what is likely the most overrated television show of all-time",6,"writing, 7 (starts pretty great, but falls to embarrassing lows in s7 and declines in general after grrm left)acting- 7 ( most main actors are slightly above average and none are truly great, though many actors are ""average"")plot/story- 7 (becomes overly simplified and too far fetched for even a ""fantasy"" show by season 6-7, especially 7. the story ""drags"" out by seasons 6-7, so much so that it starts to lean more towards bad than good)characters- 6 (so overrated. this is probably the part of the show's popularity that baffles me the most. i honestly only really enjoyed 2 of the show's 40-50 main characters, and then there was a 3rd one i somewhat liked. everyone else is either forgettable or just okay. the show's main fans talk about all of these characters like they love them, and it's just perplexing since most are dull, boring, and mediocre.)costume design/set design/cgi/production values- 10. this is the one and only thing that is truly elite about the show, but it is without a doubt top notch. there is no denying that these are the categories where game of thrones truly excels and rises above most other shows. but that's like a typical cgi-laden hollywood comic book or sci fi action flick with a thin script and mediocre acting.all this said, is it good? yeah, it's good. in fact it is very good, but it is nowhere near the hype and over the top popularity it gets. the fandom for this show is somewhat unsettling. it's like nobody really expresses how they really feel about it. they all jump on the bandwagon and dare not anyone criticize the show because it's the best ever because all the obsessed fans say so so it must be true.meh. i like it, and i'll watch the final season, but i will definitely admit that half of the reason i'll be watching is just to continue to see how much of a decline in quality it has become since grrm left the writing team. the other half just wants to see how it ends, and if one of my predictions comes true, which if it does, i will be disappointed since it would be too predictable."
2014-05-12,son_of_cheese_messiah,A Game of two halves,9,"i'm very much in two minds about game of thrones. while i do not get the amount of hate we see here, i cannot share the enthusiasm that so many people seem to feel. up until season 3 when certain undesirable strains started to appear (see below) i found it watchable, although no masterpiece. by mid season 3 i did find it going downhill for the reasons below. things i like about got: 1. complex interwoven story,lines. george r.r. martin has cleverly assembled a number of stories designed to appeal to everyone. there's a little girl in disguise on a quest, a little cripple boy on a quest, a bastard son on a quest, a masculine woman on a quest, along with various royal pretenders seeking the throne. then there's the dwarf (of course!), the eunuch, the sadist pimp...the only thing missing is the effeminate male. 2. no concession made to the viewer. from the very start the viewer is thrown headlong into the story and expected to pick up on names, locations and family allegiances. certain ideas are mentioned in passing and then come to fruition episodes later without any recap given. this series demands careful viewing. 3. unpredictability. key characters are killed suddenly and unexpectedly without fanfare. 4. good scenery. 5. the imp. peter dinklage is the star of got. things i don't like about got 1.gratuitous nudity. these are the now notorious ""sexposition"" scenes where lengthy amounts of dialogue are delivered to shots of naked women. in the first series a certain amount of male nudity is also shown but this disappears in later series. 2.gratuitous swearing. sometimes, such as when a group of men are gathered together, the copious use of the c-word and other strong oaths seems appropriate, but in mixed company it does not ring true. 3. gratuitous violence. no so much a problem in the first 2 series but in scenes 3 a deeply unpleasant strain of ""torture porn"" begins to develop. 4. darkly lit. while this certainly makes got very moody, it is sometimes hard to see what is meant to be happening in the numerous night time scenes.5.increasingly predictable. after the surprising developments up the the middle of series 2, it has become a soap opera, with loads of sex and violence but little real danger (at least for the main characters).6. silly plot developments. this was the decisive factor in me turning against the series. some guy with a ""magic penis"", the warrior woman (who had been previously and admirably plausibly shown as being manly) turning into a sexy lady and worst of all, someone with the ability to bring back the dead, a development that makes me worry that some of the interesting things in previous series may be undone."
2019-05-14,dussaultjulien,"Sad that it had to end, but could you at least write a good story to end it with?",8,"after watching the first two episodes of season 8, excited it's not the word that i would use, ecstatic is best suited. the first two episodes were exciting, and engaging, the only real problem that i had with the first two episodes is that the second episode was so dark that you couldn't even see what was even going on, but we got the gist and moved on. i really do not like the fact that sansa could not keep her word to john, but again it was expected, what was not expected was daenerys targaryen's slow descent into madness, a slow descent that her father took, and she swore that she would not, but has done anyways. i really don't think that whatever the two brothers names are who created the tv series knew what they were doing with this ending. george rr martin gave you the keys to his kingdom, and do you have ruined it. danny is not some ruthless tyrant, in fact you've done a disservice to the character for even portraying her as one, she is not bitter towards innocent bystanders, or even people who have laid down their arms oh, she is a benevolent and kind queen, not some bitter jerk who decides to burn down the entire city just to prove a point to herself, that she is just as mad, bitter and deranged as her father was, that's the name mad king aerys. arya stark went from completely and totally knightlike, to total pansy in an instant. all because sand or put his hand on her shoulder and said do you really want to die? arya stark would have said not today, maisie williams would have been the one who truly ran away in fear. i have never been so disappointed in my entire life is somebody who is open,minded to new and different interpretations of stories. what a waste of a great series. what they don't realize is that all of us would have waited for martin to put out the winds of winter and a dance in spring so that the writers could actually have something to write around instead of come up with their own horrible ideas. to be honest i'm sure the george rr martin is ashamed, and he should be. if anybody should have crafted the last season it should have been him, the guy who freaking came up with the story not to dum dums who don't understand how to write a good, cohesive story that brings all perspectives together rather than separates them confuses them and destroys them. i will be watching the last episode, but i kind of don't want to. after seeing what they did in episode 5 i don't think that i would even want to bother watching the last episode, or even the spin-offs for that matter because if this is how they're going to be then i'm not interested. what happened to the character development? what happened to this well-rounded story? we would have waited for something better, in fact we waited 2 years for something better, and instead got something even worse than what we waited for. there is no reason to push something, when you can take your time and make it even better. that is the reason why this last season will fail. george rr martin takes so long to put out his books because he puts time and heart into every single page, these guys are just hacks who don't understand that concept, the only thing they understand is money."
2019-05-14,dussaultjulien,Why did they have to ruin it?,8,"the hound is dead, arya stark may as well be dead with her cowardice and downright stupidity, and game of thrones itself is dead with this last episode. it only took an hour and thirty something minutes to completely ruin what could have been a beautiful ending and a beautiful storyline. why would you make daenerys into what she has tried not to become so hard throughout the series in the end? why would you let arya stark abandon the hound to a horrible death at the hands of the mountain? for that matter, why would you kill theon greyjoy? why would you kill jamie, and cersei lannister in the way that they did? so many questions that will never be answered due to lazy writing, poor direction, and a total disregard for what george rr martin wrote, and built. there is a reason why every single time george rr martin puts out a book about game of thrones it sells well, he writes a well,thought-out, cohesive, and all-encompassing story that ties together beautifully, sometimes those thai take a book or two to come together completely, but at least they come together. what the, i can never remember their names, brothers have done to game of thrones is atrocious and downright disgusting and deplorable. they should be ashamed at what they have done. they made grey worm into a jerk and killed off misandry, they made euron greyjoy into a toned down, downright loser who doesn't even care about anything else but his own legacy, but can't even do anything, other than slay one dragon by surprise and kill jaime lannister only to be killed himself. the true crows eye would not be killed so easily. disappointment after disappointment until you are just begging for this show to end at this point. i'd rather see arya stark die then live to be the coward that she is, i'd rather see jon snow kill daenerys targaryen and take her place as the character that she was supposed to be. i don't understand how you can write that somebody would be so bitter about not wanting to have relations with somebody because they are related by blood that they would murder and burn innocent people, and soldiers who have laid down their arms. it blows my mind that this is how game of thrones is ending. george rr martin would be disappointed, and i hope to god that he is disappointed in the ending that these brothers have given us, because it is shameful. the only thing i have to say about this season is shame on you. shame on you all."
2021-01-01,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,One of the best shows but not a masterpiece,9,"it's one the only shows that i followed and kept up with every year. many people say the first 6 season are the best but i liked 7 and 8 even though they were been rushed it was still fun to watch. the only thing i strongly hated was the last episode of season 8. it left a really bad taste in my mouth. i felt betrayed at the time. the makers put a massive budget on the last season, made us wait 2 years to only give us this load of expensively man made poo. when i was done with season 8 it made me hate the entire series for a while. that's how badly the makers have messed season 8 up. but even though the last 2 seasons for most were a let down, you got to remember they still gave us 6 solid seasons which are still fun to watch today. all i can say now is to the people who haven't seen any of game of thrones. just try not to get to invested into this. save your selfs from a massive let down that could last for months after season 8."

Respect,7,"let's review the whole series backwards! even though i and many other were disappointed with the whole season 8, the ending was really great and unexpected for me! finally some writers who don't care about copying books and please book fans... they write the story they want to tell. that was a beautiful story full of courage, pain and love. i think everybody ended pretty much where they suppose to end... the whole journey was magnificent with dark plot twists, vendettas, fights, drama, love, sex and the directing was perfect! loved the little mystery and most of the performances and even though it wasn't as perfect as i wanted it to be i do understand that it is extremely difficult when you create something like this.. i hope you do too. enjoy the series and even though i wasn't a crazy fan and i know some of you are not, we'll see it again!"
2014-07-22,gogoschka-1,Fantasy has never seemed so real,8,"i don't believe there has ever been anything like 'game of thrones' on tv. the sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. the actors (and i mean really all the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make,up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make television-history. and the writing is just phenomenal.'game of thrones' may belong to the 'fantasy' genre, but the world of westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a tv-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. at the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. tyrion, cersei, dany, jamie and john (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for joffrey).there have been a couple of great tv-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale and quality, 'game of thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. a joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – television. 10 stars out of 10.lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
2011-04-21,perkypops,"Glossy, spectacular, but what about involving the viewer?",9,"i hope this gets better, and i am mindful that a) this comment is based on the first episode, b) i am in a minority, and c) it can only get better.firstly the opening sequence was riveting right up until the explanations and disposition. secondly most of the acting was fine, although the film hardly spent enough time on creating understandable characters and rather too much time spinning from location to location. and thirdly in my main beefs about this opening episode, the closing sequence was telegraphed.the translation of a story into screenplay is an art, especially so in the making of a tv series, where it is important to explore characters in such a way as to make you have feelings for them. this opening episode did none of that for me. i really didn't care. i was bored by dialogues which, like the opening sequence, promised so much but couldn't deliver. i really didn't care for anyone after this forty minutes or so.i do hope it gets better and i will watch episode two just to make sure i didn't see it on a off night (it would have been two off nights because i watched it twice just in case i'd missed something) but actually this is a case where the trailers are better than the real thing. here's hoping for a better part two."

2019-04-15,swordsnare,Unpopular Opinion,8,"starting watching this when this first aired, before everyone could not shut the hell up about it. i grew weary of it and lost interest after a number of seasons. i had forgotten what episode i had gotten up to as it all became increasingly frustrating.someone who had not watched this previously, could not do so without having some unrealistic expectations by the amount of over,hyping this gets. this would take 65+ hours straight binge watching to get up-to-date. i am so gloriously behind that i never, ever want to catch up.excellent production values and cinematography, etc. contrary to my opinion expressed above. alas, this show is not for me. this is just my opinion as unpopular as it maybe."
2020-02-07,overwatchgengi,The Greatest American TV Show of All Time,6,"game of thrones is peak fantasy crossed with the gritty horrors of the real world. heroes will die and villains will succeed, unfortunately the reality of our own world. game of thrones has dozens of plot crucial characters that are anywhere from favorable to the plot, to classic characters. game of thrones has mind blowing fantasy battles crossed with brutal medieval realism, making for one of the most real environments of any film or tv show. even though some complaints about season 8 are valid, i feel as if the season is overhated to a major degree as the first half of the season is phenomenal television. the second half may not be as great and is somewhat disappointing in some aspects, but a majority of characters and stories wrapped up perfectly for me. this is without a doubt a classic that will be looked at for decades to come."
2020-09-17,linda-plant2,ok in parts,10,"i watched the box set, as i would have lost interest quickly in the weekly episodes.peter dinklage made it worth watching. his delivery of his humorous dialogue with his sidekicks was priceless, and that voice of his ! amazing. (rather like the comic script between nucky thompson and his butler in the boardwalk empire).the concept is good, but some of the acting is diabolical, especially the younger members of the cast. it might have been maisie williams , arya stark, first acting job, and boy did it show, and sophie turner as sansa stark wasn't much better. it was embarrassing to watch them. definitely more acting lessons for the pair of them.other than that it was fun watching the different established actors taking part and wonder how long it would be before they were beheaded or stabbed.in essence it was just a medieval boardwalk empire - families wanting control of everyone else, lots of killing and plenty of sex and flesh on display. !!!!"

Season 8?,3,"i'll address season 8 at the end of this edited review from a month ago. benioff and weiss have created a virtuous medieval series. this series has outstanding direction, writing, special effects, custome, cinematography, settings, score and acting. the score plays just as an important role as the characters as it often sets the tone and mood for the scene as well as a foreshadowing of events to come. the entire cast deliver superlative performances. in particular harrington, dinklage, clarke, turner and coster,waldau are mesmerizing. based on martin's series of novels, ""a song of ice and fire"", the main plot revolves around two powerful families battling for control of the seven kingdoms and ultimately the iron throne. there are many subplots involved which add to the complexity and enthrallment with this series. the duplicity and betrayal among the different kingdoms as well as within the families vying for control also add to the mystery and intrigue throughout the series. there are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this series it's almost impossible for this viewer to choose one. the plot is gritty, violent, cunning, clever, duplicit, authentic, inventive, blazing, insightful, cathartic and captivating. if a reader decides to give it a whirl it is, in this viewer's opinion, imperative to start from the very first episode and enjoy the series from there. each and every episode is like a single piece in a masterful puzzle. as season 7 closes the most feared enemy of all, ""the dead"" march upon the wall not only threatening the rightful heir to the iron throne, but to the entire world as the characters know it. this series is a bravura work of art. it is unparalleled in it's genre both on television and film. it is memorable and will be for many years to follow. the final season just dropped and has this viewer more than elated. as far as the final season. i can understand viewers being disappointed. it was surely an enormous undertaking trying to bring complete closure to this masterful series while trying to maintain it's superiority in the genre and it's integrity. i myself felt like the aforementioned. however, i thought about two points. the first is at least hbo, benioff and weiss didn't make, ""got"" worldwide fanbase of millions wait 13 years to bring closure as was the case with, ""deadwood"" which as is to old west fans as ""got"" is to medieval fans. the second is that they did not drag the series out to an extent that could have given rise to a loss of the series' magnificence entirely. at least i was finally able not only to choose a favorite scene, but a complete episode which is in season 8, ep. 3. as cliche as it is, all good things must come to an end or in this case an ending."
2017-10-24,keelhaul-80856,"Good, but overrated, and a tiresome bandwagon show for millennials...",9,"i am giving this a 6, although overall, it is more of a 7 or 8, to balance the scales slightly.i enjoyed the first few seasons, though admittedly, this is really a show that everyone says is great and started watching,- simply because everyone else was already saying it was great and watching, and pop culture idolizes it now.i had never heard of george r.r.r.r.r.r.r. martin before the show, but apparently his books were known by some fantasy nerds. i love to read, but grew more into reading nonfiction than fiction, as i grew up. however, i actually write my own literature that has similarities to this, so i can sort of dig it.the good = good acting, beautiful scenery, brutal medieval war setting, interesting families/tribes interacting or killing each other for the throne. the bad= it took way too long to get to a major battle scene, although i am sure they have remedied that by now. in fact, the action is sometimes too far apart. when it does arrive, they started throwing in too much fantasy stuff, like resurrected snow people, monsters, dragons, witches, dudes with 60 faces, mammoths, etc. the show can't seem to decide if it wants to show gritty realism of human ordeals, or showcase a lord of the rings/star trek fantasy full of weird aliens and supernatural immortals. i think the show/books would have been better without all the fantasy hooplah-- or take the fantasy and actually create a unique world for it-- rather than stealing medieval europe and the romans and plastering monsters over it. the ugly= too many boring characters that people can't even keep up with. no one cares about boogers tardickio, or whoever-- the garbage man of king's landing(made-up, but there are way too many bozos that they throw in that add nothing). the blonde chick whining about slaves and dragons. she seems contradictory. the stupid red head witch manipulating stanis. the body double for lena heady's naked scenes. sex is great if it has a purpose, but most of the scenes are for gay dudes or just an excuse for people paying to have hbo, it seems. how is john snow still alive? they killed off ned stark too early. the little stark kids' journeys are incredibly boring. the lanisters always get what they want, and pay their debts. the giant lesbian-looking knight is like a pc announcement, but stupid. tons of people are fan boys of this show in 2017, that didn't even know what it was several years ago, when i was actively watching it, but now talk about it ad nauseam on social media.overall, a decent show, but overrated to the point of absurdity with newcomers(think minecraft for little kids), and i find myself bored at this point, no longer keeping up with it closely. i will wait for it to all be finished and come out later, when i can binge watch the whole thing."
2011-07-28,philthegreatone-786-63058,Great potential,10,"i have only watched two episodes of this show but i felt i needed to comment on it. it has great potential the second episode was far superior to the pilot. the show looks great, the acting is solid and this show could pull off a surprise at the emmy's this year.it could take best drama series, although i do need to watch all ten episodes before i can really say whether it deserves it or not.sean bean is probably the best actor in this show. i also like lena headly a lot. i loved her in terminator:sarah conner chronicles and 300 she is very sexy and a solid actress. as always with hbo there are some sex scenes which are interesting and not exploitative. i am looking forward to watching the rest of season 1"
2020-01-06,mamadnobari97,To people who say just because of ending is bad doesn't mean the whole show is bad...,1,"ending is everything to a show or a movie, if you end it in this idiotic way and ruin every character building you've done over 6 seasons, it'll ruin the whole series and leave a bad taste in your mouth. it's like eating a lot of chocolate and then you take a bite of a piece of doo doo, yeah it was fun eating the chocolate and it tasted very good, but what you remember and taste forever is the doo doo you ate after those.
and giving it an 8 is a generous rating considering the mentally rorted writing of the last 2 or even 3 seasons."
2012-10-18,michael_the_nermal,Well-Done Fantasy Series. A Dramatic Tour-de-Force!,1,"warning! plot spoilers ahead!this review will only be for the first season of the program, as i haven't yet seen any of the second season episodes; that being said, i think it's fair to review the series based on what i have seen only from the first season.of late, hbo has scored a sting of victories in the eyes of viewers and critics alike with their original series. if ""game of thrones"" is typical of the hbo original series, then the channel is well worth the premium cost for cable subscribers. ""game of thrones"" succeeds mostly because of its three,dimensional and engaging characters, dark themes, and riveting plot line; the fantasy setting, in my view, is incidental to the series' success, but it is not entirely irrelevant, as the setting provides a framework for an exciting plot involving murder, betrayal, and byzantine court intrigues and power struggles.the series is based on a series of fantasy novels that seem inspired by ""the lord of the rings"" and the general mythos of middle-earth, but is far more naturalistic in style than tolkien's works (for example, the ""game of thrones"" series involves graphic sex and violence, coupled with a grim and cynical tone missing from the more optimistic story presented in ""lord of the rings""). the setting is located in a fictional world based closely on medieval europe, and the first season storyline centers around a feudal lord named eddard stark. lord stark acts as the adviser to an ineffectual king, and is presented with a conflict that forces him to choose between an honorable and ethical course of action, or more pragmatic choices which are not in themselves ethical. the tragic flaw of lord stark--which i have read from other online comments about the series-- is his blind allegiance to honor and morality over pragmatism. stark will invariably follow his conscience in every decision he makes, without viewing the the bigger picture. while lord stark thinks he is in the right with his course of action, he unthinkingly steers the kingdom into a disastrous course of events in the long run. this classic irony speaks well of the intelligence behind the creation of the ""game of thrones"" series. not all viewers will appreciate the dark and cynical themes present in the series, two of which seem to be that ""sometimes the ends justify the means"" and ""good men are no match for those who place power above morality and justice"". nevertheless, many viewers will nonetheless be moved by the tragedy of the series' main protagonist; while i am not going so far as to claim ""game of thrones"" is great literature, the series works because, it, like great works of literature, engages the audience with the believable and palpable tragedy of a powerful protagonist. other characters also prove compelling, the most notable of whom is the cunning and witty tyrion lannister, a member of a rival noble house. also known as ""the imp"" (both for his diminutive stature and his wily demeanor), this character, who is able to use his silver tongue to persuade other characters to get him out of unfavorable situations, has become a fan favorite, and rightfully so. peter dinklage, the actor playing tyrion, breathes life into a character who is able to overcome his status as an outsider in a discriminatory feudal society and become a key player in the politics of the kingdom. while tyrion's family is defined by their amoral lust for power, tyrion, while far from being pure-hearted, does seem to abide by a personal code of ethics and morals, although he is much more pragmatic and less rigidly bound by this code than lord stark. not everything about the series is worth praising. while the screenwriters aim for a paradoxically realistic approach in a fantasy setting, they sometimes take it too far with gratuitous t & a (a feature of which many hbo shows are guilty). i understand why some reviewers were disgusted with the excessive amount of graphic sex, nudity and violence displayed on the show, much of which is not necessary to furthering the plot, and seems to be there only to titillate the audience. unlike ""harry potter"" or even ""lord of the rings"", ""game of thrones"" is definitely not a fantasy series the whole family can enjoy. i would go so far as to say that the soft-core sex detracts from the mature themes and brilliantly-crafted tragedy present in the story.my misgivings about the sex and violence in the series notwithstanding, i find ""game of thrones"" to be a quality work of art, an exception to the banal reality shows proliferating television today. i hope hbo keeps ""game of thrones"" running for years to come."
2019-03-06,csm-78119,The best thing on tv over the last 10 years marred only by its last two episodes,9,"a spectacular series that has provided some of the most gripping and awe inspiring tv of recent years. great performances all round. as a viewer you feel at times that you have been a surrogate member of the stark family as you move from one season to the next. 4 or 5 different but linked stories in one , each as enthralling as the next, though jon snows adventures at the wall are the heart of it all. kit harrington is excellent in that role. peter dinklage brings tyrion to life in spectacular fashion and emilia clarke is stunning as daenerys. it feels as if their characters were written for them. how good too are maisie williams as arya; john bradley as sam; lena headey as cersei and nikolaj coster-waldau as jaime? you could literally go through the whole central cast without finding fault. dianna rigg and charles dance perhaps two more to highlight. this could all have easily been a let down from martin's original books but the tv production even surpassed those until its penultimate episode. sadly we needed at least 2 or 3 more episodes in that final season before that episode for it to make any sense. the final episode rescued it to some extent but that too was marred by too little time left. its such a shame that the producers decided to rush through the conclusion to what would otherwise have been simply perfect tv. still well worth an investment of 75 or so hours of your time!"
2015-08-18,pontram,The Game is Losing its Throne,10,"at first i have to say that i did not read read any of mr. martin's books, and that i watched all five seasons. and, that i do not find this show over,sexed or especially brutal. i do not live in a country where nudity on screen is a problem. yet graphic violence is, but except in some cases (mostly boring scenes), i never felt the need to fast forward.i enjoyed the first four seasons of got (with no real understanding of the hype around it) until the death of oberyn martell. the characters were mostly interesting (except that girl that has only two facial expressions, daenerys), the story arcs wide and interesting, and the dialogs, precisely most of them with tyrion involved, razor sharp like no other show i watched before.got is basically a family story, and it takes most of its fascination from there. powerful and powerless families are put together, with their history background lasting over centuries. they are stuck in their age, struggling for survival and power. the game of thrones itself seems as a permanent repeated game of success, failure, loss, intrigue, murder, war and humiliation, as history presents itself to us. people want power, are trying to take it like wolves from their rivals, are succeeding or failing while the only real sure outcome are mountains of dead bodies. it's basically shakespeare and doesn't add anything to his observations of the human nature, except a bit of tolkien or rowlings and nietzsche. we are allowed to like that (or not).back to oberyn. just when the got producers had the luck to bring in another intriguing character - actor pedro pascal had the role of his life - they decided to kill him. ok, i have not a very big problem with killing a character, but in this case it was pure waste. tywin's death actually did make sense, for example, and however we liked charles dance, he had to leave eventually.next, there was the death or disappearance of sandor clegane. this character had vast potential and was wasted, too.together with some other needless things, like the torture and depenitation of theon greyjoy, got then lost parts of its central themes, particularly the game itself, and the family saga aspects, to be a simple series of events, failures and not very interesting stories of fates (sansa, arya, brienne)i put the blame for got's current (season 5) downfall as a reasonable epic equally on both r.r. martin, the original author, who lost track of his own creation, and the producers of the the series, who didn't see that their child has to grow up and eventually has to go loose from the author, who cannot handle the complexity anymore and therefore makes the wrong decisions to hold it together."
2020-02-12,fkdz,Heartbroken..,10,"i mean what do you do at this point, its a 8 season show but they decimated the last 2 and ruined just so much.but then season 1,6... sure the 5,6 weren't perfect but they still had me hooked and i still loved them! for a show that encapsulated me and dragged me into this fantastic world for 80% of it i can't rate it lower than a 8... but with a huge sidenote like i mentioned..but how can a show still be good if it's last 2 seasons ruined multi season arcs? everytime i find myself talking about the show i'm get a little angry, or agitated, knowing that if i decide to rewatch it, many of the arcs will be ruined + the finale, so in reality the show can only be rewatched for 4, max 6 seasons, but ending with huge ''cliffhangers''.i guess it's just disappointing and that's what makes me frustrated, such an intricate and epic story rushed to finish like a bad high school paper.8/10, whilst it was 10/10 at the end of s6.and regarding recommending people to watch the show.. it's tough, telling them to leave it at s6 knowing that it's a massive cliffhanger doesn't feel great either."
2019-11-29,chiumt,A Medieval Masterpiece,8,i finished watching all 8 seasons of the series. it would be difficult to find a series that can stand up to got. i think it is a masterpiece. watch to the end. the twists and turns keep coming. all the conflicts are finally resolved. who is going to finally sit on the iron throne?
2014-05-02,bricknash,Fantastic first season but losing interest due to character deaths and scattered story lines.,4,"having got myself right up to date with got with a megabinge and finishing on, what is currently season 4 episode 4 i feel there is enough within 3 and a bit seasons to give it a fair review, but.....for a series that is still going it can only be a review of what it is ""so far!"" and not as whole because who knows what will come next.first up, season 1....magnificent, glorious, stunning, original, daring, explicit, all these words and more i could pour into the season 1 cup and it would not have room for the rest. every episode is absolutely gripping and you are dying to find out what happens next. all acting is superb and bettered only by the mind blowing production values (seriously, i have seen hollywood feature films with cinematography and visual effects that aren't this good!) and thoroughly mesmerising scripts. make no mistake, this is no harry potter, or even lord of the rings and it is absolute not for children! the gore is shockingly ott and the sexuality, constant full frontal nudity and the harshest of expletives makes for a very adult series indeed but this time it has the drama and stories to fully back it up.seasons 2 and 3 unfortunately sort of meld in with each other and here's where the cracks start to appear and......well you know why really but we'll get to that later.*spoilers*for a start the shocking end to season 1 sees the young son rob march to war for revenge. this march takes over 2 seasons and he never actually gets there and by that time i lost interest in his cause and had to actually remember why he was doing it in the first place. the programme becomes a mish mash of crossed stories following characters around different parts of the world, some i really liked and wished they'd focused on and some i just couldn't have cared less about.of course the biggest flop for me is the repeated killing off of lead characters. this has been a heated subject on the internet and i am afraid i am on the team that thinks negatively of this. once was shocking in a good and bad way and really kept you on your toes. twice, was a little annoying but by the end of the third season there were precious little characters left that i cared about. i know g.r.r. martin has said he does it for shock value and to be unpredictable which is fine but if you kill off the people that viewers wast to know more about it's also an interest killer too and in that i could feel it happening to me as the cast numbers dwindled. call me old fashioned but the real world has enough bad people getting away with killing good ones so i like my fantasy a little less grim than that and more heroic. of course i applaud the rick that has been taken but as i say it's been done a bit too often now and is becoming dangerous to the story.there is still much to watch though, the wonderful arya stark branch of the story is amazingly well acted and there is still much to be seen in the stormborn, section of the tale as is the ever watchable peter dinklage as the imp. alas the rest just isn't very interesting. bran stark's tale is a slow and boring one, jon snow's is par at best and there is just far too many separate stories going on to get your teeth into and care about.i can't blame the makers of the tv series though, everything has remained at super high quality throughout and even with the flaws they have managed to keep it watchable but still, they had better be careful with mr martin as although he has the perfect right to do with his characters as he chooses it might seriously make some viewers lose interest if he keeps killing off the interest points for the sake of shock.that's it so far, the series could get better or worse but we shall have to wait and see!"
2019-07-17,snowfre,An epic of Odyssey of fantasy and political drama.,2,"the existence of hbo's monster hit ""game of thrones"" just can't have passed by anyone without them noticing. and deservingly so, it's a spider web of political intrigues, love drama, and action. add to that breathtaking cinematography and incredible acting from its large ensemble. following the many characters, from the starks in the north, to cersei in king's landing, ""got"" brings you some of the best television ever. even though it spiraled down somewhat halfway through season seven to end on a pretty ""meh"",note in the last one, mainly due to several character arcs being seemingly washed off the surface of westeros, ""got"" is a beautiful tv show i recommend everyone."
2019-04-13,diggnuts,Enjoyable escapism from an unlikely source.,1,"the true miracle of this series is how the producers created a somewhat coherent viewing experience giving the paltry, prolix ridden, source material. of course the main story arc suffers from the same problem the majority of modern serialized productions suffer from, in that the massively stretched arc is inherently flaccid, obvious and completely dependent on obscurity and plot twists to remain somewhat a recognizable plot.luckily, unlike the books that read like a poor mans tolkien (if tolkien was a semi,literate screenwriting, plagiarizing historical narratives and putting dragons in them), the character development in the show is pretty solid and enjoyable up until they get killed off of course.so regardless of the coming inevitable unsatisfying and underwhelming ending of the main story arc, as a collection of character arcs, got is certainly interesting mindless escapism."
2012-05-04,plasticanimalz,Amazing,10,"we had the hbo screener copy sitting around for months with no interest in watching it. we weren't sure what to make of it but i'm used to seeing the terrible mini,series set in medieval times attempts on television, so i was weary of got. we ran out of things to watch and so popped in the first 2 episode that came on the emmy screener copy and we were blown away, and bummed there were only two episodes on it. i've stopped watching it so i can read the books, which are also amazing and page turners. this isn't a genre i would normally enjoy reading but it's so well written that i'm really into it. also, knowing what's going on in the series helped me understand what is going on in the book. it's very detailed, in an almost jane austin kind of way and uses words we don't use in modern time, not to mention, a lot of character names that aren't very modern, so it takes a bit of thinking in the beginning to catch up and understand what is going on. but you get used to it pretty quickly and then it just flows. i would highly recommend this for anyone. my dad likes crime novels but i plan on giving him a copy of the book because i'm pretty sure he would like this. would it be blasphemy to say it's as well written as 'the hobbit?' sorry, it's just really well written and a gorgeous and epic show, and as good as production value in any movie. a must see and a must read."
2018-07-12,faisalfaves,"Nice Show, But Sorry never come close to Breaking Bad.",6,"it's a nice show, it has it's own taste, but when people say that it is the best show in the history of television, i feel to punch them on their face. it is a good show, even amazing, but sorry it is not near and never come close to breaking bad.if you are a fan of got, then start watching breaking bad, until the last episode of breaking bad, you will never watch got."
2018-08-01,faisalfaves,"it's a good series, but not above than Breaking Bad",10,"it's a good show but it's too much slow, even people who love game of thrones more than anything else still felt boring during some of these episodes. i like it but not more than breaking bad, i'll tell you why because it's too slow, they stretch story too much. for example in season 2 jon snow dragging that girl in the whole episodes and there are more scenes like this one. there is less than half thrill if you compare it with breaking bad. it's about opinions, you should watch it if you haven't yet."
2020-07-13,comps-784-38265,"Great start, addictive series, disasterous ending",9,"when i first saw game of thrones it seemed very confusing , stories jump from one character, then to another, then to another.steadily you get sucked into the intrigue, subplots and general machinations of those competing for power and the unscrupulous violence, murder and light pornography, that is game of thrones.you become an addict.this is the mark of great story telling (by george rr martin) you enter the world he created and become absorbed.then the story is handed over to buffoons to end.it's like a great artist starting the mona lisa, then leaving her face to be completed by a chimp with a 4 inch paint brush, liberally loaded with bright red paint and advertising it as a 'masterpiece'.the transition from a world created by a master story teller, which literally took years of building up characters, hints, and subplots and possibilities. that created a following of millions of avid fans waiting for the finale.lurches to the crude, clumsy, train crash of a finale, by writers who clearly do not deserve the title.all they could do was use the facade of the world created by george rr martin then turn it to dross ."
2019-08-04,yasir619,You should watch GOT once in your lifetime if you want to see masterpiece.,10,"i am totally disappointed and totally sad for the season 08, because this is what that has broke the million people's heart, i know there are millions of fans of got so am i. when i started to watch got from season one to season 7, it was just going amazing and utterly mind blowing for me, it's class and value is totally worthwhile to watch, i was going to rate this 10/10 for many reasons but i am rating this 9/10 for one authentic reason and you are pretty aware of that, season 08. totally pathetic and full of underwhelming that you can't expect such conclusion from this kind of tv show that it's past season was the best seasons you had seen in your entire life but what is in season 08 is not acceptable for the fans of got. got is the tv show that i will never ever forget because of it's outstanding storylines and thrilling.let me talk about the cast for what they have performed in this masterpiece:the characters, sets, places, peoples, visuals, plots, and the most important strategies. let me gossip about the first man peter dinklage aka tyrion lannister, while watching this gentleman in this show i wasn't considering me as a dwarf, he is the man from which i have gained a lot of inspiration for his outstanding and astonishing acting, they way he talked and made plans through his clever mind it genuinely left me speechless, he is the most finest man i have ever seen on this planet, i will never forget this man. jon snow aka kit harington, what a great acting of this man, his facial impression are brilliant and there are no words to define him. emilia clarke aka daenerys targaryen, she is powerful woman of this episode, i am out of words for her acting, she is best at valyrian language and she looked awesome. jamie lannister aka nikolaj coster,waldau, i hated him at the very beginning but started to love him in just 3rd or in 4th season, he became kind and honest and i loved it the most, there are other characters like cersei lannister, arya stark, sansa, bran, the hound, podrick, ser davos, jofferey, tommen, brienne, lord varys, khal drogo, theon greyjou and his sister,grey worm, and there are so many fabulous characters that i can't write here but they are all the best one believe me.hoping great spin offs of got which would be same stunning as got."
2020-04-04,poiguy,"High budget, high quality, exciting fantasy series",1,"it is very rare you will find a show with theatrical level of action, drama, and storytelling. after watching game of thrones, i can tell tons of time and effort was put into this show. the characters, the storytelling, the action, the drama, everything is so well done. certain episodes like battle of the bastards and the spoils of war were some of the most thrilling tv of all time!i loved watching characters like arya grow up and succeed in life. this show makes you really care about everyone. i love the hound and his struggle with his brother. jon snow and the other starks are wonderful protagonists. the character development is unmatched by any other show.season 1,7 are damn near perfect. i liked season 8 but the ending did kind of flop, especially the final episode. it was rushed, certain characters had horrible endings (daneryas), and many story-lines were left unresolved. it wasn't the best season but not enough to lower my rating to a 9.it's really worth a watch if you're into fantasy series! the last season is a letdown but still worth the watch."
2019-07-17,nightmarelogic,One of the most overrated overhyped shows ever made,3,ok maybe game of thrones doesn't deserve a one star. i would give it more a 5 but with all the people gushing over it and all the awards it seems to get nominated for over much much much better shows i want to down vote it. there is no way it should get two spots for supporting actor and actress each season. not when other shows put out seller work. that is my major gripe. this show at its best is fun entertainment with great special fx. at its worst it is depressing (mor depressing then that suiciide scene that netflix is removing from 13 reasons why) over exaggerated drama. the dragons are cool though.
2016-05-03,grumpy-3,"enough already, with this game of bores",6,"like most american series, this has now gone on long enough, it was ok for maybe the first couple of seasons, by season three it had begun to fade, more dialogue, more characters that come and go and with no end in sight. it is now a game of bores,i don't really care about anyone, just like battlestar galactica, this is liked by people who normally would run a mile from fantasy, as with galactica this is really a soap opera with locations and costumes, the fantasy elements virtually gone, with galactica there was no sci fi but just boring soap scenarios. the fact that the author cannot find a way to end this says a lot, as with soaps again there are no endings just stuff that goes on and on and on and on. this not shakespearen nor does it say much about the human condition, there is nothing we have not seen before, done a whole lot better"
2019-05-12,xiaohei-80112,John wick is coming for John snow,9,"want to give a rating of 10, but the season 8 episode 3 really disappointing me so much. my pervious eyes pupil enlarge so much that trying to see the fight scene clearly in dark snow battle field. from season 1, writer create a powerful image of white walker, and in night king being kill so easily in just one episode. many lazy writing in session 8, but so far the rest of the season still like it, so give a rating of 9."
2018-09-06,michael-561-692892,The best show ever produced on cable TV,10,"the story is incredibly enveloping. the score has become as recognizable as the theme for star wars, indiana jones and the like. the locations, the wardrobe... all spot on. the disregard for sexist visual censorship giving way to finally showing dong on tv. it's about time hbo! this show is a winner and the only negative is that winter has finally come. i wish there were another 4 seasons but we are left with the sad truth that the white walkers are here."
2021-05-18,hoernkeem,"Game of Thrones (2011, HBO)",10,"season 1: first season puts this show on path to perfection it is hard to overstate, at this point, the importance, the dominance and the sheer impact on the landscape of television of 'game of thrones'. back in 2011, however, when it first debuted it was far from a sure thing. there is a book out now that talks about the lost got pilot that was so hokey and problematic that they completely reshot the entire thing. highbrow, high profile fantasy, whether it be movies or television, has always been a roll of the dice. these enterprises either break very good or very bad and there is not a lot of in between. everything that would be 'game of thrones' hinged on this first season. working off george r. r. martin's extremely well thought out, well crafted and extremely detailed source material benioff and weiss created one of the best shows of all time. it gained a lot of attention predominantly for its gratuitous violence and nudity. while throughout the 8 seasons the violence never really lessens the nudity certainly calms down. i think early on it functioned more as a gimmick to get the curious to tune in only to note that the show was pretty damn good and by midway through the show's run they didn't really need the gimmick anymore plus most of the actresses were at a level of fame that precluded them from having to bare all.the showrunners and writers had an incredible job to do as the source material is very dense and they are cramming a lot of content into 10 hour long episodes (at least for the first 6 seasons). the first season is responsible for introducing a lot of the major concepts and where the story stands as well as all of the primary players, and there are quite a few and a good amount of faith is left to an intelligent audience to absorb it all. the primary story has to do with who sits on the iron throne and rules as the king of the seven kingdoms of the fictional continent of westeros. when we enter the story robert baratheon sits on the throne. he is not really a bad ruler, but is more concerned with wine, women and hunting than being a good, decent ruler. we are introduced to the four primary families of concern regarding the iron throne: the baratheons, the starks, the lannisters and the targaryens. the starks are nominally the protagonists although we would come to find out over the course of the show that good and bad are somewhat malleable concepts. about halfway through the season robert baratheon is killed on hunt gored by a bore and basically all hell breaks loose as the subsequent struggle for the iron throne sets the stage for the rest of the show's run. there are a myriad of other stories, but that story is most dominant and primary. it becomes common knowledge that all of robert's issue who have been given to him by wife cersei lannister are really the product of incest between her and her brother jamie. while joffrey baratheon is installed by the lannisters as king, robert's brothers do not recognize that and commence to making war for the throne. meanwhile the targaryens who ruled before robert have long planned to retake the iron throne. and in the north the eldest stark son is about to start a war as bastard stark son jon snow heads north to a wall that spans from coast to coast where the night's watch, made up of societal rejects, take a lifetime oath to guard the realms of men from what lies beyond the wall.got has another key aspect that makes it one of the most pivotal shows ever, and that surrounds a story that is unafraid to dispatch anyone at anytime. this show lays waste to character after character in some of the most jaw dropping eye popping, memorable scenes ever. the ten best moments in got can be ranked up there with some of the ten best moments in television, period, and it all starts with the original no one is safe moment; the beheading of ned stark who was the closest thing to a moral compass the show had as well as the closest thing to a protagonist. he was beheaded at the behest of an insolent, self righteous, cruel preteen king joffrey who is shocking mostly by the fact that he is not the worst person we meet on this show. this character exit still remains one of the most shocking and awe inspiring in the history of television and it set a standard that got would adhere to for most of its run. while the ned stark beheading takes the cake for moment of the season if not the entire show i will give extreme kudos to viserys receiving his crown of gold as well as daenerys becoming the unburnt mother of dragons to close the season.got has some amazing source material that is adapted very well by producer/writers benioff & weiss. it has a great cast of mostly unknowns at the time with a few exceptions and has a production value to actually give the entire thing credibility. if any one of these areas lacked the whole thing would spin out of control but with each section firing on all cylinders plus a solid direction it really allowed this first season to function as a great launching pad for what is arguably one of the greatest television shows of all time.eric's grade , season one: a."
2019-05-26,andrew-hill515,Rating lowered,8,"this show was a 10. then they ran out of source material and the writers ballsed it up.
for example, they periodically made people dumb for plot reasons, applied plot armour, made things happen for no reason other than shock value (instead of reasons or decisions or consequences).
also, people started teleporting all over the place, character development was forgotten about, world,building abandoned, plotlines and foreshadowing dumped without reason.
things no longer had to have a reason to occur, only that they be shocking or surprising.
the show stopped being about politics, and personal drama, and underhanded actions, and instead became an action show, removing anything that needed any thought, just action and action and shocks, with locations and the politics and personalities being afterthoughts if they were included.
then season 8 happened.
admittedly, everyone involved in season 8 was fantastic, the cast, the crew, every element of the show was beautifully done. everyone involved in the show for this season should absolutely be proud of their amazing work... except the script writers. who were bad at their jobs.
unfortunately, no matter how well made and acted a show is (and it was brilliantly made and acted) if it's in service of an incompetently written script, then the writers do a disservice to everyone else. and the writers truly let down the show by not letting someone competent do the writing.
the last season of the show just seemed to be written by lazy writers who just wanted to finish up so they could go ruin star wars.
i left it as an 8/10, down from the 10/10 it used to be, because every aspect of the show was fantastic, and it was only let down by the writing after there was no more source material to adapt.
plus, hasn't cersei being pregnant (and it was confirmed in interviews with the show runners that she was) been a thing to try and humanise her for like a year and a half in the show's chronology? she's not even showing yet.
alternatively, if she was only a month or two along and everything in between took place in a month or two, then horses and ships and walking in westeros must be really fast, and the characters age really fast, considering the amount of travelling that took place between the pregnancy being announced and the end of the show.
especially considering jamie went from kings landing (where the impregnating happened) to high garden (i think he went there after, but it was a while ago so that might be wrong) to kings landing to winterfell, fought in a war, moved in with ser brienne of tarth, a time jump where they were serious (i think, it wasn't clear), and back to kings landing before cersei had a baby bump."
2019-10-17,imdbmoviereviews,boring over rated overblown... poor story telling simply meehee...,10,"right from the start you can see how the series gets things in a slow way while with good acting setting cast everything about how the series look is great the story simply goes no where... sure a few plot twists and... without giving spoilers and yet it's pretty expectable...
the story lines seems good on paper... it feels like a check list movie... where the writers had a check list with how many plot twists and kills and... they wanted and shaped around it the series.... it's simply boring......
there no art in it no passion no nothing...it's like listening to poetry from a poet that simply speaks to you the poet... it's dull... lacks meaning/....... that's not to say there isn't drama/... but it's all buried up in so much snit that it's simply not worth to watch if you'd ask me...
the all interesting parts of the series and the story can fit in anywhere from 20 minutes to a hour....the rest simply fills it up.... and ye it's very much boring....
do i suggest u watch it no... but it is pretty popular so why not see if you'd like it
but be ware that it's simply over rated...if your looking for very good writing try watching avatar (the animated one...)or series like that
you'd see how different this things feel while it can be hard o place one's hand on it some times... u can see that even a animated series with much much less violence and death and graphics and....... is a lot more exiting and interesting because the story was done right...
(it's amazing how can 1 fill the series so much violance and drama... into a series and still make it boring)
poor story telling that's it... that's the point"
2011-04-21,trans_mauro,Boooooooooring,10,"game of thrones clearly has good production values, good acting and beautiful women. but the story (or the script) is a potent sleep inducer. after watching this show for 30 minutes i could not care less who was who, what are their plans, and etc. these tales of intrigue and high drama mixed with stereotypical notions of bravery, deception, honor, treason, loyalty, royal lineage etc. are so passé that one wonders why people keep on making films and writing books about them. not to mention that reading and hearing about kings and queens and all this nonsense has become a chore. how many films and book have been written based on this quasi,medieval quasi-mythical ideals?that is why lately there are always some naked skin, exposed breasts, rough-sex scenes (e.g. spartacus) on these productions. the directors need to get the attention of the viewer, right? otherwise, people would simply turn to other things which are a little bit less dull, confusing and uninteresting.can't those guys create more interesting alternative realities? does it always have to be about power, murder and sex? all in all, this type of tale is nothing more than a medieval version of dallas....yep, you've seen one, you've seen them all!"
2019-08-28,droog-56936,"""Give Me Back My Show!""",10,two seasons ago i would have given this thing a full 10 but then came season 7 and it whittled down to a 8...and then came the horrid abomination that was season 8...now it's a 7! where does one even begin? the weakening soyness of jon snow...the sudden weird schizo shift of daenerys...strangeshifts in character personalities and motivations...this will certainly leave you screaming at a dragon for no apparent reason. 10 for the first 6 seasons minus 3 for the last two
2021-08-18,bhester0806,Watch the first 4 season and call it there,10,"this show was a cultural phenomenon and it dropped off the face of the earth over night basically because of how horrible the ending was. d and d should have been arrested and charged with something for the way they screwed this show up.the first 4 season are pure perfection and some of the best television ever made giving the sopranos and breaking bad a run for their money.then season 5,6-7 the quality of story telling and the way the characters are written starts to slide.then the infamous season 8 that they made us wait two years for takes a header off mount doom taking one of the best shows ever made with it leaving behind only fragments of what could have been.i guess it's still worth a watch but know you will be disappointed, 3/4ths of the story line and lore that's built over 7 season will have no pay off or bearing on the end of the show.this is the greatest tragedy in the history of television simply put."
2017-07-10,yashrajs536,One of the best TV Shows !!,3,"g.o.t. is really a television treat to the viewers. before i was used to watch superhero tv shows of wb and marvel. and i admired how much hard work they have done and also how much money they have put into it. so that the viewers can get a phenomenal experience.but g.o.t. changed my perceptions. it is so awesome and beautiful that a viewed can stick to it for a whole 1 hour. this serial has exceeded others in terms of budget , quality and entertainment. as a result it is the most watched tv show. the costumes , vfx , filming sets are beyond imagination and out of this world. and the actors too are doing full justice to there respective roles.i usually don't write reviews on serials and movies. but this show is so intriguing that i have to write a review to appreciate it. it's concepts and it's story and most importantly there way of presenting this concept is exceptional. i am even out of words right now. i love almost each and everything of this show. i am an ardent supporter of this series. and i am really waiting very badly for the 7th season. hope it doesn't ends on that."

2020-06-25,valentinionut,"it is a story, a tale for you",10,"sansa and arya played baelish in winterfel almost from the start. all we see is plot for baelish.tyrion talks to daenerys about jon snow and says snow hates lannister just as much as her because they killed his father (daenerys s father was killed also by the l.) and ploted to kill his brother (daenerys ploted to kill her own brother! one can say). red flag here.grey worm did not killed jon because being trapped in a ruined city with tens of thousand of dead men means plague, pandemic if you want. also, the other army will kil them for sure. most imp. maybe is that that he knows jon loved daenerys and had to sacrifice her because ...killing people. grey worm started the massacre because his love was killed. he clearly was in the wrong.jaime s best thing it s his light humor.much to say. my hope is that the books will tell the story till the end. this show did not. i saw that."
2013-04-16,tbmforclasstsar,Walk of Punishment,8,"with the introductory episodes out of the way, and nearly all major narratives firmly established, this week we were treated to an especially raucous, brutally violent, and at times laugh,out-loud funny installment of a show that is already known for its violence and dark humor.""walk of punishment,"" which could easily describe most of the events of books three and four in one succinct phrase, kicked things into high gear with our first big jaw-dropping moment, as well as not one, but two near rapes. it's overall a sprawling, but enjoyable episode which keeps the momentum going that was built in the previous two entries for the most part, aside from a few scenes in king's landing that dragged mostly due to lack of real conflict at the moment.so looks like i was wrong last week in saying we had met all the characters, when there was still edmure and the blackfish to be seen. how could i forget blackfish after his two-season absence? and what better way to introduce such a beloved character from the books. pushing aside edmure after he fails to light the floating funeral pyre three times, brynden ""blackfish"" tully makes short work of the matter when he fires a flaming arrow directly into the boat as it drifts into the distance, without even a glance back to see if it hits; the medieval version of walking away from an explosion. obviously, this is a man you want on your side. as we see in the meeting between robb and blackfish, he is a much more respected figure than edmure, robb's uncle, despite his status as the black sheep of the fish-sigiled family (thus the nickname, in case it wasn't clear). later, catelyn and blackfish discuss the recently deceased hoster tully, whom she cries over. it's harder to connect emotionally to the death of someone we've never seen on screen or interact with cat before, but when it becomes obvious that she's grieving more for the situation that she's put her own children into by leaving them the way her father left her, it's a much more gripping and heartbreaking scene.meanwhile, back in king's landing, the small council has gathered to discuss affairs of state, beginning with a humorous chair shuffling scene, depicting more of tyrion's satirical wit to the exasperation of the no-nonsense tywin. and with the shuffling of the chairs so comes the shuffling of titles; littlefinger is off to woo the widowed lysa arryn (catelyn's not-quite-all-there sister) leaving tyrion to take charge of the royal coffers. a bit of a demotion from hand of the king, but at least he still has power, and after the emotionally crippling talk with his father in the first episode, it's a sugar-coated bitter pill. tyrion also gives us the funniest scene so far this season when he decides to reward his faithful squire, pod, for saving his life in the battle of blackwater bay. being that it's tyrion, naturally pod is rewarded with three working girls, which fills game of thrones' weekly nudity quota. however, when pod returns from the brothel and lays the gold to pay the girls on his desk, tyrion and bronn are hilariously in stunned awe, and demand to know the details of pod's first real and, by all imagination, miraculous conquest.in a bit of fun for readers of the books, we're treated to a boisterous rendition of 'the bear and the maiden fair' by jaime and brienne's captors, while the odd couple are literally bound to each other. in yet another smart move by the show runners, the list of important names has been shaved in an attempt to be kind to viewer's brains, but readers may be a little miffed at the absence of vargo hoat and his bloody mummers, when their appearance is so memorable. at least now that they're in the same dangerous boat, jaime seems to be opening up to the female knight in a small way, when he gives her genuine advice on what to do when the captors rape her. uh baby steps? to read the rest (imdb form too short) visit: custodianfilmcritic.com/game-of-thrones-3-3-walk-of-punishment/"
2019-05-20,intrepidami,New found respect for Martin.,8,"what can i say. it's like journey without steve perry. ohh sure they can sort of duplicate the voice, but the good song writing went right out the window. ohh sure if you look at older journey albums practically ever song has co,writing credits, one guy leaves and suddenly...no hits! the guy himself goes on to write a few, but his former band suddenly can't buy one! the results speak for themselves.same thing here, whomever took these rich characters and storylines by martin just isn't up to the task of completing the series well. it was a whole bunch of smashed together vignettes of the starks going off to their various fates.some people might like the way snow killed daenerys. i thought it was ridiculous. she suddenly dropped all her guard and acted like snow was just going to be prince charming to her snow white. she should have been guarded and snow should have had to convince her it was going to be alright and then killed her. instead she was all smiles. totally out of character.when sansa declared she would rule her own kingdom the others just accepted that? bwahahahaha. especially greyjoy, like she would play nice. ""well we like daenerys, but if you all want this, ok"" does that seem anything like her?it could have ended after the first fade to black, but returned time and again for at least 15 minutes.after everything you've seen up till now, does anybody think the unsullied and the dalthraci would not put up with jon snow and lannister surviving? that they would just accept the will of the people? they literally hate all the people!i don't know exactly what happened. my guess? martin is not suffering from severe writers block. he tried to hold out for a big payday and hbo went on without him. we're being fed a pr story and this was the end result."

2020-05-19,alshamari-marwa,Extraordinary untill season 8,10,"this is the first series i would recommend to anybody , it is an amazing piece of work , the most stunning tv series you will ever watch. why i gave it 9/10 because of the last season, it's still good but very disappointing compared to all the seasons. you will enjoy every episode"
2019-05-24,larosaj-26666,S8 was near perfect,10,all whiny nerds aside who know nothing except to whine of course. amazing spectacular show that improved with every season after s1 which was perfect. only drawbacks in s8 were the darkness of the winterfell battle and no final confrontation between snow and greyworm. anyone paying attention and not lacking common sense could see where it was going with dany since way back. i hoped otherwise but it happened.......all these losers crying because the show didn't go their way are just pathetic. it didn't go my way but i respect the way they ended it. the final 5 minutes with the editing and music is one of the most breathtaking and beautiful finales i've ever seen.
2019-09-28,larosaj-26666,S8 was spectacular,9,"just went to a concert and got the cd for s8. will have to watch this magnificent season again and not the one the whiny pathetic viewers petitioned for since there was nothing wrong with it. all characters acted as they should especially jaime who still stayed the noble person he became and probably always was when separated from his family but couldn't break from his live for cersei. i suspect many viewers haven't experienced true love and have no concept what affect it has on you and daenerys madness was easy to see if you know, you can actually think and deduce things. i will forever champion this season. great that they won for this superb season. the whiny haters must be eating crow now."
2018-04-23,samyaksambuddha,"A blend of fantasy, entertainment and drama",8,"at the beginning of this fantasy series i saw it as erotic and only meant for entertainment. as i proceeded i learnt depth of the philosophy hidden. this series is an expression of the weird yet true games played around the quest for power. at the same time it shows new elements like white walkers, faceless men that not heard. this is not only a fantasy but a philosophical work. loved watching it and desperately waiting for the season,8."
2020-04-03,goswamidiptanshu,The most epic/greatest thing ever!,10,literally nothing can match the level of intensity like the show every season has literally one or two groundbreaking episodes each and every scene tells more with the picture and talking the fights the story the buildup the music the screenplay the acting the visuals each and everything was epic and never seen before wonder!from night king to iron throne to starks and lannisters every thing was beautifully written!no wonder greatest quotes are present in here too!politics and war was like i am playing that in real life such impact full it is!although ending 3 episodes did'nt quite felt satisfying but it was digestable!not a perfect ending yet the greatest show of all time!

2011-06-01,axismladen,"Some characters are not well casted, but the book(s) is/are adapted quite faithfully. An amazing TV series. Watch under any cost!",9,"i was very excited but still quite skeptical when i found out that they're gonna adapt one of my favorite books. book series that is, but game of thrones is my favorite in the series so far. i'm an amateur screenwriter and one day i came to an idea of trying to adapt something since i've already written a couple of original screenplays. i wanted a high task and i wanted it to be a fantasy so i looked for the best fantasy on the internet and everyone said that this is it. and they were right. i read lord of the rings, which is/are amazing, but this is something special and very different from anything i've ever read. all the characters are so well done, the storyline is so interesting with a whole bunch of unexpected twists, and so on... you don't even have a feeling that it's a fantasy while you're reading it. anyway, it didn't take me long to read the book and understand that it can't be adapted. into a movie, that is. so i gave up on adaptation, but i continued with reading the series and all i can say is i can't wait for the fifth book! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> as for the tv series, the book is more or less quite faithfully adapted. of course, some parts are missing, some unimportant characters thrown out, most of the characters, especially young ones, a lot older than in the books and certain parts a bit changed, though they all still have the same ending, but that was to be expected. the book(s) is/are obviously a lot better, but the tv adaptation is still great. brilliant. amazing. not as amazing as the book(s) but still....>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> certain actors, i must say, really don't fit their roles. such as jon snow, joffrey lannister, theon greyjoy, catelyn stark and even cersei i'd say, but what can you do. it shouldn't mind to those who didn't read the books. characters that are well casted are, i think, eddard stark, tyrion lannister, arya stark, brann stark, daenerys targaryen, khal drogo, tywin lannister, gregor clegane,... there is much more of those who are not good for their roles but most of them are supporting characters so i wont mention them a lot, but the point is that casting should've been done a lot better. joffrey, for instance, is supposed to be a very pretty kid with full lips an the actor looks like dennis the menace with thin lips and the most evil eyes i've ever seen. really not good for his part even though his character is evil. jon snow is supposed to look way younger than the actor who plays him is, just like sansa stark and so on. but i guess i can go over those things since the series are really great and i'm just happy that the book(s) are being adapted in the first place.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> watch this series. they are great. like the godfather set in a fantasy medieval world. the sopranos with swords and even better. my recommendation to everyone. and i just wanna say that i'm glad they didn't cut the nudity and brutality out of the series. that would really ruin everything since the books are pretty unmerciful toward it's characters and the story in general. 10 out of 10!!!!"
2018-04-16,cmc2392,Great Fantasy Show Drama!!!!,9,"i love ancient world history about dragons, dwarves and warlocks. interesting based on royal england thrones. problem is the trump era and the starks family clan. people had been dying but lannisters are luckily alive. starks are strong and loving family too, but robb strongest which is unfair to kill off. it is weak and useless that starks https://corleonesandlannisters.com/tag/klaus,mikaelson/. the great thing people do generate characters in the george r. r.martin. to be fair suggested, highlander show and the originals inspired characters to regain their life in modern day. one most disappointing part is the starks does not keep themselves together back in the day of the thirteenth century. unlike the originals' mikaelsen and shameless' s gallgaher, the starks left their family and get killed by territories. all of the situations is because of sansa and bran's fault. this is what starks should learn from the originals mikaesen witch hope and liam gallagher who are quite a conscious know what family means for them and show sacrifice. mostly, shocked ""the red wedding scene where robb and his wife get killed. omg, actor play robb stark should play connor macleod he super well qualified brish accent for scottish highlander including jon snow actor kit harrington. therefore, starks have inherited anglo saxon mostly scottish clans and norman tribe; william the conqueror.   game of throne based war of rose. there is another show inspired like got on real-life vent in european history; soap opera drama empire cast mostly many african -american inspired the lion in winter. marvel x-men based and resemblance the got characters. to bne fair, the show is on hbo company including many other shows; sopranoes, six feet under, and true blood."
2016-11-26,rawiri42,How long is history?,9,"after several years (during which game of thrones was only available on pay,tv) and lots and lots of hype, i was visiting my local hi-fi retailer and saw a stand with game of thrones being offered at three seasons for the price of two so i figured, ""i've heard all the wonderful comments. it's time i saw this thing!"" and bought seasons 1 to 3. wow! this is how a story should be told! in real life, we have bill clinton and monica and donald trump and all his women and people throw their arms up in horror at their antics (and then go off to their local strip club or brothel and do the same stuff). everyone knows that it goes on and has gone on since david seduced bathsheba (and before that even) but no one has ever told it like it is - until now!nothing is hidden in game. we see it all just as it was and i, for one, welcome that. some might say that nothing is left to the imagination but i don't want to have to work my imagination when i'm relaxing and being entertained. if i wanted to work my imagination, i'd submit a couple of episodes! i'm not sure how many seasons game of thrones is intended to go on for but history never ends so why not just keep writing it (like coronation street)? as long as the viewers want to watch it, it will keep selling and, in the end, that's what movie-making is all about. the beheadings and battles, the sex scenes and duplicity are all laid out in lurid detail and i love it! one question though: what's with all the futuristic mechanical gadgetry during the opening sequence? it seems to place the whole story into a totally different time frame and i must say that i find that really offputting (to the point where i fast-forward through it)."
2021-03-31,jfh-72320,"Good, not great.",8,"didn't watch this when it was originally broadcast. watched it as a 'pandemic series'.it's a good story, but not the best thing since sliced bread, that it's made out to be. written well, but 99% of the characters are scumbags that you aren't rooting for. hard to like most any of them.the clear intention was to put as much sex and nudity into the show as possible. none of which adds any value to the story.i've seen better shows, that i anticipated each episode more than this one. but if you want to fill 80 hours, you can do worse than this.obviously, this will appeal to dungeons and dragons or world of warcraft nerds in their dark basements at home."
2019-08-12,gamerz-18042,"A fantastic series, culminating in a rushed ending!",8,"i came in late to the got craze, but you will be hooked after just one episode.although it got slightly boring towards season 5, it picked up again. it is an epic journey, we feel and learn about each of the numerous characters. some episodes are ground breaking in shock value.fantastic actors which culminates fluctuate and vary throughout the seasons.the last season is what the viewers have been waiting for, sadly for all it's good, the episodes where rushed as we see characters quickly tied of any loose plot lines, and in true got fashion unexpected twist of events that end in rather bitter and perplexing finish to the series."
2019-08-28,valentin_sieben,season8,10,"its rushed just about right. grrmartin did something i found only in those big books of thinkers. i understand why bran is king. you should read hegel, heidegger, husserl. john snow is the only tragic hero. kit harrington acted perfect. almost there s nothing perfect in the world of beeing. im curios about the books to come. fire is still the enemy and daenerys gone means its free. game of thrones is the best tv show since ghilgamesh s adventures were not filmed."

even after the lousy ending, i still love game of thrones though. so much."

2020-06-21,simond1900,After watching the series from beginning to end. And letting it sink in.,9,"firstly i'll say, game of thrones is the best fantasy you can watch on the screen. i even think it beats lord of the rings, though just marginally, but yeah, i think got takes the throne.but, as many expressed before, the last two seasons aren't as good as the earlier seasons and mostly some people are disappointed about the ending. which is understandable. i kind of felt the same way. watching season eigth in one sitting, i enjoyed myself but were dissapointed at the same time. a weird mix of emotions to have.i thought it was alright though, they just wrapped it all up in a neat little package and focused on big epic and dramatic battle sequences, and that every character got some sort of closure to their storyline. i think people don't like it more beacuse of the fact that the journey is more fun then the final destination, many times. and it's a bit underwhelming, because the show spent so many hours building up to its final and it all just explodes in on itself and ends so quickly and abroubtly.i personally had hoped for that it would end with deanerys sitting on the iron throne. or perhaps that cersei would outsmart everyone and keep the throne in the end. and pretty much all other characters would die. or that the night king would win, would have been awesome also. he should at least have gotten further then winterfell. he was never that big of a threat really. but i could actually have gone so many ways, even arya could have taken the throne, if not sansa or even tyron, or jon off course.but i did like the ending with the throne being melted as well, it has some symbolism to it. and all the battle sequences during the entire eight season were epic, i enjoyed them for the scenery. a bit much perhaps though, but i think they blended the action with the story well, so you got both. it was just as good and well made as a blockbuster movie.the problems i have mostly with the last two seasons are that the army of the dead, the white walkers and the night king, does not ever really come of as a real threat. you only need a couple of feet of water and they can do nothing. they have no combat skill, they're just relentless, but you can kind of cut them to pieces like nothing, sure their body parts move around but why bother? what are they gonna do? and as long as you have valerian steal or dragon glas, you can kill the white walkers with no problem, even the night king is an easy kill.and how long were they in the frozen lake in season seven? gendry must have run as a gazelle and that raven must have been flying with lightning speed and deanerys sure did find them awfully quick, i mean how big is westeros? maybe it's smaller then i first imagined, dragonstone is far from the wall on the map, still it seemed all that just took a couple of hours. sure, the writers setting it up so the night king could get the ice dragon. but they could have done that better i think.and how slow is this army of the dead? they sure had a lot of time prepering in winterfell before they show up, i mean winterfell is relatively close to the wall. some of the night watch and wildlingd that ran from the wall when it fell, got to winterfell way faster. did the army of the dead took a coffee break on the way or something?and jon snow stabbing deanerys. come on. such a cheap move. he stood by her so far. then all of a sudden he's going to sneakingly murder her? wasn't loyalty and honesty his thing? ned stark would be ashamed. way too drastic. yes, she overreacted destroying the entire city, but done is done. let her be queen. cersei begged for it anyway, it's more her fault. they all tried really hard to be diplomatic with her, she refused. cersei brought the destruction to the city. she should have know better messing with a tagaryan, they're flippin crazy.how does jon fly and control the dragon? i assumed deanerys had some sort of telaphy with the dragons, but does he have that as well, or how does that work? there are some other minor things like this that kind of bugged me. it also seemed to be more and more of those things like that, as further the show went. it doesn't completely break the show, it's just that it's forcing you to suspend your disbelief more and more, and it's already a fantasy with dragons, magic and zombies, so you're already doing that enough. they should have tried harder to keep it together.also, the very last scene, are they're really sitting there discussing mondane things like nothing happened, all happy like, back to normal? didn't the city and the castle got half destroyed? wouldn't that take some time to repair? what about the emotional and psychological damage to the citizens with so many dead? but everything's back to normal, happy days. then, bran stark became king of the seven kingdomes? really? why did everybody listen to tyron? i think it would be totally chaos in westeros after all that happened and no way to fix it. everybody would try to take the power now, beacuse it would suddenly be completely up for grabs, with all the most powerful families and houses already completely destroyed. it would be more war. but they had to have a happy ending, but it's a real happy ending, beacuse it's not realistic.and honestly, might sound terrible, but i actually would have liked it more if some more characters died. like, it's the end anyway. bring it on. they saved way too many. like the night king should have been unstoppable and killed the whole lot of them, so you really would freak out wondering who's gonna go and who's gonna gonna survive, thinking anythings possible, perhaps the night king even wins? then you really would feel the true threat of what they had been building up for seven seasons.all that said. season eight was alright. could have been better. but it was alright. they had to wrap it up. they made some decisions. the wrote a decent script. the production and actors did the rest. it was fine. i enjoy the entire show as a whole. first 4 seasons are a above the rest, but it's all good. i'm actually not complaining. it was fine. and there's still the books to be finished, which probably will have a completely other conclusion to it all, which also actually will be canon. he's getting a bit old though... let's hope for the best."
2019-05-17,criticalofeverything,A once terrific show bogged down due to horrible writing.,1,"game of thrones used to be one of my favourite shows on television. it was the perfect fantasy story with complex and detailed stories with characters that you actually cared about, along with simply fantastic writing and good acting with a great sense of tension. however, ever since season 4 ended, the show has taken a rather significant hit in quality, and it soon went from being fantastic to good and then good to straight up idiotic. while season 5 and 6 weren't the worst, and season 7 didn't really have my blood boiling, there was a definitely recognisable change in the writing and plots. it stopped being as sophisticated and became straight up average. all that was saving it was the other good things about the show like the visuals, characters, tension and drama. but now we're here, at the final season:game of thrones season 8 is one of the worst seasons of any tv show i have ever watched in my entire life. it throws everything you ever cared about with this show out the window for cheap expectation subversions, it completely shatters and throws aside character arcs that you have wanted resolved, it completely destroys many of the characters you once loved, the writing has gotten to a whole new level of atrocious with d&d giving excuses like ""oh they just forgot about them"" to justify it, it is filled with plot holes and contrivances, ex,machinas, and so many impressively dumb moments and deaths that make the last jedi look like citizen kane. this is the last jedi of got, it ruins everything you have ever loved about it, it disregards the fact that you have loved this show for nearly a decade just so it can get away with wrapping up the story in a way that even the actors of the damn show hate.i have never seen a tv show get affected by seasonal rot this hard. a once truly terrific show bogged down due to horrible writing, and they're not even going to up their game for the ending. years of watching this show that i'll never be able to get back. thanks d&d, or should we start calling you dumb and dumber? try not to ruin star wars next."
2020-03-20,lily_hoho,My love,7,"after watching the sopranos, i thought this was the end of american tv. i didn't expect to have mad men. when mad men end, i thought there was no show to be a backup.this will be the work of god forever."
2021-05-13,motrous,Game of Thrones,9,"this is a tough one to rate given the controversial last two seasons. overall the series is great. it was some of the most engaging television i've watched. i loved the characters and the twisting plot. sure, the last couple seasons could have been better, but we got what we got. in the end it wasn't perfect, but it was a cultural phenomenon the likes of which we probably won't see again for a while."
2019-05-24,nafodude,Still a great,8,"i was one of those people that didnt even want to watch the programme. i stumbled into got after season 6 had finished purely out of boredom. once i'd started, i couldn't stop, binge watching until i was eventually dreaming got.after i'd caught up and completed season 6, i started bothering the wife to watch, she eventually succumbed to my relentless bombardment.
i watched the entire programme again with the wife soon enough, feeling exactly the same way that i do.
got is by far the best programme i've ever seen, the characters embedded themselves so deep into my consciousness that i felt i knew them.all of the time and emotions spent watching this programme, only to have the final season sweep my respect away.
i emplore you to watch got, it peaks at the end of season 6 and then slowly declines in my opinion, although season 7 was still pretty good.
the rest is history and unfortunately one i'm not going to forget for all the wrong reasons............."
2019-11-02,max6640,Awesome show and very well done,10,"the show was almost perfect in many ways. acting and script and how the show killed off people.however, my main problem was emilia clarke not the right person to play her role. she is wooden and cheap and just plain appalling at that character. especially in the latter seasons she didn't have the presence on screen to be taken seriously. anyone could of challenged her and just killed her off.dumb casting for that role."
2020-10-08,max6640,Good show spoilt by a rediculous notion that the drsgon,7,"that the dragon mother would have anyone listen to her. she was weak, and tried to act like a man but failed. any man around her would do cut her head off in a second and no one would of stopped them. she would not of commanded anything. that character was the worst i have seen in any show because it just wasn't believable. maybe the part was written wrong or the wrong actress chosen because that emilia clarke is a terrible actress and ruined the show. lena headey was superb. but the useless little girl would command nothing and no one would have respect for her. the part was written wrong for the show. and they chose the wrong actress.before all you can boys and girls jump up and down.... you are blinded by your own silly little lives and ""know nothing"" as the other girl would say. i didn't watch this show till this week as i'm not a fan of anything hollywood , bit this was not bad accept for the part i have expressed"
2020-11-29,levybob,PERFECTION. Or close to.,7,"ok. i admit that i recently binge,watched all 8 seasons; one episode a night for nearly 80 nights. i did that because when the series first played and i watched one episode a week, i could not keep track of the names, the games, the goals, the kings, and the fools. so i stopped. until now, the pandemic providing me with nothing but time; time enough to watch and wonder-at this marvelous series.i will not go into the plot or the individual performances. for one thing all the performances are a+. the plot is either well-known-enough or so complex that my disclosing it might turn potential viewers off.but ask me what the 'themes' are that hold the story (ies) together, i would say this: the friends of your enemy are your enemy as well. your enemy's enemy is a good bet to turn out to be your friend. keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. and finally, the definition of 'enemy' and / or 'friend' can and does change as often as the weather.watch this series.really. i hope you do."
2019-05-29,paulchristechgod,This show was good.......,6,but after that disappointing finale i give it a flat out 1/10
2019-09-21,mochteam,Excellent story telling for the first 6 -7 seasons,4,"one of the best shows i've watched in a long time. seasons 1 through 6 were probably some of the best most memorable moments on t.v. lots of twists and unexpected turns. season 7 things seemed to become a bit shallow and didn't seem as intricately told as with the earlier season. when season 8 came around the show pretty much just wanted it to be over with or so that's how it felt watching as a viewer. the story telling ended and became very simplistic. characters did things that were completely out of character for their roles they built up in the previous 6,7 seasons. it all left me with a very dissatisfying feeling at the end. to say the least the shows story just fell out of plot and you were left with whatever the producers felt would be sufficient to end the series.i've learned much from watching this series for years and that is not to get too hung up on a series and to also not invest so much of my time and interests into them because if they don't end after 3-4 seasons they usually just go sour. the only other series i can say that was good all the way through was the x-files and the wire. sure they had some bad seasons but they picked them up and ended on a highnote that was satisfying but i've learned that's rare. so take it as you will game of thrones is great for it's earlier seasons and notorious for its terrible ending season. will it be one of the best series in history? very doubtful as it already seems to be forgotten but it will be the most memorable as having the worst final season."
2017-08-21,dishlady69,The Winter Is Coming. Thank Goodness.,2,"i have to say that from seasons 1,4 -- which is as far as i've been able to watch because i have a life -- the series is so bad that you almost can't stop watching... because how much worse can it actually get?the whole series is like a clip of xanadu placed in dante's inferno. without giving anything away, the sheer number of characters creates enough chaos to turn the viewer off. you start to think, ""surely at some point things will level off,"" but the number of spoiled and whining rich kids is just overwhelming. a few of them die off (thank goodness), but it's just not enough to make the series appealing. there are too many diversions from the books -- yes, read the books and don't go by this ridiculous adaptation.i've never rated anything a 1 out of 10 in my life. i really thing that there's a silver lining in everything, but this... i don't know, guys. it's time to cut your losses. of course the show is insanely popular in the states... but look who they put on their ""throne."" ugh."
2021-02-04,master_strange,Game of Thrones is a Must Watch Show,8,"this show is a fantastic show, from its memorable quotes, to its iconic characters, to epic battles, game of thrones is a must watch show. got is also filled with plot twists that come unexpectedly towards everybody, it has deaths that will break your heart, and deaths that will make you smile. got with this incredible actors, cliffhangers, and quotes such as ""you know nothing, jon snow."" so if you haven't seen it yet, turn on the tv and watch it now."
2020-12-08,shaunmcevoy-98833,Season 8's the reason this isn't a Perfect 10/10,10,"the first 6 seasons where absolutely incredible, some of the best tv i've ever seen. i was invested for years it just kept getting better, so many unforgettable moments. they ran out of content and just didn't know what to do, there not grrm not even close. since the pilot it we knew the main threat was the white walkers, it all built up to the battle to end all battles, 8 years we waited for that they've finally breached the wall and then reached winterell and it all just fell so flat... ayra stabs the night king then that's it. it was just such a terrible decision, the worst ending to that arc imaginable. i would of preferred the army of the dead to kill everyone at winterfell then march to kings landing and kill 99% of everyone there in a huge gigantic battle and let a few people escape on ships to essos. the very last scene of got should've been cersei looking back at the night king truly and utterly terrified after witnessing a massacre and the realisation that ""all those stories"" she dismissed as nonsense are in fact true. the night king stares directly at cersie as he did with jon at hardhome. he then proceeds to raise thousands of the dead as cersie sails away to essos and then cut to black. that would of been truly terrifying and unsettling. got was never been a show that give you a happy ending. it slaughtered characters you really cared about like ned and robb stark. the execution of ned and the red wedding are such shocking moments. having everyone at the end be fine and brann as king was so stupid i hated it so much he turned into a terrible character who literally contributed nothing but ends up on top. then jaime goes back and dies in rubble with cersie ruining one of my favourite characters. cleganebowl happens just for fan service and the hound dies i would've personally kept him alive past end scene. and don't get me started on dani just randomly turning psycho out the blue for no reason killing everyone. all she had to was go the red keep and burn it down with cersie in it. then drogon burns the iron throne for no reason. 90% of got fans could've written better ending that this drivel. never the less still a really amazing show for the most part and one i will never forget. looking forward to the prequels too. definitely check got out it's outstanding up until season 8"
2020-01-07,arod_85,Overrated,10,"i have to give this show points for its realistic perspective of the time period regardless of the violence. medieval days were violent. let's face it, incestreous relationships have been the norm in royal families amongst many cultures across early history. the treatment of woman is also likely an accurate representation of the times. the show also gets points for its beauty. the sets look good, the cgi whitewalkers and dragons also look very good for a tv show. my problem is i find it to be a little boring. when something happens, it has its ""wow factor"" but it takes so long to get there.i also had an issue with nearly all characters being killed off every other week. it's so difficult to root for a character or see the story through when you know they are going to end up killed off. i'm all for suspense and doing this on occasion for a shock factor, but when 95% of the characters you spent watching and investing in end up dead, it becomes monotonous and i was often left feeling ""why bother"". many aspects of the show can be interesting, but i do not find it worthy of its current 9 star rating..."
2019-05-20,hotrobinproductions,Used to be 10/10 season 8 is why it's only a 9,9,"a shows ending, is just as significant and more important than everything. some shows do it perfectly, some have us divided, and others do it terribly. this show, ends terribly. other than that, i enjoyed my time with this show and i can't deny the godlike seaon 1,7 was amazing, i'm aware most people didn't like some other seasons but i'm not picky, i think they did great 1-7, season 8 is a huge catastrophe and a story's ending is the post important thing. other than that my time spent other than season 8 was definitely worth the time i have had with any show. breaks my heart to see the show ended rushed and overall badly."
2021-03-25,jared-25331,One of the greatest TV Shows of all time!,10,"i just got done watching the show and i have to say is that this is one of my favorite tv shows that i've seen. the production design, the writing, the storylines, the characters, & the acting are phenomenal.season 4 is my favorite season of this show. tyrion lannister palyed by peter dinklage is my favorite character on the show. the final season is the weakest season of the entire show, i don't hate it, but you can tell that it was rushed & the final episode was dissappointing.overall, game of thrones is a fantastic show & i highly recommend that you watch this show."
2012-12-04,loue15,"Fantastically alive adaptation - rich, violent and good",8,"gloriously big, classy, brave, sexy and violent production of george rr martin's extraordinary ""game of thrones"" saga. the show benefits incalculably from the now,familiar hbo approach (lots of tits, lots of gore, great acting by heavyweights - lots of brits, yay! - amazing scenery and set design, costumes, the lot), and it creates more vivid tableaux-vivants from martin's wonderful source material than anyone, it seems, thought possible. right down to the beautifully intricate steam punk opening credits, this is a whole show, thought through consistently and presumably costing an absolute fortune to make. the writer whose books have sold in the tens of millions deserves no less, but it was still surprising to see scenes take place on screen that matched so completely those that had occurred in my imagination when reading the books.the script is snappy and clever; characters scheme and fight, and face bigger, scarier threats than knights' swords. almost every actor with a speaking part performs excellently. there were just one or two that seemed a trifle weak to me; for example, lena headey, beautiful in her huge blond tresses, corrupt as sin, but strangely lacking in commitment to her lines. i was initially disappointed by emilia clarke as dany, and her story among the dothraki - and by her khal, clearly chosen for his man-mountain status and stripped of dialogue - may as well have been chewbacca. but i warmed to dany as the series went on, and her final appearances in series 2 were truly powerful. good on her. ""the imp"" gets all the best lines, as indeed peter dinklage deserves - a great, once-in-a-lifetime part.speaking as an anti-lord-of-the-rings person, i would say that the whole thing is great, great stuff. please, go out and enjoy."

2019-09-22,ricochet93-369-308802,Season 7 and 8 Saved the Show!!!!,5,"game of thrones was in fear of becoming pedestrian until the battle of the bastards.we had endured several long seasons of the show going nowhere, in fact 30mins of each show was usually daenerys saying her name ""daenerys, mother of dragons, storm born...blah blah"". her story arc was boring and dragged out.the real joy was the action and pacing of season 7 & 8, which got the lagging show moving again.and that ending, to kill off the most boring character, daenerys, fantastic. it broke millions of hearts of romantics all around the world who wanted a disney ending!it ended perfectly and redeemed itself, just as it had started, savage and unforgiving.i love the fact that the ""happy ending we want season 8 remade brigade"" are still crying online about it. may your tears over runith."
2016-12-22,bellab1972,Great show! Great great show!,1,"game of thrones, what can you say! i imagine everyone has seen it by now and either love it or hate it! i did both, i hated the first episode i saw but gave it a chance and now love it! i have many questions about game of thrones like why was john snow initially only suppose to be 16 years old when he looks 25? i would have liked different actors playing main roles like amelia clarke who really can't act but seems to be popular due to the dragons! can't viewers recognize bad acting these days! the last few seasons have been a tad insulting to the viewers considering we only get short seasons! the first few seasons were sensational with constant story progression and episodes full of drama highlighting most of the families in the show. i can't believe viewers like episodes that seem to be lazy and cheap to produce and focus on one thing with no story progression whatsoever. they throw in a dragon scene and everyone goes nuts and thinks the show is great except for those who have a brain! i hope the next season goes back to the original formula of the intricate story line and constant story progression!"
2018-08-28,kirollos-noah,The most fascinating series!,8,"well, i'm sure that if i started watching that series with its season one premiere in 2011, i wasn't going to keep watching it! it was so boring as a big series, but fortunately, i was underage, so last year ,after i got registered- i bought it. but i got bored, because of season one, then i stopped watching it, and then i watched it again and i loved it! glad that i didn't miss the 'game'!sorry for the long intro. let's get now to season one of game of thrones...i'm a big fan of george r.r. martin's books, a song of ice and fire! and hbo made a great tv adaption, with the details, performances, scenery, cast, costumes and every-single-thing! hbo's got made me love it, more than the books it-selves! but it didn't do that fast, it took 6 episodes to be a routine of mine. after 6 episodes, got became something i must do everyday, literately!the slow storytelling in this season, bothered me to hell! 6 episodes with nothing, and then some interesting things in episode 7,,same in episode 8, and then the two saviors of the season, episode 9 and the season finale!that's my only and biggest problem with this season.. so after the salvation of this season, i'm gonna give it an 8/10.now with the -not very- step forward season, season two... as i said, it's not a very step forward, but it's defiantly better than the first one!it had a slow storytelling, but not like the first season, and the saviors this time, saved it very well!the cgi of episode 9 was brilliant... btw, this episode was the best in this season.so the performance is definitely better than the first one, and the story got richer, actually!so got season two is better and more effective than season one! i'm gonna give it a 9/10.and now season three... it has the same problems with season two, the only difference is the improved cgi, that's all!so until now, got has the same problem, but it's getting improved, for that i'm gonna give got season three 9/10, just like the second season for me.a huge step forward for got! season four is totally -with no dout- amazing and perfectly made!loved every single episode of it! everything was just perfect, even the soundtrack was very awesome! they really got attention for every detail. they didn't make any mistake, literately! i didn't feel any boredom in this season, not even once! the cgi was more even better than the three previous seasons! and episode 9 was totally freaking out!! the direction, soundtrack,performances and the cgi, made it the best episode in this entire series!season 4 is definitely great, with memorable moments and great soundtrack and cgi! got season 4 deserves a 10/10!after having a great time with season 4, back again to the same problem with the first 3 seasons.. boredom! and i thought that i will never feel it again, after season 4. but here we are again, poor stuff happening, until episode 7!it actually went worse than the first one in those 7 episode, but once again they needed a savior, but this time their saviors were totally powerful, especially episode 8!because of their three saviors, i liked this season, but stills, a big step back! so, season five will get an 8/10.they got awake, and hit us with the second best season of the series, season 6.this season is very epic and entertaining indeed, but it's not like season 4, because season 4 had everything under-control, but season missed the soundtrack, but stills a fascinating season though! and again -finally- they didn't need a savior! every-episode was fighting to be the best in the season, and episode 9 won, but stills not special like s4 e9.so got is back again with a big hit season! season 6 absolutely deserves a 10/10!and now, the latest season, season 7. this season was definitely epic, gore and amazing!
the problem here ain't boredom, it's some missing elements!the sexual content is totally lost, the violence is down and the battle in episode 6 wasn't so epic, but it was good though!
but it has a very stupid thing, how the white walkers brought the dragon?!so because of the missing elements, season 7 went down!
got season 7 gets a 9/10.so game of thrones is my favorite series of all the time, so far! and i can't wait for the series finale!
game of thrones gets a 9/10."

2019-05-22,wikkid_gamez,Wtf happened??? When the final season ruins the series...,10,"seriously? they made everyone wait 2 years for that? ... mistakes everywhere.... plot holes, stuff (starbucks cup ep 4 and water bottles ep 8) left on sets that made it into the finished product? ... is it possible to scream out ""we don't care about this bs anymore"" more than that? that's exactly what they are saying... i can't even fit all the plot holes in this review so i will only point out my biggest issues with this season ... like how can jon be sentenced to the wall that isn't even needed anymore as the white walkers are gone and that was its original use and what about the fact that the north is finally its own country so they have no jurisdiction there and the wall is part of the north? or the fact that considering that he was actually first in line to be king as a direct descendent of the prince who was to be the king that they would even be able to arrest him? (visarys was in line after jon and dany would have been after visarys) or the fact that technically he was still the king in the north and never abdicated his throne. bending the knee is not abdicating. how did the dothraki go from being completely wiped out in ep 3 to being around magically again after? i saw dany's decent into madness coming unfortunately, from the time she burned all the khals and crucified the slave traders, or when she had xaro and doreah locked inside the merchant prince's vault left to die. to the time she killed sam's father and brother just because they refused to ""bend the knee"".... all actions of a conquerer or a dictator not a liberator. going to those extremes just to prove her point and teach a lesson. however they rushed her final decent into full madness waaaaay too fast in season 8 to the point that its like whiplash. her obsession with the iron throne evident throughout the series but everything came about so gradually that it was easy to overlook. they really should have made this last season a full season and done things right. or if this was what they they were going to turn out as the finished sloppy copy of the rushed series finale then they should have just added it on to last season. making everyone wait for 2 years then not even being able to edit properly for coffee cups and water bottles is beyond disappointing. they may as well have just had the night king win and everyone die... cersei getting to die romantically in jaime's arms as the world crumbled around them? i mean seriously? after everything she did? she deserved to die in a slow agonizing way. nothing would have been too much. this seriously could have been the greatest show created to date (aside from soa lol) but this last season not only damaged the overall rating of the show but also makes half of the things you learn as plots are unveiled completely pointless and useless. i would have rated this show a 10/10 before this season. the only reason it is still even 7/10 is because the previous seasons were so well done. i will just have to wait for the books to be finished as i know they will be done right."
2019-05-20,m0viel0ver,"It's a TV show. It's a TV show based on a book. ""Mistakes were made.""",10,"the books are the books. i think some people didn't realize some of this tv show as based on the book series. even so, what do you expect from tv script,writing once there is not a book to reference?the books are more gruesome, so for those complaining about the show, why watch it if you couldn't handle the sins and filth?for those book lovers, tv never turns out a good representation, so why would they start now?for those that loved the character development, fx, scenes, and story line -- well, you got cheated in the end (and if you read the books, you really got cheated, but that's life). it's a tv show and once they had no book to follow, you see what happened. it fell off the cliff.7 for the episodes leading up to the cliff.i'm sure we'll see this story rise again in some form. $$$"
2021-06-04,kreamleehan,Brave self-harming,10,"up until season 4? 5? til the battle of the ***, it was going great! greeeeat! but right after that part, they start neglecting their own story. twisting plots, changing characters, wasting possible turn outs and ignoring previous events! it's like they're purposefully trying to ruin their own show! why spend all these years? why spent all those money and effort just to undermine your work?! huh?!?!?! i don't get it. and to think they mostly did that with this one character. yeesh! like that character wasn't out of the place enough."
2020-07-02,ropelawshiel,Will never watch again,7,"some reviewers have said"" a few bad episodes dont ruin a whole show"" ,for me they do. i dont see any reason to re watch character's and there development over 6/7 years, so the whole thing can be flushed down the toilet, with the last 3 episode's. why would i re watch, knowing the bad outcome why root for them?. i thought this was a great series, but no more.
sadly, dexter did the same."
2016-12-28,ericjg623,"Get your barf bags, folks!",10,"this is ""lord of the rings"" meets ""texas chainsaw massacre"". great production values married to a total gross,fest. let's see (obligatory spoiler alert, of course) though there's not much to spoil since i'm writing this now for a show that's been on six years. anyway, let's start. brother and sister having sex while the latter is married to the king, passing off their offspring as his. human babies being offered up to strange zombie-like creatures by a father who marries his own daughters. a torture scene involving rats, various body parts cut off, rape scenes, castration scenes, this is basically saw movie levels of entertainment. i'll give some credit for the first season for at least being original, as well as aforementioned high quality production values, but after that (i watched season 2 as well on dvd, then looked up the rest via summaries on the internet), and the basic theme doesn't change, really. it's basically what new kinds of shock scenes can they through at us without anything ever being resolved. good characters are killed (won't spoil it by saying which ones) and the rest basically scheme and backstab each other. think of the worst types of office politics only played with swords and various other medieval weapons. bleah! you feel like you want to wash out your brains with soap after coming into contact with this mess! 4 toilet bowls/barf bags up!"
2019-07-14,gelaos,"A great - but definitely not ""the greatest"" - show",9,"i haven't read the books and i avoided this series for a long time. but, shortly before last season, i succumbed. that means that i binge,watched de facto the entire series. it grew on me, although it wasn't as spectacular as i expected it to be. also, the amount of nudity and violence is absurd. calling got ""the greatest fantasy of all time"" etc. is completely unjustified. as the series went on, the production values increased, however the quality writing rapidly decreased.overall, game of thrones is a good adaptation (and in later seasons inspiration) of a good book series, nothing more. but it did deserve its moment in spotlight."

2020-04-14,beachbum2018,Lockdown binge - superb!,7,"watched this for the first time because of the lockdown, all episodes in less than 2 weeks. positives: superb tv series, fantastic cast and acting in general, great cgi, great wardrobe, plausible storyline not destroyed totally by unrealistic side plots, very realistic middle,age castles, knights, etc.
not so positives: unnecessary profligacy of sexual scenes in early series, over the top profanity throughout, far too much blood and guts, some unrealistic plot elements (dragons were marginal but necessary to the story), ice dead army too reminiscent of recent zombie movies like wwz), northern scenes shot in heavily greyed colours overdid the gloomy atmosphere bit, a bit too many dark dungeon / depth of the castle scenes, some overly-wandering waffly characters (eg littlefinger), pace was a bit slow at times!
nice touches: framed off uk medieval history, great analogy's (wildlings = scots, northmen = yorkshire / newcastle, westeros = irish, king's landing = south east / london area.... maybe... etc)..... which might have been lost on non-uk nationals, complicated storyline but it still didn't overwhelm, definitely entertaining.
overall one of the best tv series i've ever seen, superb cast and some of the best acting i've seen in a long time, very memorable!"
2012-07-17,jfcthejock,"Lord of The Rings Has Grown Up, Into A Darker Child",9,"game of thrones, is what i call dark fantasy and the books emphasise the dark side of fantasy amazingly by writer george rr martin, and the series of a song of ice and fire. when i heard about the books being made into a television show, i was new to it. i was one of many, coming to the world of westeros by the tv show first and not the books. the decision paid off well, and game of thrones amazed me until the final episode of the first season before i bought all the books and began to read them.game of thrones incorporates, what many fantasy shows such as earthsea and shows portraying the king arthur legends; the simple tact of darkness we all possess inside us to become the worst we can be. greedy, bloodthirsty, brutal and ambition. game of thrones gives us what the sopranos would have been in a fantasy, medieval setting such as the borgias is as well.depicting plots to take over the throne of westeros, ambition by princes, lords and lowly soldiers is always present as everyone has their own sense of what is owed to them and what is there's to take. a sense of being owed something by their subjects, and their people. simple individual men and women, who's ambitions cost the lives of thousands in the struggle for dominance.this is perfectly portrayed by hbo, and the writers of the show as every noble house have their own plans for the land who are just waiting for their opportunity to put their plans into action. the sets and design department, have got everything about the show to perfection and what most fans of the books imagine seeing is what they do see. characters are portrayed as they are in the books, and appear to embody their roles well.now with season two finished, and awaiting season three coming in 2013 we have a while to wait. but the show is simply, the sopranos or the wire in a mythical fantasy world. it's dark, gory and deeply seated in politics and religion as medieval times were similar."
2015-04-13,harun_karali,Valar Morghulis,4,"this tv show is like an artist drawing on his canvas, with every stroke a picture starts to emerge, and once you see a glimpse of what the whole picture looks like, it will be impossible to turn away.got is one of the, if not, the best tv show ever made, and it's all thanks to george rr martin, the author of the books. i have to warn you, if you intend on watching this show, then you are in for so many twists that it will make your head spin, towards the end of the first season you will get a peek into the dark and brilliant mind of grrm. this is a show that isn't afraid to take a step over the edge and drop you into a never ending free fall into an abyss and you will love every second of it."
2018-04-11,francogrex,"great show, great suspense",9,"only recently have i begun watching. i am into the fifth season. the story is great and the acting too. for me peter dinklage (tyrion lannister) is the hero of the series, he steals the spotlight very easily. the other main characters are very good too. i was also happily surprised when i realized that david benioff was the creator because i had read his excellent novel city of thieves and i understand now why got is as good as it is :). the original book of george r.r. martin must be also very good since it is the basis of the series. my original rating was 9 however i dropped it down to 7 because i believe (like many viewers) that it capitalized too much on cheap thrills such as graphic gore and violence and sex. there was no need for all that. it could have been as good and even better if it didn't pander too much to the lowest instincts of the worst human scum."
2019-05-03,florianlaur,A scary harbinger of the future,6,"despite having magic, dragons and supernatural creatures in it, it was much more plot, and character-driven. most of the charme came from smart conversations, like in jackie brown(imho the best tarantino movie, yet underrated because it doesn't have much action).one can say that i liked the show because it was different. it didn't mind to break with conventions, it didn't pander to what the majority expected and it didn't show you everything (like the battles), which made the few scenes with some sword fights all the more powerful.then came season 4 and season 5. the show started to slip and fast. basically with the death of tywin lannister, it said goodbye to everything that made it once great. the 2 best schemers(varys and littlefinger) who could have a show of their own and set in motion 90% of the plot left king's landing and hardly had any role in the show anymore.
the interesting characters with edges and flaws were killed off because the creators didn't like them(stannis). the way that was done was an insult to anyone who kept watching after that.the big threat that we should worry about were always the zombie-like creatures up north. who are they? where do they come from? why do they want to kill everyone?
don't hope for answers. the ""big threat"" is dealt with in one episode, of course without answers."
2019-05-20,iceman88869,This series is a 10 till the last season,3,"specifically the last two episodes of season eight. they went passed george rr martins writing and the show was tumbling down hill till the last two episodes. in the last two episodes, the writers single highhandedly destroyed the entire series. it's almost like jon snow and dany were just filler. jon ends up going to the wall again, even though he was the rightful heir to the throne. seriously, why even bring up that he was part targaryen? people finding out jon is targaryen was the climax of season seven! now it means nothing! i know i won't bother with any of the spin,offs. they will be the same writers that destroyed this show."
2021-03-10,diegocoda,They start perfect but finish awful,9,"the firsts 6 seasons is just a masterpiece of the series, but season 7 feels more little and i will not talk about the 8 because that was a boomer, just watch it is worthy but prepare for the end that is boring and predictable."
2020-10-11,criscal,"Starts great, ends in a disaster",4,"this was a fantasy show that i really liked in the first say five seasons. they had decent special effects, the story was complex and a big difference from the black and white in tolkien's book. the cast was the best you could buy on a not so big budget. i really liked peter dinklage's character. the big problem is that the book series was never finished before they did the final seasons and who knows if it ever will be. after the show ran out of the books, the showrunners made the story up badly. a lot of characters went around westeros in speed boats, the story line in a whole kingdom got cut brutally and it ended in the last horrible season. actors would pop out of nowhere as deus ex machina hitting the enemy side in total surprise, characters lost their character development and got back to season 1 mentally. a fight that everybody was expecting happened when it did not have any impact on the story at all. the whole story got wrapped in the worst possible way. every fan theory about the ending was more compelling than the actual result. and all because the showrunners rushed the result so they could be showrunners for star wars ..."

2016-08-09,paul-271,Silly Fantasy == Great Fun,8,"no doubt many take this show seriously because folks will take anything seriously. just attend any star trek convention to see what i mean. that doesn't mean the show the fans go nuts for isn't enjoyable or that the fans aren't having a great time. star trek in its many iterations had and has a lot going for it as does got. many whine and bleat about the sexual content or the violence or both. these complaints have merit in that the fact is that this series is dark ages violent and contains enough voyeuristic sex to keep any 12 year old boy going for months. the violence is hardly even up to the level that really has happened here on earth at most times in human history. the worst we see as warfare is a good deal less than, say, the vikings inflicted on the rest of europe for many years. the worst of the violence likely is a veiled slight at religion. at one point, a dad burns his wonderful daughter alive to appease a god. earlier, he did the same to many others not related to him. in another sub story we get a one on one torture , against nasty but also nothing that even approached what the inquisition did to its targets. the sex is just silly and childish. the only persistent real romance we have among adults is a long standing incestuous one between a brother and sister. the rest is either male homosexual grab me while i grab you or recreational friction. women have two states as adults. they can either be arch schemers or sex toys. the series persists in the laughable myth that a woman can be a long term prostitute and then, after 25 or so years of this, still appear to be a fresh as a daisy starlet. they also, for the most part, enjoy themselves immensely while servicing any male who wanders into their place of business. i suppose at graduation from high school girls are offered those two career paths. most seem to choose being a prostitute.all this goes on while the entire place is under threat of, believe it or don't, a zombie attack unless the dragons attack first. as i said, great fun."
2018-11-19,vivkon,Universe of Irrationality,10,"human irrationality became a subject of much research in the late 20th century. some of these researchers have already received the nobel prize. george martin captured this zeitgeist and developed his literary plot, in a song of ice and fire based on irrational behavior. his fantasy novels develop from the relative rationality of characters to absolute irrationality of characters, including story lines and ambience. however, if one remembers tolkien's fantasy universe, his universe develops from irrationality to rationality (perfectly matched with the history of renaissance). in the mid 20th century, one sees the peak of sci,fi literature. as a result of this, - we see the development in techniques and engineering resulting in the of creation bombs, and the discovery of new sources of energy and etc.). so, irrational realities became a focal point of literature, not only academic, but fictional as well. at the same time, tv series production brought a new wave of literature, revitalizing some literary traditions (also here is a good example of big little lies by liane moriarty). tv series have made available some literary characters and unread stories to a wider range of people, non circumscribed by national borders, ethnicity or other factors. the game of thrones, based on the works george martin, is a useful tv series which discovered the limits of irrationality human and non-human beings."
2014-10-26,ratcat0,Simply great for the most part but can be tiring and confusing,10,"actually i would give it 7.5 out of 10 if i could. it , to me was a bit like sons of anarchy in that it took a while to get in to and work out what is really happening. there are times when verbose confusing conversation dullens the sensual-ness of the awe inspiring scenery and sexy beyond words boys and girls. to clarify a point i have read in past reviews that this is set in a medieval time. no nothing can be further from the truth. medieval times were a set period in human history from the 5th to the 15th century. i don't recall ever when they specify the time or date in got, this is not human history it is fantasy that is 'reminiscent' of that time. the suggestion that there is too much gratuitous sex is also to my mind incorrect. there is indeed a lot of nudity and some sex but it isn't soft porn by any stretch of the imagination. the reason got sucks you in is that we develop personal likes and dislikes toward certain characters much like football teams and when a much loved character is murdered it seems almost unbelievable so of course your emotional side requires you to seek reprisal for the fallen by watching further until next thing you know the whole series is over. if it wasn't for the dull conversations about what king owns what land and did what to whom i would easily have given this 9.9 out of 10 but unfortunately that is not so."
2021-04-18,scar38,Far and away the best series I've ever seen.,10,"i'm currently binging every episode for the sixth time and it just gets better and better, the acting from everyone is phenomenal, especially emilia clarke who is mesmerising, i can't name everyone because there's too many standout performances. yes there is lots of violence and nudity but it just adds to the brilliance.anyone who hasn't seen this series should give it a go, i did and i was blown away.if i could give it 11 out of 10 i would, it's that good."

2021-05-27,marveller-66,AOT>GOT : My first GOT review,10,"i don't usually compare shows, but i did here, nonetheless. my comparison, deep below.where to begin? binge,watched the whole show within a month, about, maybe an year ago. watched with a mind that ""this is the supposed greatest show on television"" considering the popularity and rating. it honestly blew my mind. watched above 32 tv shows in the last couple of years including aot, breaking bad, etc.) thought this was overrated but no. it really is a remarkable show until the final season arrived. people are complaining that it was fantastic until season 6. i don't buy it. season 7 too was fantastic. but the 8th one just changed everything. it shifted the whole consideration about this show worldwide. ""the iron throne"" episode has a user review of 7,800 in imdb. above 7000? that is just crazy.i tried not to hate on the final season. i really tried not to...but it's severely bad. and i'm not just saying because our favorite character just lost her cool. even that is understandable but they could have added more to it, at least.to me, season 8 is mediocre because of it's bland and flat pacing, lack of content, primary characters being useless, overly-long running time and all of these combined with top-notch cgi. really, what was even the point of jon's huge reveal in season 6? that was like one of the most relevant part in all of got and it didn't matter at the end.i'm not pointing out any particular awful sequences for there is a lot. still, i gotta say this. the long awaited and the most anticipated tv episode of 2019 or maybe of all time didn't reached it's potential. i'm talking about ""the long night"". considering the incredible events happened before, i never thought it'd be something so ordinary.considering the last season, i've changed my mind about game of thrones (got) being on top of my list. the greatest show i've ever watched is attack on titan (aot). and i'm not considering it as an anime. make aot more popular because it's an unbelievably remarkable show. maybe, one of best ever on tv platform. i recommend a 100% for that show instead of got's final season.my rating : aot - 9.5
(season 1 : 9.3)
(season 2-4(part i) : 9.8)got - 9.1
(season 1-7 : 9.4)
(season 8 : 7.2)"
2019-05-21,maakus,From epic to terrible.,5,"if david benioff and d.b. weiss hadn't totally ruined the final seasons, got would've all in all been an easy 9 or a 10. the first four seasons is carefully building something amazingly epic , then and for future episode- all of which is totally thrown out the window in the final seasons. with result in hand, i don't think i would recommend this show to anyone. sure, if you want to see some world class drama; watch season 1-4 and maybe even partially season 5-6. but after that, expect to be where i'm at right now. hugely disappointed and questioning if i wasted my time with this show.i'm not gonna give the entire show a 1 rating like many others seems to do - probably out of angers. there's so much great that has been done here. but i can't avoid the fact that d&d dragged the entire show down with the utterly stupid, rushed and disrespectful (to fans and everybody involved) last two seasons."
2013-04-17,teutonfirst,Season 3,8,"while season 1 was awesome, breath taking, the quality decreased with the next 2 seasons. i don't know why they stick with 10 episodes format, there is too much information, events and characters in the books to be properly summaries in 10 episodes. (and i must say this, don't read the book before seeing this tv show, will ruin it for you, well except the first season of course.). many shows hit the inspirational bump on their road and have a hard time to invent new content. got don't have that problem, there is content in the books to keep it running for years, why intentionally make it shorter ? or remove content ? devon had 4 sons, the bastard that torture greyjoy has a full story behind, new characters just pop out with no background and is harder to follow the action even for me, the wife of the king over the wall is missing, as well as her sister, no romantic relation between snow and the red girl while in the book was the supreme condition of his oath breaking as a knight of the night watch, the connection between boys and their wolves is barely mentioned, never shown when they take control of their pets, ser dontos is the one approaching sansa to help her escape and many more, while adding stuff that was never there, rose the ""entertaining lady"", dragon kidnapping. i understand that they want to make some things a little different than the book, but at least make it better. ( rose is great addition btw) :) . the quality of this show tends to diminish lately, they failed to bring up the effects of the war over the provinces, the famine, the horrors, the dead, the robbers, the famine again, aria and her companions are really chubby =/, hard to achieve that feeding on roots ."
2019-05-17,jdiz115,Phenomenal Show,10,i don't know if another show can live up to this one. a new standard of greatness. seriously each episode feels like a film. season 8 is ass though.
2020-04-27,scottsideasare,Great series until...,10,"...a great series until the writers ran out of source material and had to plot for themselves. seasons 1,6 were great, then they ran out of source material from george r martin to adapt. left with outlines only, the writers floundered in season 7, and in the 8 th just gave up trying at all. season 8 is an embarrassment of writing and seriously, they should be ashamed. as should the editors for sloppy work that resulted in coffee cups and water bottles visible. i guess they were all too busy cashing cheques to notice. a pathetic end to a great story."
2021-08-11,margineanvladdaniel,A well deserved place where it is now and where it should be forever,8,"not my personal favorite and saw it after it was finished and i knew most of the things that happened. that didn't stopped me and didn't stop me to enjoy it. a very complex series and many characters and developments of them. that was a very unique, very big. it made history. still does. i don't know why is all the drama about the last season, but depends on perspectives, i liked it, it was realistic and shows should be made like this. it's a fictive universe that had many relevant situations that could apply to reality so the ending was expectable. looking forward for more projects. well done again, hbo!"
2020-01-29,fajarsantoso,Whats not to like of GoT?,1,"i love got. in fact, whats not to like? innocent people being murdered, women, children, even a baby. people being decapitated and sliced apart and the women, my goodness! they are either being used to consumate the relationship the man has with that women or they are wifes that you can slap and treat them like slaves.perfect show, i can watch it with no qualms cause i know it is ""television"".on a serious note, i don't understand why all the fuzz is all about. 6*"

2019-01-07,oovag,Disappointing,9,"the first season is excellent, astonishing, considering how ordinary the literary source is. i was excited. the second season has been cruelly disappointing. i have spared myself the following seasons."
2019-05-22,mmevanille-53097,Rushed End to an almost Flawless series,9,"i rate all shows i watch. until series 8 episode 4, got was only one of two current shows i believe deserving of 10 stars.for me series 6 was the highlight. although there wasn't as much death in that series, the depth of the stories and the development of the character arc's was amazing.series 7 felt slightly rushed. for me, it was missing an episode. there were also some plot holes opening up especially in regard to euron's magical fleet.but series 8 was disappointing. again i feel that there was almost an episode missing. one that more closely examined dany's spiral, vary's martyrdom and once again euron's magical fleet. for the latter in trying to create an antagonist, they did it at the expense of realism, which was a hallmark of the first 6 series.had those three key factors been included in an additional episode, i believe that there would not be as much resentment from fans regarding the series. the episode should have been a lengthening of events contained in episode 4 and the start of episode 5.firstly it would have made dany's total character flip somewhat more understandable. had the additional episode been a story of her spiral, of paranoia of betrayal and of mourning her closest fallen friends, viewers may have been more likely to be divisive over her decisions in episode 5, but instead it felt like it was too far removed from her character arc. jon dispatching in the final episode would also have been more impactful if there was more debate and acknowledgement of dany's mental state during episode 5. the discussion of the decisions of both these characters could have even with everything else aside, made this series outstanding.same with varys who is one of the more intelligent men in the series. it was almost like he was asking to die ( it was prophesized earlier in the series so they had to make it happen somehow) . an additional episode could have delivered his story more subtly and believably.jaime's decision to stand by cersei in the end was questionable as well, although i believe that this one is probably one of the lesser qualms. people in real life do make decisions against their better judgement so i will suspend belief in this one.i will also make a note that the writers d&d upon hearing that fans were upset, accused the fans of ""not watching it properly"". apparently they wrote it to be an emotional journey. i would just like to say that an emotional journey is fine, even if it does sound like artsy trash, but you cannot dismiss rational story telling, long standing character arcs and realistic conclusions, just to portray a particular emotion for entertainment value. its treating the viewer like a moron (shooting through rocks anyone?). the viewer can only suspend belief so much."
2019-05-10,wolfghostninja,Final season represents the show's nadir.,10,"trying ones best to be objective, the first 3 or 4 seasons of this show were quite brilliant, but since then it's decline has been difficult to watch. now in the final season, there is really no need to watch the series to its conclusion, because the second half of the show can safely be ignored as poor writing reduces a groundbreaking show to bold and the beautiful levels of quality.the ending doesn't matter because the ethos of the show has been abandoned as the producers chase hype not excellence. gone is the subtlety that marked got as something truly different, instead it is big, loud, cheesy, and predictable. pure convention in other words. characters lose their characteristics, and inconvenient plot threads shoved aside in favour of standard hollywood b movie schlock.as a whole, despite the riveting first few seasons, the show eventually collapses on itself, and is a chore to watch from season 7 onwards.if you haven't seen it yet, avoid the disappointment."

2018-09-12,patlightfoot,Can't wait for Series 8,5,"years ago, i watched the first series, i was not impressed, too violent and too many full frontal ladies. however, my son kept saying 'watch series 2 and 3, you'll love it'. well i did and do love it.not only the cinematography, special effects (particularly, love those dragons), but the editing and particularly the script, it is superior. the main actors are without doubt, experienced and brilliantly cast. peter particularly is outstanding, and commands his scenes. that sounds unfair to the others but they all hold their own so well, and equally. the collection of true historical events, closely resembles the borgias of rome, when italy was divided by provinces and war like. and to a point the war of the roses, that ended with henry vll, and the start of the tudor line. i like the way the actors from 'the north' usually have english north of england accents. as a student of film studies at university level, i find it hard to fault the series, unless you realize that the dark ages and medieval period was as violent and unscrupulous as it is presented don't watch it. mind you the 'r' rating should warn you, this is not a series for youngsters.well done all those involved in this production i hope the final series leaves us satisfied with he outcome."

> in mid - later seasons, some episodes were so full of action, drama, impending doom, that i wanted to pause the show for a break, yet i couldn't stop watching. you're glued, fixated by the amount of stuff happening, it bowls you over. you've got your hands up by your face b/c you're in awe, shock or disbelief .
> they have you on the edge of your seat for the entire episode that it's kind of overwhelming. i found myself saying things out loud like, oh my god, wtf, or partially covering my eyes b/c i was afraid what might happen.
> some of the characters are complete psychopaths and/or narcissistic and others are the best thing since sliced bread. you love the good ones so much that with every fight scene you're holding your breath praying to the lord of light that they don't die!!
the bad ones are so good at being bad that you cannot wait for them to get killed and you cheer when it finally happens or you're mad b/c they were killed too quickly and deserved to suffer more.

2020-06-23,holliswoods,"Wasn't Perfect, but it was still great!",10,"game of thrones was unlike anything that has ever been on television. the story, the characters, the world, the music, the costumes, the filming locations , this will go down, and already has, as one of the greatest shows in history. that being said - it was not without its flaws and it was far from perfect, especially in the final seasons. but even in its worst moments, i still enjoyed it to some extent.sean bean paved the path of the amazing story that is game of thrones. the first few seasons painted the picture and set up arcs that are followed through the series. but from the red wedding until cersei took the iron throne, the show was nothing more than art.i went into season 7 & 8 already knowing what happens in the end & knowing how people feel about it, so i watched season 7 carefully. the seeds that led to everything wrong with season 8 were planted in season 7. there was a huge criticism that season 8 had plot points that came from nowhere but watching those last seasons back to back with prior knowledge, i can confirm that that was not the case. one word to describe season 7 would be 'shaky,' while season 8 was a total collapse. i still enjoyed the final season overall, but because of the weak writing from the 7th season, season 8 paid the price.things i liked: the characters & their talented actors, the insane world building & history, the music & costumes, & the insanely epic battles. things i didn't like: horrible pacing due to too many things going on, nonsense squabbles between characters that just waste time, and the nudity in this show gave me anxiety that someone could look over and think i'm watching x rated content.a story is only as good as its character. and game of thrones had no shortage of great characters. honestly, the characters were the most important aspect of the show, and i have some feelings to share: daenerys, mother of dragons. i believed in her, i really did. seasons 1-6 gave her great character development and was an empowering tale to behold. but once she set sail for westeros, you could immediately see the cracks. and when it was time to make a choice, she went too far and never came back. i still lover her, and i still thing she's one of the most iconic characters of all time. but i, like tyrion lannister, was very disappointed in the choices she made, though justified after everything she lost, i just wish it ended differently.the lannisters.... oh boy. first of all, tyrion lannister had such a great story arc from start to finish. he rose from shame & scrutiny, and even though he was ashamed of his mistakes at the end, he was a real hero. peter dinklage carried the show on his shoulders and never gave up the opportunity to give a great performance. the same could be said about lena headey. cersei is one of my favorite villains. even if she was immoral and evil with every breath, i cheered for her until the end. she was the one i loved to hate. it was heartbreaking watching her death scene. i was so upset with the daenerys & all i wanted was for her to escape. her death was dumb. she deserved far worse than just death by collateral damage. and jaime..... he was one of my other favorite characters, but he was a fool. he was in the right place; he should've never gone back to king's landing. of course he was following tyrion's advice, and he almost made it, but he didn't. daenerys caused the chamber to collapse, but his decisions led him there. i'm very disappointed. the reasoning was there, but the execution is was poor.quick honorable mentions to davos, samwell, jorah, theon, varys, bronn, & tormund. these guys had amazing story arcs. tormund, davos, & bronn had such charisma and were at times the bright side to a scene. and applause to sir brienne of tarth! she was the greatest warrior westeros had ever seen and i'm so proud that she earned a fitting ending.now. this show started with the starks. and it ended with the starks. there has been debate about who the ""main characters"" were, well, the stark family was the center of the story. sansa started as a brat and developed into a wise & strong woman & queen. bran... is the three eyed raven, and is now king of the six kingdoms.... he was weird, but he was important. arya stark started off as a rambunctious little girl, and went on the become an assassin, survived the destruction of king's landing, and became a world explorer. out of all the endings, hers was the most satisfying, and she is definitely one of the best characters. and jon snow. whether he was a bastard son, or king of the north, or the rightful heir to the iron throne, he always tried to do what was right no matter his title. he was a war hero who fought with honor and courage. he fought so that people could live. his story is one heck of a story, and there's nothing more to say. but if ned stark lived to see where his surviving children (and nephew) ended up, he'd be proud.do i recommend this show? absolutely. it was not perfect, but as i said, the starks were the main characters, and watching the credits role on the finale was most satisfying. it's an exhausting tale, but it's worth it to watch it at least once. even though the final seasons fell flat, that does not diminish the fact that game of thrones was a great show."

2018-12-30,mvictorpjinsiste,The New Fantasy Standard,7,"at the time of its publishing, tolkien's lord of the ring started out a reborn round of fantasy that took its elements from wagner's operas and nordic legends. it was so powerful that it dominated the scene it created in novels, movies and games for more than 60 years. until now.gone now are the elves, wizards, fair maidens and magical swords: gone is the black and white morality; this is the new fantasy standard, a fantasy that's rich in intrigue, conflicting sides, shades of gray and less,than-noble sentiments. g martin put the human element back into the fantasy setting, after tolkien took it out. we can now talk about ""realistic fantasy"".the first seasons shows the usual early mistakes these series have, as they throw things against the wall to see what sticks to it. it this case, the first season features exagerated hostility, obnoxious synthetisers, too many exploitative boudoir scenes and bizzare wigs, things that will be progressively pulled out or done with more subtility in the later ones.i don't not grant 9s easily - but this is something historic we're witnessing here and now. a necessary add-on to any fantasy setting or politics aficionados' library out there."

2020-03-08,jcarlos-96740,One of the best series ever made,10,"for me it's one of the best series ever made and yes i know about the polemic last season but to be honest the last season had amazing episodes with amazing scenes, obviously that it was a rushed final but that was only hbo fault, about the ending i think it was a good and expectable ending , keep in mind that the last books haven't came out yet so the producers didn't have books to follow like in the previous seasons and they consulted the creator about the end and followed the lines that he gave to them, the final is like the own creator said it would be... bittersweet! but let's not allow that to ruin this iconic series that will always be a classic. you know how great this was when the big question is: ""which serie will become the next game of thrones?"". this is just legendary!"
2018-03-02,shinedowness,Watered Down Shock Value,8,"this show is worse than grrm's books to me. what ramsay bolton and other characters have done in the novels have been watered down shock value in game of tones,it-down-too-much-for-me. instead we get a pretty actor named iwan rheon who doesn't let us see what ramsay's fully capable of. the creators of this politically correct show won't let us. also, the martells' character quality in a storm of swords were slaughtered in got thanks to skipping to ""more"" important plots. oberyn martell's character was at least spared from being boring to me both in the book and this abomination i'm reviewing. by the way, i think iwan rheon is a great actor but thought he could have done more. and i think peter dinklage, aiden gillen, kit harrington, maisie williams, etc. are all great actors. though, they aren't enough for me here."
2013-11-27,asifzamir,WOW this is an amazing TV series,9,"have you ever watched a show so good that you try to get your friends to watch it to? game of thrones is that show.game of thrones premiered 2011 on hbo and i was lucky enough to watch it then. usually i don't catch these great shows until they are almost done. game of thrones setting is the seven kingdoms of westeros and follows struggles between the nobles for the iron throne. ensuing threats continue on in essos and the north. a main inspiration for the series is from european history including england's wars of the roses between 1455,1485. the series delves into western high medieval europe. this show is based on books and had a massive budget to start, plus plenty of promotion. the show has been parodied by famous comedians and has a cult following. this will be one of those shows that people will be sad to see end. - asif zamir"
2019-06-08,askeland89,"The show that could do no wrong, or so I thought.",10,"gonna keep it short and simple: game of thrones was close to perfect until season 6. it simply just got better and better and i thought they could do no wrong. sadly, season 7 and 8 was nowhere near as complex in terms of writing. granted season 7 had it's moments but it was in no way an improvement over the previous seasons. the dialogue felt out of place in most cases and the writing was somewhat lazy. which brings me to season 8 where it all fell apart. yes, it had pretty visuals but that's about it for the positives. it hurts me to say it but it was rushed and the script ( or lack thereof ) was plain awful. it got the the point where i no longer cared who lived or died. for me the show ended at season 6 episode 10 , the winds of winter. and for that i will remember it fondly.game of thrones could have been the greatest show in television history, sadly it refused to stay the course."
2014-02-03,havewisdomwilltravel,Misogynistic Snuff Gorefest Showcasing GOT Creator's Anger Issue & Tiny Little Imagination,8,"summing up... plenty of female body parts rivaling french soft porn but without the french's artfulness or equal showing of male organs. plenty of blood and exposed putrid rotting flesh and corpses without meaning or humor or joy. end result: a feudal,era porn and modern-day snuff offering, by the jaded, for the jaded.sure. this show has emotional intensity and well-paced plot. overall top notch, coherent screen writing, directing, art direction, and editing. superb, world class, diverse, highly talented cast. regardless, there are still characters to root for, john snow, arya among others. with all these top ingredients in place, game of thrones could have easily been enthroned a 21st century classic in decades to come. but it's already rotting from inside out.intelligent viewers know there are so many ways to show the act of killing, copulation, psychological evil and human depravity. they also know when they are being manipulated a d assaulted by the story-teller.why stoop so low, dear writers and producers? truth is the game of thrones writing team could've been more confident, more selective and artful. they should realize by the 6th episode they don't have to stoop to the level of the lowest common denominator to get attention. yet they continue to choose the easiest and shortest path: aggressive, sadistic, full-frontal, in-your-face gratuitous vomit-inducing scenes of rotting flesh, endless explicit images of female debasement and equally vicious performance of male castration. game of thrones has become primary about how far to push the envelope of tastelessness, ""creativity"" in sadistic ideas and imagery, flaunting of the ugliest human depravity, while great story-telling has become secondary. oh and i say this as an non-religious sort and fan of dexter and breaking bad with their ample blood and gore and explicit sex violence and psychological darkness. key female characters had to strip to be on the show, in compromising and demeaning positions, so why stop there? why not go all the way? why are male organs spared? why are some females in the show spared the fate of unceremonious nudity, others had to go on all fours and banged like mere beasts? the writers acted like they spare no-one in this story universe, enjoyed having the power to rip off clothes from all the actresses they cast because they can, because majority of male audience would supposedly cheer them on. but the celebratory and bloody multiple stabbing of a pregnant defenseless woman through her late term fetus in the womb in explicit detail is our idea of fun and entertainment? men enjoy it? really? if the writer directors had fun writing, constructing and witnessing that scene, the devil has gotten to them. the devil grinned at the audience many times during the red wedding, through the creators who have long crossed the line of decency.by design these *unnecessary* exhibition of sadistic inhumanity and psychological filth will attract a certain kind of audience - the blood-thirsty, filth-lusting, repressed sadist sorts. they will deify this show, for their beastly lusts are being reflected right on prime time tv. we will never know if got is popular because it is a piece of great timeless art because, got writer-directors have sold out long ago. shame. this show could have been a 21st century cultural legend, outdoing lord of the rings and everything in the genre. could have been.15 apr 2014 update just watched the latest... dialogs becoming more current-day urban londoner street slang and unnatural for got world. more naked female bodies on cheap display, while male vital body parts remain cowardly hidden. 3x jump in females being debased and slaughtered, and scenes starring young girl corpses. that's got writer's idea of boundary-pushing.everyday misogynists and child snuff consumers shall rejoice. minus 2 more stars. hey the cowardly got creators - might as well go for male organ full-frontal, pedophilia and full-on incest orgies. come on, don't be such cowards. what you guys are doing is not real boundary-pushing, but merely going way back to the most regressive and cannibalistic era of feudal rome.borrowing from fantasized tv story rome or the real romans is not very creative is it? got is supposed to be a fantasy, not a humorless documentary featuring *historical studies in female subjugation & male sadism*?lame...and progressively lamer..."
2021-02-03,theproteangirl,Still Mad At Season 8 Garbage,10,"this show was great. had everything you liked in medival setting film. i liked everything and was so into the whole idea of bron being on some cool adventourus path and that the directors will make it some co stoyline how he will save everyone with his visions and so on. boy was i wrong. i watched season 8 live when it came out and i was in utter shock. how could dumb and dumber have been so lazy and ruined such a huge part of their lives and the biggest show in the world at the time because they had other projects??! i just hate those two because now the season 8 is set in stone and will forever tarnish this shows good rep. they just wrapped it and went home, no care on the shows legacy. i wish the ending wouldve been something epic, so sad and mad it wasn't."
2019-05-23,skepticalsy,One of the greatest,1,"the only reason i gave this brilliant and mammoth fantasy fiction tv series 9 out of 10 and not 10/10 was season 8.for seven seasons i was thoroughly entertained, engaged, and admiring, and despising, the well developed characters.however, it's sad to say, season 8 and the final few episodes really disappointed me. all that build up, all those years of watching with great anticipation lead me to a place where i said out loud ""is that it? is that all we get?""others may disagree but i am very disappointed."
2019-05-20,dagros,"At times the best show of all times, but uneven and too many seasons",10,"all that can be said about this epic show has already been said in all the reviews here. got is a truly milestone in tv history. all these fantastic characters, scenery and ruthless strategic and tactic powerplay. also a great thing that the supernatural and fantasy is there in some context, but only very limited. which makes it more ""believable"" and also more thrilling. all these fantastic characters and actors in the same show, that is really unique for got and has not (and never will be?) sen in any other show.there are many episodes in got and the series is quite uneven. first seasons are outstanding, then middle seasons losing some ground and focus and later seasons getting better again. now and then the pace in the show can feel quite slow bounding to boring. but then something unexpected happens and you sit one the edge of your seat again..last season 8 was a disappointment. no particular interesting development of character and intrigue. it was more a big epic ending battle with all bells and whistles. anyhow the ending made sense and the final scene intelligently weaving it all together.got will rank in the top 10 of tv series of all times for a long time to come."
2019-05-16,malshebangg,The best show on the TV forever,9,the best show on the tv forever........................................................
2019-10-12,salinaqvi,Let's not talk about you know what,8,"game of thrones for all intents and purpose is a excellent tv show that sits up there with the sopranos, breaking bad and the wire as some of the best television has to offer. the show does an wonderful job crafting its story and making us feel for every character (both in a good and a bad way), even when there is nothing going on, the show still finds way to keep your eyes glued to the screen wanting to find out what will happen next. now for the elephant in the room, it's true, season 8 is utter garbage. each episode of that dreadful season leaves you scratching your head wondering what you just had witnessed and figuring out what happened to some of your favourite characters. so in conclusion, s1,7 are some of the best television has to offer, s8 is something that you should just forget even exists and that will make your viewing experience much better."
2021-08-06,koceny,War of the Roses and other (bedtime) stories,8,"couldn't pass the second season. started ok, but by the end of 2nd season became more and more boring.started to fall asleep at every episode, it was too much effort to stay awake. i guess i was watching it just because m. c. waldau, but it's not enough to watch this boredom till the end of the show... fantasy is not my cup of tea, no matter how much i wanted to like it. everybody liked it, except me. i wanted to belong😆anyhow, i congratulate this epic effort to make such a gigantic project possible. wish they made such an effort with some actual historic story, instead of fairy princess stories.."
2019-05-20,therapeuticsuicide,MOST DISAPPOINTING ENDING OF ALL TIME.,10,"the way game of thrones pulls you in from the outset is a tremendous achievement in entertainment, to be sure. the narrative continues to churn and twist, flexing it's impressive potential pretty well right up to the end. then the writing simply caves in on itself for one of the most disappointing finales you will ever see of any show of this caliber in which you could imagine investing 8 years of anticipation of what you could only assume, judging by the standards it sets for itself, would be a final, glorious, fulfilling conclusion to a sweeping epic. to give this series a 7/10 absolutely required that the first 7 seasons, and perhaps the first 6 episodes of season 8, merit a 9/10, because the finale in the last 2 episodes was, at a generous best, worth maybe a 4/10 or 5/10...at best. it truly felt like the writers had neither the tact nor talent to fulfil the narrative and bailed out in a panic, delegating the task to their children as a homework assignment. considering the expectations and investment, this has to rank quite easily as one of the most disappointing endings to any kind of story that i have ever known. pathetic."
2019-07-26,guenterfmang,Basically a perfect series BUT,6,"the last season destroyed much of the magic. nevertheless 9 stars for the whole series, 5 stars for the last season."
2021-02-27,jochemunlimited,Knights and stuff,2,"overall i give this show an 8. at first i did not like it so much, this was just a medieval show. don't get me wrong, i really like those shows, but i expected fantasy. ofcourse it is fantasy and many books are written with mostly medieval stuff in it, but it is not always my cup of tea. you can call all medieval stories/books/films fantasy. i see got more as fiction, but let's have not a big discussion on this.so for me there is not so much fantasy, but when i let those thoughts go out of my head, i really enjoyed the show. the acting is good, storytelling is good, decor/camera/costumes etc. are looking good, the action feels like it could be real. the story is a bit difficult to follow for me, but it is nice to see it again. characters are being killed.later on there is coming more and more as i would say: fantasy. but it is never a thick layer, it is mostly subtle. it changed for me when snow was killed and brought back to life. for me that changed the show and it was going up and down. suddenly there was a dip in pace and the story was boring. and characters keep coming back that should have been dead. and the action suddenly starting to be unrealistic. there were heroes and bad guys, huh? and they could not die like all the other people and they can take a lot of punishment.i don't remember which season exactly, but this is what i can remember. so first i was very connected with this show, i was waiting for the next episode. but i lost interest and i could more and more what would happen. things were solved easily, it fellt rushed. there should have been more depth. big example is the army of walkers. that was a big anticlimax. they were so strong and a fierce and suddenly it is over. no explanation why they are there etc. or i missed it?but still i think it is must see. especially when you like medieval. half way you must decide if you keep on watching ;)."
2019-04-11,theforceofsu,I don't get it,9,"i do not understand all the hype for this show. the first season is more about porn than anything else. later that kinda fades away, and when characters are not walking naked it's actually s decent show. but that's it, i don't see anything special about it.edit: last season ruined the few things that the show had going for it. it did not get one star simply because there were interesting episodes in a few seasons so i couldn't get muself to do it. but it deserves one star. writing in last few seasons is simply horrible."
2019-05-24,r-fronimides,"Could be the best TV show of all times, but...",9,"...it was a fantasy lore of the... ""dynasty"" or ""dalas"" shows!let me write this first: the 96,97% of the films i'm watching are fantasy (like lord of the rings) and sci-fi (like starwars or aliens or interstellar and such). therefore, a tv show like this one - the ""game of thrones"" - should be my very top no1 on my list and the best tv show i ever watched!... true? nope! the best is ""battlestar galactica"" (the newest version)...why ""got"" failed to be for me the best of all times tv shows?
like i wrote... it turned from a tv ""lord of the rings-like"" fantasy epic adventure, to a fantasy lore... ""dynasty"" or ""dalas""! why so so so sooooo many endless talks??? the 90% of the episodes are characters talking each other and the rest are (amazing & epic) battles/action scenes! we needed far far far more action scenes, and less (far far far) less talking scenes. we had so many characters, opened/exposed to the audience, with so many conversations, that after a bit you was ""loosing"" yourself and couldn't remember a bloody thing!
especially after a season ending, when the next was starting, you needed to see at least two last episodes to remember the damn plot!...as for the last episode that everybody hated, i found it super amazing and as it should be! personally, everything i dreamed or imagined about the end, took actual place in the final episode!!!bran as high king? obviously! after the amazing survivor of a cripple boy to the hard north and becoming that supernatural being ""3-eye raven"", it was obvious that bran will be something majestic... now, why the actual character (bran) was so boring and nobody (audience) cared about??? that's something hbo needs to answer, how much they failed to exposed a so great character and left him in his empty ""misery"".
but it was obvious that bran will be something great and i was hoping to be the high king.sansa as the ultimate lord of the north, the ""frozen queen"" (elsa? hello!)...? of course! after surviving so many suffering, i was pretty sure sansa will kick some dozen @sses at the end - and so she did!arya becoming an adventurer, alone? super obvious too.kalisi turning to bloody tyrant probably even worst than queen lanister?
obvious too!... having that end? super obvious.snow not having happy end? of course! it was something to expecting it.tyrion (probably by far the best character of the show) to finally survive and becoming something powerful (hand of high king)? was expected too.and finally... the starks kicking @sses at the end, the final winner house?
of course it was obvious and happy about it....therefore, the final episode was exactly what i was expecting from the show. the only hard and pure ""veto"" of mine is,... that the show needed two (at least) more seasons to be perfect! that's why is not the best for me and that's why i gave 7 stars. the 8th season was by far the most boring of all, except of course the last 2 episodes. why they hurry up so much to end it? hbo knows better to answer, but the 8th season's plot/scenario was childish and fast-done on a ...bus ride while returning back home after the gym!in few words:got is one of the best tv shows ever been! could be the ultimate best, but hbo failed to expand that gem more."
2018-04-22,ellimic,A brilliant series,3,"game of thrones was well into its fifth season when i started watching it from my dads dvd's and i loved it. george r.r. martin is brilliant at the intricate storylines of each character and group, then weaving them in and amongst one,another, it takes some thinking about to remember all the strands (and the character names especially) but i can't wait for the next series"

2015-07-10,merpman-94402,Disappointment from a lover of the books,10,"i bought and read game of thrones the year it came out. i was hooked, bought and read each book the week it came out. book 4 left us wondering what was going on, where we were going, but book 5 put us right back on track.martin is an extraordinary writer, with extraordinary vision. but as a lover of the book series, i cannot love the hbo series.as a stand alone series its second to none, with incredible characters, story and acting, but it has begun to stray so far from the books now, it has destroyed the books.the first series stayed very true, as did the second, but after that it strayed, and the latest series, well, i could not finish watching it.i would not recommend reading the books if you watched the series, or watch the series if you read the books. now i understand that most books do not convert directly to the screen. lotr was a classic example of this, and peter jackson (barring a couple of epic failures) did an incredible job (though he murdered the hobbit). but game of thrones you could have converted 99% to screen and not deviate almost at all.sadly i wish i had not watched the series now, as i feel i will not enjoy book six as much (if it ever arrives)."
2019-05-20,tomtalbotty,What a magnificent gem that is such a work of art you will not be disappointed when watching this TV Show with lots of twists and turns along the way. Spin Offs Here we Come:D,9,"well i have just officially watched the game of thrones season 8 finale episode 6 the finale every game of thrones season and episode. wow it has been a very long journey the many years that game of thrones has been on especially following the amazing such talented actors growing up on screen. this show has been a masterpiece and loved it from the start as i binged watched season 1 to 6 of game of thrones a few years ago then fell on love with it from the start. well the finale was ok and did not go exactly how i wanted it to go, nevertheless i am so happy that they have left it open to spin offs and prequals as leaving alot unexplained in this massive magical world of dragons and kingdoms. overall very happy with some of the awesome parts about the ending especially winterfell and hopeing for a arya spinoff to game of thrones as we really do want to know what is beyond the maps and what is west of westeros. also many more spin offs and prequals such as about the last dragon and about winterfell now as amazing as ever. one of my favourite tv shows and this gem is so unique that it is in it's own category with amazing plot, action and amazing realistic emotional acting. here's to game of thrones prequals and spin offs."

2020-02-12,cgtam,Great series,8,this series ended too soon. there were so many options to go after its last season. several spinoffs are certainly possible. there is a reason why it became a global phenomenon.
2020-04-25,xuefeiding,Game of power is a medieval epic fantasy drama in the United States.,9,"the plot structure is complete, the details are rich, and the creativity is infinite. on the premise of maintaining the flavor of the original, the tv play is more concise and the key points are more prominent. the characters of the play are bright and wonderful. the whole play is not only magnificent in scenes and exquisite in production, but also exquisite in photography, clothing, setting and art. the plot integrates a variety of elements and is dressed in magic. however, it reflects the real world in the illusion, and focuses on the struggle of political power."
2013-04-25,carmachan,"Amazing sets, solid performances, difficult epic to follow but worth it!",10,"after two people i respect suggesting that i might like game of thrones, i decided to watch the pilot, since i have hbo on demand and was all caught up on my favorite series. i offer this feedback for the filmmakers of this series and others, and for future potential fans:i found it difficult to follow, but it was worthy of my patience, and i was genuinely intrigued by certain characters. i know some cgi artists who are crazy for the opening and understand their feelings,-i find the opening does a disservice in that it fails to set the tone, it is confusing and has too many little details distracting from what you really need to know. if you want to compare openings that really capture the essence and set the tone - compare this one to vikings (history channel) and homeland (showtime channel). after catching up recently, i am still pretty confused about where things are and what's what culturally, but it doesn't matter - one need not have it all figured out to appreciate the real stories, which are the relationships between the people, not the cities or clans. the names are hard to remember, and again, it doesn't matter. it's still interesting even though i can't remember many of the names.it fascinates me that the writer is still working out the future of this series - the books are not all written - so even the book fans do not know what is going to happen, ultimately. is it a spoiler to say that above all, i cannot wait to see... oh, yes, that would be a spoiler... starts with a d. note to hbo: wow!!! amazing sets, costuming, overall production scale is absolutely stunning, the crew and producers should be extremely proud of what you have created."
2019-04-02,benowen-91207,Yes I'm a sheep,5,"game of thrones was something i would have never expected to be this good. nearly everything is fantastic in this show and it's writing is just sharpest. there will never be another show that thinks it's alright to kill its main characters and that is what makes the show great. go watch game of thrones, yes it is a lot but you will not regret it"
2014-07-31,varun_120,One of the best shows,6,"i delayed watching this show for a long time. and i regret it. it has to be the best shows out there. acting is superb, plot is good too. and, shock value is extreme. some people complain that their favorite characters are getting killed. but this is what makes them different from other shows. its unpredictability is its usp.seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of westeros. this is what the plot in short is. we come to see betrayals, seduction, secrets, loyalty etc. there are a lot of people who complain about nudity, but there is not that much. but yes its show meant for the adults. every season comes up with new twists and turns. i finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks. and now looking forward to the 5th season. 10/10 for me."
2020-11-14,frantzen79,Where to start...,1,"as you can tell from my rating i am not one of this shows many dedicated fans. actually it was my girlfriends persistency to have me watch it, that made me watch the whole thing instead of stopping after first season as i initially did.i can easily see the things people like about the show. the production value is amazing and the acting is second to none. to that extend i can't put a finger on it. but the shere amount of horrible people doing horrible things for a horrible amount of time where just too much for me. people didn't like the writing towards the end. i wasn't impressed with it from the beginning. with that being said i didn't hate it, there where a few characters that i enjoyed following and watching the whole thing, you get invested wether you like it or not. and towards the end i did consider giving it a 7.
then came the dreaded season 8... and what is interesting is, i didn't really think it was that different from the rest to begin with... (ok ""the long night"" was pretty silly), but the last 2 episodes were just horrible. first of all talk about making the most depressing end ever. and second of all what was the purpose of anything leading up to it, if that was the way it should end? all we had watched untill then didn't really matter in the end. several characters development up to that point were just flushed down the toilet. downright embarrasing writing. i have to agree with the fanbase there."
2016-04-25,thomasshahbaz,Embarrassingly terrible,6,"with the exception of the first episode (due to terrible cgi blue, eyed monsters), i found the first series of this show quite gripping, with tense drama and witty dialogue. the problem now is that it's more and more (and more) of the same, so what once seemed fresh and interesting seems hackneyed and boring. personally, the cgi always brings me out of the story, and the whole dragon-based/supernatural side of things, along with such scenes as the woodenly-acted red woman queefing a ghost out of her foofoo, just make me roll my eyes. if you like ridiculous cgi fantasy, clearly this will appeal. now, at season 6, we have hardly any of the wit and surprise of the earlier seasons, instead being left with lots of swearing, delivered by actors who don't seem like they can really be bothered any more. the scenes (now manifold) in faux-foreign tongues are embarrassing (perhaps this is a bit too subjective coming from me, as i am a linguist); in fact the whole thing is quite embarrassingly bad now.i also had a realisation whilst watching s06e01, that this is basically star trek (not a good thing).actors now spend a lot of time stating literally what is happening or has just happened (""i did what i thought was right, and i got murdered for it, and now i'm back""...""he stabbed him in the back""...)."
2015-11-08,bnevs18,Great on the surface...ran into the ground,10,"this show is extremely well produced, which is something that i appreciate...the setting and major plot lines are also quite excellent. the problem lies in the direction these great things have been taken. let me first say that i have not read the books...so if you want to argue ""it was in the books!""; well, then my criticisms to come are of the books too. a) while it has slowed down somewhat in season 5, the gratuitous nudity and violence is wholly unnecessary. in most cases, it is necessary to convey the brutality of the universe, however, a lot of times its done as a cheap way to shock the viewer. did we really need that last scene of lady stark being gored on screen? a cut to black and slicing sound would have been fine, but they seem to want to spit on the good work they have done. and did we really need 8 minutes of the queen regent walking naked? b) there are many great characters...and while i don't like ""good always triumphs"", four of the five characters i have really been interested have died (tyrion being the lone holdout). a lot of them dying just for the sake of shocking the viewer. c) the plots are divergent and mostly interesting, but to get invested in any of them leads straight to them getting slaughtered."
2019-08-29,mrinalmmehta,My Review,8,"a world without looking forward for a game of thrones season, not sure how that is going to be. certainly one of the best entertainers and for a very very long time. i haven't read the books and there are many who would say that books are better and maybe they are. but this was a good tv series. if you haven't watched it yet, do watch it. it's gripping. :)peace out!"
2019-05-20,boardy-55103,"Dear GoT, I'm leaving you",8,"dear game of thrones, i think we should start seeing other people, it's not you it's me, i'm taking the dog cuz i don't think you'll be able to care for him. maybe in the future we can be friends, but i doubt it. i want your cheater always a cheater and you cheated on me. i'll go back to the books they were always better to me than you were anyways. no hard feelings. take care of yourself."
2021-07-04,sovernix,A story that has been followed all over the world!,6,"for the first time, i watched the first season from beginning to end. at a time when the st. petersburg deputy milonov declares the inadmissibility of showing this series in russia... and what made him so hooked? the life and relationships of people who are inferior in their depravity to today's realities? in my opinion, milonov, who is carried away, is not engaged in his own business.the film did not leave me indifferent. but it was possible to make it more interesting by bringing more dynamics. and there are too few positive heroes against the background of the ubiquitous treachery and betrayal. so the only symbol of light for me was undoubtedly brandon stark."
2019-07-25,brummieman,Late starter,2,"i had never watched an episode until the beginning of july this year 2019, i have just finished the entire 8 series. a total wow of a series. i was neither here nor there for the first 7 episodes of season 1, it was good but could have easily walked away, however by episodes 8, 9, 10 i was truly hooked good and proper. the cliff hangers are the best and guarantee you will be tuning into ever episode. the stark family are close knit and live in a loyal community, into this community steps a king, his wife and her brother, this change everything, the king requests dad (the loyal ned stark) return to be his right hand man thus begins an epic journey of betrayal murder and mayhem and an absolute need inside each viewer to see justice done on behalf of the innocent. but will justice be found? sit tight, be anxious, be happy, be in awe, be shocked, be bewildered, be appalled and be gob smacked, this is a roller coaster of emotions where even myths come to live with outstanding special effects and each actor/ress deserves an oscar"
2019-05-27,pnathan28,Amazing,7,"as a huge fan of fantasy and scifi, i was amazed that we actually got to see something of this quality on tv. i thought that lord of the rings had set the bar for fantasy action but got tops that easily and has set a really high bar. as good as the action is, the story and the characters are the real draw here and i will always remember this show fondly and hope we can get more shows of this quality where so much care and detail went into making it."
2019-06-13,comradwinston,A Show Like Few Others (until seasons 7&8),10,"grounded in consequences, this show is second to none. characters do things for reasons, what motivates them and so on. they don't eagerly cling to a rail and serve as slaves to a plot. it's all very natural and seemingly chaotic but every action inspires its host of reactions, this show respects that truth like few others. heroes die and villains succeed. every catastrophe is earned as much as any triumph.it also respects the little things in life. the image of the world it portrays isn't tortuously cynical but it isn't flowery either. life is a mess of many actors bobbing back and forth in the tide. we all struggle for a place and they do no less and rarely with malice. everything happens for a reason and that can be as simple as hungering for a bit of chicken.this all was true until season seven, when the show,runners ran out of material to copy to the screen. then all the actors in the grand play of game of thrones became slaves to the plot. it became the very thing that it was celebrated to not be."
2019-05-20,dibyayan_chakravorty,"Ignore The Final Season, And The Show Is Great",10,"everyone got everything what they wanted from season 1 in the end. finally, the series finale is little more satisfactory than other episodes of the final season. expected a better ending, of course. but, the show was already ruined in the last 5 episodes and so a perfectly grand ending was not possible. david benioff and d.b. weiss took the responsibility to direct the final episode and did well. at least fans are getting a happy ending."
2019-06-03,snigbhaumik,What will I do with those GoT accessories and apparels?,10,"since years i was proudly wearing those ""winter is coming"" tees, ""the fire & the dragon"" tees. my name was stark. very often i took pride to declare ""that's what i do. i drink and i know things"". saying ""valar morghules"" pumped bloods in my heart. sometimes imagined myself as ""the girl with no names"". was fascinated by hearing ""all men must die"". my car key holder still says ""mother of dragon"".now after season 8 it feels a shame to wear those tees. the pride of being a fan of the greatest tv series is gone.dear d&d, would you be kind enough to buy those stuff back from me? it will be painful to throw those away, at the same time cannot wear those as well. will give you hell lot of discount!at least a public apology to all those fans like myself is warranted. we do not deserve this at all.dear hbo, aren't you considering dropping d&d entirely and remaking the season 8 again? why not? don't let the tv historians later say ""there was a great popular show named game of thrones, and in the so,called final season its writers and directors just went mad, ruined the show entirely and murdered its characters as well as its fans""."
2014-03-30,dragoonkain,Incredible show ... a little to fast paced though,10,"i had heard about george r.r. martin's a song of ice and fire book series for years but never got around to reading it. when they announced the hbo show i was excited because i had a lot of friends who read the books.but when i actually started watching the show, i actually found it frustrating to watch. there were too many characters with too much backstory that seemed to go unexplained. i felt like the show was moving at a breakneck pace and wasn't catering to the non,book readers at all. by the end of the fourth episode, i gave up. it was too confusing. i couldn't keep track of it all and i felt like the show was moving too fast.sometime later, a friend urged me to give it another chance. he lent me the blu-ray of season one and told me to watch the special features that went into the background of the show. after watching that, it clicked with me. i re-watched the first four episodes and loved them a lot more. after that i was hooked. i quickly got caught up with the series and found myself eagerly awaiting season 3.i started reading the books around that time and only just recently finished book 5. i have to say that the books are even better than the show! while the show is great for its fast paced plot, great acting and stunning visuals, the books take a little more time to flesh out the characters, go into the backstory, and spend a little more time with exposition.the main problem i have with the show is that it's too fast paced. you have to really pay close attention because if you miss one line of dialog, it's easy to get lost. this was why i gave up when i initially watched it. the show would benefit from the use of flashbacks and a longer season (13 episodes seems perfect). or maybe just take a bit more time for character dialog to allow for more exposition. i know some people might complain that there's ""too much talking"" already, but i'm not one of those people who needs action all the time in my shows and movies.that being said, once you understand what's going on, the show is excellent and highly addictive. it's the best ongoing show on television right now. definitely watch it, and if you get lost, take a break, watch some of the history of westeros featurettes from the blu-ray (also on youtube) and try again. it's definitely worth it."
2019-05-21,ssra_25,An amazing show...up until the end of Seasons 6. After that you'd better stop watching,9,"the acting is excellent, from pretty much every single actor. the writing is excellent, at least up until season 7. the character build,up is also great, at least up until season 7.then it all slowly goes downhill, until it reaches the bottom of the abyss in season 8.seriously, if you haven't watched the show yet and if you don't wanna end up with a bad taste in your mouth than do not watch season 7 and most especially 8. watch until the end of season 6, then wait for the books.short characterization of seasons:season 1 - excellent season 2 - excellent
season 3 - excellent
season 4 - excellent
season 5 - excellent
season 6 - ok...ish
season 7 - mediocre (at most)
season 8 - a complete disaster"
2016-08-10,mynameisroman,One of the Best Shows ever,10,"i loved the show from the very first episode and i could not stop. after 24 hours i have seen the first season and wanted more. too bad i had to wait a couple of months until season 2 was out. but what happened then was strange. i totally forgot about the show until shortly before the start of season 6. because of that i rewatched season 1 and then continued with season 2 , 5 in less than a week before season 6 started. i was shocked why i waited so long to continue watching it. the characters are interesting, the storyline always surprises you, the list of the great things is endless. the show is very well written and the cast is perfectly chosen. there are characters you immediately love and some you immediately hate. at the beginning its very clear who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. but over a couple of seasons this is getting more and more mixed up since everyone has their own agenda and like in real life no one is really only good or only evil and the actions of the characters are often unpredictable. whats also interesting about this show is that with season 1 it starts incredibly high in terms of quality and storytelling and it stays this way until today. this is quite rare. most shows either improve or decline after a couple of seasons but this one stays always on top which is a very hard thing to pull off, although season 6 might have taken a couple of shortcuts here and there. a realistic rating would be something like 9.3 to 9.5."
2015-01-05,liamcullen6,Simply the BEST,8,"where do i even begin? game of thrones is simply brilliant.there is only one other television series which has managed to get me so emotionally involved, but i will not name it, for doing so would draw the focus away from this masterpiece. game of thrones sends you to bed at night fearing for the life of your favourite character; you just don't know if next week's episode will be their last.the writing is superb. i cannot stress enough how clever the writers are. it is a rare thing for someone like me to sit back and smile at so many of the bold, powerful and often double,edged one-liners the characters have. here are a few examples:""when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.""""if you thought this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""""a day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid.""""dracarys!""i get so excited just reciting some of those quotes in my head! do you see what this series does to you?! those one-liners are so powerful - and the best part is that they're all-throughout the series! those lines alone are capable of exciting me beyond belief for the next season.the characters are also phenomenal. take varys and littlefinger for example: two unbelievably complicated, sharp, and quick-witted characters which when put together make for some truly marvellous dialogue. dialogue? yes! dialogue! they make otherwise trivial conversation oh-so-interesting because their words always carry many meanings. or perhaps cersei and joffrey: how is it even possible for one to loathe them both so much yet love them at the same time? i don't know, but i love/hate them so much!the setting deserves a review on its own! breathtaking! you truly do feel immersed in westeros when you watch game of thrones. oh and can we just take a minute to worship george r.r. martin? thanks. i'm petrified of what that evil man will do in season five but at the same time i can't wait. oh, and another reason this show is brilliant: dragons. and daenerys. oh i could go on for days about daenerys...hodor!this show has everything you could possibly hope for: there is never a dip in quality - the show achieves a high-quality consistency throughout; the characters and cast are absolutely incredible; the plot is ever-so-complicated and ingenious with many different layers and sub-plots; the setting and cinematography are utterly fantastic; the show never loses pace or interest; and you are emotionally engaged.in a nutshell, if you haven't seen game of thrones, then you need to. but be warned: your emotions will be toyed with, your heart torn in two, and on the day that you are finally happy, ""your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" oh, also, if you dislike nudity, gore, being upset, not-so-happy endings, or quality television and you'd rather watch people cook meth...look elsewhere.winter is coming!"
2019-01-07,dlracer2,The hype can never match the experience,9,"shakespeare could have never written such a complex, immersive, masterpiece. there have been lulls here and there but every action and subplot seems to have the most brilliant intertwined purpose. the actors give every character such life that it becomes part of your day to day being. as the intricate web of destiny becomes unwound to its final conclusion, you wonder if game of thrones will find its final chapter in a movie theater. the story couldn't be more rich and deserving than to eventually become the biggest movie in cinema history"
2014-07-20,the_other_snowman,The Art of the Cliffhanger,10,"having read all the books, i suppose it's only natural that i should be completely bored of the tv series. but knowing what happens next hasn't stopped me enjoying and revisiting other books, movies, and shows ,- in fact i've got a small shelf full of them. perhaps the trouble with ""game of thrones"" is that it offers so few pleasures besides finding out ""what happens next"".the cast is generally very good, and they make the material sound better than it really is. the dialogue is weighed down with clumsy expository speeches -- at least one per episode, usually more -- with which each actor has to wrestle. peter dinklage, as the dwarf tyrion, stands out as a sympathetic, if self-centered, antihero, and he manages to command the screen even when his lines are stilted, clunky rubbish. sean bean, before losing his head, delivered a typically charismatic and soulful performance as the tragic hero ned stark, but even he struggled with the exposition. the many child actors, maisie williams especially, are more believable, maybe because children aren't normally saddled with huge chunks of expo-speak. much of the rest of the cast have endeavored to create performances so subtle they end up almost wooden, while a few others engage in dodgy accents and some arch scenery-chewing. (aiden gillen, as the scheming littlefinger, gets less comprehensible with each passing season).the show is heavy on plot, with seemingly several dozen characters all competing for your attention while they vie for the throne of the seven kingdoms, or just try to out-maneuver and kill each other off. there's so much plot that there's hardly any room for style, and the show is filmed in a rather dull, stagy fashion: the average scene involves two characters sitting in a room or walking through the woods and trading info-dumps or arguing with each other, and periodically someone will get stabbed. the reliance on dialogue means you don't actually have to watch the show: instead you can just listen to it without missing much, except the gore and nudity.and while there's nothing wrong with a little harmless gratuitous nudity, ""game of thrones"" pours it on with a trashy prurience befitting a sexually precocious 12-year-old boy, rather than an adult of either gender. the male gaze entirely dominates these scenes, apparently designed to appeal to fans of soft-core pornography who want a little high drama with their smut. their gratuity can be gauged by the fact that the naked women are usually uncredited extras, and very few of the main cast -- male or female -- appear in these scenes. the gore and violence are equally trashy, with squirting arteries and squishy sound effects, to the point that they become more laughably ridiculous than genuinely painful.so what happens next? that's really the only thing keeping this show going, as every episode and nearly every individual scene ends with a cliffhanger to keep you coming back for more. characters are captured, betrayed, condemned to death, beheaded, or left for dead on a regular basis. ned, robb, and catelyn stark have all passed on, as have tywin lannister and his sadistic grandson joffrey; the fun now will be seeing who gets bumped off next. but if you've read the books, or if you have any interest in watching ""game of thrones"" a second time, the question ""what happens next?"" isn't going to appeal to you. even if you just want to watch a good story that's told well, you're going to have an uphill battle with ""game of thrones""."
2019-08-18,swalesfilm,Confused by appeal,1,"i am struggling to get through first season dvd set, with some episodes i have replayed as i thought i might have missed something due to the lack of plot and story. i am confused how so many people stayed with it. boring indeed,"
2019-05-15,behnam-a,A very well structered one until the halfway,6,"i have been watching this since the very beginning of it. it has started amazingly and was very well paced and produced. a whole big amazing real but fantasy world with interesting characters all have different story lines and still connected masterfully.i have to admit that i was amazed and found myself unable to stop watching it. i wen through and were looking for any material related to it so i found the books. a song of ice and fire. what a great universe. what a magnificent writing and what a brutal yet interesting story telling. i found myself dedicated to the story and faster than any book before, i have done reading them. then again and again i re,watched the show and tried to dig down the theories, prophecies, build ups and characters arcs. what a great journey! i have to admit that it was great. reading about the blue rose in the wall and finding the true meaning beyond the ice and fire was especially a magnificent experience. thanks a lot both for the creator of the show and the author george raymond richard martin.that was the first part, until the books stopped because for any reason the author didn't finished them and the end of season 4 on the tv and some parts of the rest until the end of season 6. beyond that, the show has started to fall down and got worse and worse through time. no complex story line links, no character development, no mind-blowing twists, no deep dialogues and finally it converted to a whole new thing. something that was not like what i have loved once. it became a disaster in season 8 in fact. what an unfortunate, what a waste.i gave the show 10/10 stars and despite some bad writings and bad episodes haven't had a second thought about changing it ever before until now. it is with great sorrow only now where i am going to change my vote for the whole tv show and give it a fair one considering season 7 and season 8. and considering that, it is definitely way lower than a 10/10. this is a beater end for me and game of thrones. i wont watch it again because it is both ridiculous and painful (for example anytime someone says ""winter is coming"") and i wont be reading the books neither because ive been informed that author has been saying :the shows path is not much difference from the books"". also i wont be watching anything relating to this universe ever unless i hear otherwise about the way the books will handle the story.so if you haven't watched this show yet, be careful to not get involved very deep and not be deceived by the greatness of first 4 chapters or you will be disappointed in the most horrible way possible."
2011-10-13,aminjacoub,Movie show,10,"game of thrones can't be qualified as a typical tv show. it can be easy defined as an exceptional work made for tv. hbo once again showed us how tv show can be made like the best in movie world. after sopranos and with boardwalk empire they gave us real pleasure and enjoyment in front of tv screens that don't look like tv show, but rather quality long running movies.i did not read a book that series are based on, but as a freshmen to the theme i can only express true pleasure with this tv show.the plot breeds in tradition of any medieval fantasy story, reminds me partly on lord of the rings with old classic movies scent, like it is ivanhoe or robin hood for example. also the smell of merlin and boorman's excalibur are strong here.from cinematography to direction, everything is a first class, and actors are wonderful. sean bean is at his best here unlike some movies where he lacks his true potential.i am kind of impatient to see next season, but i am sure it will be pure pleasure. i can tell you this, after watching such a show and other i mentioned here, you will never again watch at so many tv commercial crap that exist today."
2019-06-10,jeandemichaque,Shame!,3,"well, i had to come back to this to change my rating from 10 to 8. the last season was too disappointing to not do it. everything about it was wrong. the most epic series of all time was meant to have a soap,operalike final season."
2015-07-07,alexanderextazy,Addictive and rewarding for your time,7,"i liked this show from the first season; despite some fantasies involved.but the director knew exactly how to attract fantasy haters, so the production of this show took a lot of good money & time on making it well worth the viewer's time.the build up of the series is incredible.. even until current season, it only seems as if the show has started and it has a lot more to go through.my expectation is that this show will last very long (who knows, maybe even longer than bold & the beautiful).one little detail i didn't like is the redhair lord of light servant.. now we all know this is a medieval/ancient fictional setting.. but even in other planets.. fake lips don't exist except in planet earth in the dumb century of 21.this detail had me avoid eating lunch/dinner while watching since it's quite disgusting for me to look at cosmetic surgery humans.. apart from that, i'm still puzzled at how most of the world are in love with hairy girl emilia clarke.. in a nutshell she is an average looking women who is definitely a skank without makeup.. and just a look at her mammal hands can make a man lose appetite.. so i give this advice to all you horny males out there: not all that moans is hot."
2019-05-21,dholliday-imdb,Seasons 1-6: outstanding. 7: daft but good. 8: disappointing,10,"let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched got yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. what's the consensus? in this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:seasons 1,6: outstanding. deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. got is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. there are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. but at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. the writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. if you ever enjoyed lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.the biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. we lost our suspension of disbelief. fatal for fiction. it also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.so can i recommend a got marathon for newcomers? yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. but best series of all time it is not. it could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:battlestar galactica (2003-2008)twin peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)breaking bad"
2019-02-09,craigdales,Not my cuppa tea.,3,"really good acting, the story line is ok! but....... it's very slow it gets really boring it as unrealistic scenes i get confused which party to support so i went for the starks i hope they come on top and wipe that little twit of a king smile off his face. haha, i just get bored i couldn't watch got week by week i wouldn't get past season one i'm on season 4 so i'm hoping it gets better fingers crossed. so hopefully season 7 finale as the biggest baddest battle scene ever oh yeh i hope one of the dragons eats the mother of dragons. so yeh that's just my opinion which i'm intitled too fingers crossed for up coming battles because i'm on season 4 an in the first three seasons i've not really seen out good just boring dialogue apart from the odd killing of three sparks and alot of nudity but i do feel really uncomfortable watching the same sex scenes i'm not saying it shouldn't be on there because it's for everyone i'm just saying i feel uncomfortable anyhow goodluck!!!"
2019-05-22,darklydreamingrahu,Game of Thrones is Over....,9,"well, it's over. this review is spoiler,free.i spent almost a decade with game of thrones. i have seen the first few seasons 5 or 6 times.if you are the type of viewer that enjoys the ride, and you don't really care where it is taking you, then game of thrones is a10/10.it has some of the best production quality, acting, and cinematography not just on the small screen, but in all of cinema.however, it does not stick the landing.seasons 7 and 8 are very rushed and poorly written resulting in a whimpering finale that leaves dozens of plot holes unfilled while also leaving a dry, poor taste in your mouth.i'm not exaggerating. dozens of plots are simply forgotten. the most interesting things in the show mean nothing at all. the intrigue goes nowhere. you can ignore at least 75% of the interesting lore and characters, since they mean absolutely nothing.but, it looks amazing, which is why it gets a 6.also, if you are a student of acting, all of the actors and actresses are really spot-on, and the sound and music are unparalleled.overall, game of thrones is a massive disappointment. it will go down as one of the most controversial and divisive series of all time. its last two seasons are incomprehensibly rushed, and those seasons betray almost every theme and plot that the books spent decades refining.even after all that, it is quite a journey getting there. if that's what interests you, then i cautiously recommend game of thrones with a warning that it has very little payoff."
2013-03-02,dndcullens,Oh dear!,9,"so you get friends coming to you to say ""you gotta watch got, it's amazing!"" and not being a tv watcher you ignore them. so you see the series on offer on dvd and you mention it to the wife and low and behold you get it as a present. so you watch it and hope that it is going to be something special. and low and behold you ring up your mates after watching a number of episodes and say ""wft is this shyte?"" and then you remember these same ""mates"" were lollygagging about ""dexter"" (which is possibly the worst mistake i have ever made when buying dvd's recommended by ""mates"". but back to got. it is not just that it is going nowhere but, like, dexter, is it quickly running out of ideas. so far, some kid was murdered by a brother and sister but he doesn't die and wakes up not remember anything. or does he? or who cares? and then there is the nudity and sex. right, it is hbo, and there is nothing wrong with a bit of nudity and sex, but jaysus, we have watched a few episodes now and the sex business is just there for no reason. no ""plot"" advancement. no explanation of character. nothing. just sex. alright there is an incest scene but interestingly not graphic and this is the whole premise of the story. as i said we are about 6 or 7 episodes into this shyte, but the story is thin and as of yet we have not had the obligatory lesbian scene (hbo trademark, come to that every network trademark). something to look forward to i suppose as there is feck all else. the 2/10 rating is for the character of the midget brother and sean bean. this rises it slightly above awful. and for those who will say watch the whole series and then comment i say do i have to? really, do i have to?"
2021-01-23,abhibnlcs,Season 8 ruined the show!!,10,"this was a top notch show until season 6. season 7 was average but season 8 just downright ruined it for all got fans. who the hell wrote the death of night king? that was such a ridiculous scene that i couldn't believe they approved and filmed it. all in all, it's still a great show to watch but the ending, it left such a bitter taste that even the stars of the show feel it was disappointing."
2012-06-22,strider_1978,Truly remarkable,1,"someone cared...this series is an onion, the layers peel away with each viewing. i am fortunate to have viewed the blu,ray version. what a treat i had. i won't go into technical detail, i 'will' attempt to convey some thoughts and feelings on this remarkable piece of television. a game of thrones is not best described as 'epic'. it will not entertain those looking for another lord of the rings. being of the tv variety, 'thrones' does not thrill with wide screen scenery. the camera is closer, yet not too close to be unmindful of the need to 'sell' the rich setting that is westeros. for those who like myself, are enamored of the characters, and who caught our own hearts in our mouths at various stages of the novel- 'thrones' excels. judicious is the trimming, yet clever and thoughtful are the presented scenes. the characters are given their literary dimensions, and in some cases, namely minor characters- much more so. thus we can forgive when certain scenes and well remembered slices of dialog are handled somewhat differently in order to portray a living vision, and version of literary events. my personal indulgence is in *details*. details are *everything* in the geek world. thus there are pleasant surprises in store for those prepared to sacrifice epic for clever writing and budget handling. there is a particular scene i will not spoil. but one that the knowing will acknowledge. it reads roughly-'jaime's sword was ripped from its sheathe.'- that particular segment was handled a little differently, yet that tiny detail was not neglected :) for the affiliated a greater majority of the characters can be seen and named. most deliver solid to outstanding performances, some are only realised towards the end of the series. in the novel my favourite is tyrion lanniser, in the tv series i'll say that although tyrion is indeed brilliantly portrayed, stands outs include 'arya', 'robert baratheon' and cat's sister 'lysa'. these actors i feel really projected their talent. if i am to be objective and critical i would say that in my personal opinion the weakest link is catelyn stark. the performance is good, but at times i was a little unconvinced, as though i could see the effort, but i was not completely sold. sean bean does 'eddard' proud, i just have to switch off a little to see him has a lord of the north when he opens his mouth, the lines spoken in his native dialect. at times i had to suspend disbelief when father spoke to daughters, who spoke as high born princesses without that distinct northern tongue. regarding the nudity. 'thrones' is, as i believe i stated above a very clever accomplishment. it lives and breathes with honesty. there is nudity, and sex aplenty. it should not however be considered pornography. these were times without the luxury of technology, where serf and lord alike took pleasures of the flesh. within every scene there is character growth and rounding, regardless of the content or activity. george r r martin did not shy away from 'whoring' and partnered sex- neither did the makers of 'thrones' :) looking forward to season 2."

2020-09-30,robin_singh211221,GOT Is Tremendous Show Forever.,1,"before watching this show. everyone talk to me this show is r,rated lot of nudes scences, s*x scenes, adult stuffs & brutally scenes. but this is the thing. forces me too much to watch this show or make the excitement feel. but when i start watching this show. next episode after 1 episode and continue. then i understand that there is a misconception in the minds of people about this show that there is so much to see besides all these things. such as story, screenplay, great dialogues, great performance, character writing and much more to see. in my opinion, this show is the best made show so far, which i think is impossible to recreate this show at this level. and this show is my all time favourite show. as long as i am alive the characters of this show will be remembered all the time and never forgettable dialogues.
story is brilliantly written, every season screenplay is lit🔥🔥, direction, vfx, graphics & all actors and actresses performance brilliantly done. everything this show is brilliantly done. except season 8 because season 8 totally disappointed, no doubt.
my personal rating every season wise
got s01-s07: 10/10
got season 08 : 6/10"
2015-07-23,duvernetphotography,Everything you could ask for,4,"this is unquestionably the best series i've seen in ages. great acting, great lines, amazing sets, constant twists, well developed characters, nudity and more nudity, sex of course, zombies (who doesn't like zombies) passion, terror, horror, suspense and more. if you rolled a bit of every medieval ruler into a few characters with spice from genghis khan or ivan the terrible you'd have some idea of the breadth of the characters there are some very clever interchanges between the characters and genuine lessons in power and ruling. you could pick up excerpts of history from just about any period. the real challenge this series now faces, into its 6th season, is not to get carried away of over,the-top drama. keep the mill of intrigue, revenge and compassion going without relying on the zombies to be center stage. the walking dead this is so been-there-done-that. bring on a new challenge. love the giants though. i'm also a sucker for read hair. why does everyone south of the wall have to speak in a pseudo british accent? the exotica from morocco is also a great contrast to the ice north of the wall. keep 'em coming!"
2020-06-11,ibibrov,"Flawless Early seasons, flawed but incredibly paid-off later seasons, disastrous last seasons",10,"game of thrones. one of the biggest pop culture icons of all time. there probably isn't one human being who hasn't at least heard of it at some point. and for good reason. the first 4 seasons of game of thrones are flawless, beautiful compositions of jaw dropping cinematography, goosebump inducing music score, and masterful actors. the writing is truly great, with virtually every scene impacting the viewer in some way. the characters are beautifully established, with realistic and nuanced arcs. realism is baked into this world, making westeros uncomfortably familiar, and the murky, depressing, dark themes and plot lines only enhancing that effect. then come the later seasons, 5, and 6. the writing is starting to show cracks, with characters changing without any real initiative, a lot of consequences and story lines diluted. however, these seasons, especially season 6, still have some of the best moments ever made for television, with characters to show for it. the battle of the bastards for example, is absolutely jaw dropping. and then the later seasons, which butcher pretty much everything and everyone. the female characters were mostly very unlikable to me, such as arya, or danerys, who really doesn't deserve the throne, but whatever. (osha was awesome tho.) but characters like jon snow, ned stark, jaime and tyrion lannister, shall forever be remembered. in the end, game of thrones shall never be forgotten, and i will always have a place in my heart for it, but i just can't forgive what they did to it. i'm just gonna wait for the books now. 9/10"

Filth.,5,"after so much discussion and acclaim about this show, i obviously had to check it out. turns out it's horrible. i can stomach violence, vulgarity, and mistreatment of people when it makes sense for a show. but this show is just reveling in human misery without any meaning. it makes light of abuse and torture without any grace. this will not age well, because as humans evolve it will be hard to defend this kind of garbage or pretend it has depth."
2019-05-21,searchersd,What a ridiculously pathetic ending.,9,"very sad that such a tremendous series has ended in such an illogical, unenjoyable, lackluster way. what a let down for the fans who have been avidly following this show for so many years. i'm still shaking my head in disbelief."
2015-06-18,vav-61764,Season 5: Another Heart-Stopping Season,10,"as game of thrones's season 5 comes to an end. again, hbo proves and demonstrate its power towards creating a very solid tv series presented in ten episodes. a characteristic of really stands out is the well,done job of the technical aspects, such as the characters's makeup, costumes and the places chosen where the show would be filmed. this season surely is based in the books, but as continues to demonstrate, some stories of the tv show have differences from the books. one particular feature of this season is finally reaches every storyline of the books, except the ones which weren't presented in the series, and even showing some unpublished events. since the tv series reached the books, bran's core is left aside to be showed in the next season. the main cores of this season is daenerys, tyrion, jon snow, jaime, cersei, arya, sansa and stannis.the early episodes have a slow paced. there're a lot of conversation that allows a greater development of characters and the stories, which the show has proved already that it knows how to develop the depths of the characters. in the first seven episodes, violent scenes, fight scenes did happen, but surely the highlights of this season happen in the late three episodes.sansa's core starts very promising showing the change of nature of sansa, becoming a stronger woman, unfortunately something horrendous happens to her, breaking her up. the scene where this happens is probably one of the hardest scenes in the entirely series to watch. arya's core is increasingly attractive and intriguing, due to her story with the faceless men. in jon snow's storyline occurs the biggest and coolest fight scene, showing that what everyone should worry about is the white walkers.a most awaited meeting happen when daenerys and tyrion are put in the same room. a scene which has to be highlighted is the passage of tyrion and jorah through valyria, it had such a mystic air. making in us a desire of get to know more about the past of this world. the dragons's scenes are improving regarding the cgi used, resulting in scenes each time more nail-biting.much of the cersei's scenes in the early episodes are talking regarding the rule of the realm, but with the rise of a religion in the citadel, some fear is caused by it and spreads across king's landing. at the end of the season, cersei is put in a horrible situation making her do something extremely hard and this scene is in the top-3 scenes of the season. jaime's core is the one which was really poorly developed. in it had a fight scene that was terrible, it looked so choreographed. another disappointment of this core was the creation and development of the sand snakes, they were so badly constructed in the tv showstannis's core has some interesting scenes, some showing his love towards his daughter, and another showing what he's willing to do to reach and achieve his goal."
2020-01-30,christiancarden,poor endings ruin it all,9,"the last couple seasons were boring and easy to tell the writers were liking for an exit. shock value doesn't make for good writing, in fact quite the opposite, got fails where twd failed. at least we have the witcher now to save us. hbo is long past it's prime, obviously from their new sci,fi ""comedy"". it s not tv... it's trash"
2020-05-23,anthonyvincentbruno,Superb,6,would have been 10 stars except for the mediocre last series. they should have used a screenwriter with imagination.
2021-09-26,pickle-92642,"One of the greatest shows of all time, even with the ending.",10,"no matter how much criticism it gets for its ending, writing, directing, you cannot deny that this is one of the singular greatest achievements in all of film history. absolutely riveting television. some of the grandest emotions can be felt by watching this series. i can't recall a time when watching this that i did not feel emotionally invested and/or connected. some of the most insane and awesome scenes i have ever seen in a piece of fiction. i cannot believe people think the entire show is ruined just because of like 2,3 bad episodes at the end. it's as if you're completely ignoring the sheer brilliance of season 1-6, and in my opinion, season 7 as well. this is currently my second favorite show, only under breaking bad. i urge anybody who likes film/tv to check this out, it will not disappoint."
2016-06-15,mitrapourmand,much ado about nothing,1,"like its inspiration material the lord of the rings the game of thrones is much ado about nothing .and here is why, where in lord of the rings the story relied upon magic, luck and eagles saving the day , the game of thrones in itself does not have a real story. characters are introduced in flooding way and all of them seem one dimensional , and here is why. take eddard stark for example, this man is head of an ancient family who have survived so many things , he must have inherited some political savvy eh ? no, he is stupid of course his idiocy is painted as honor. joffrey is pure evil there is no background for him he is just evil, cersei is evil, jamie is evil, balon gregory? evil , his children? evil, stark children either cruel and dumb like robb or just evil like arya, the one that is not evil is related to magic dany ? don't even want to start on that one she is evil , cruel and a hypocrite to the bone i can go on and on but why bother the truth to be told every one in this story is evil and more importantly dumb , like how can tywin lannister a shrewd and calculating politician make so many mistake and create so many enemies? the other thing that bothers me and makes this series unwatchable is the amount of sex and nudity , like how many times do have watch prostitutes of westeros ? how come women have show us their boobs five times in a minutes? what is so appealing about sexual deviance? for me the answer is non. and finally o come back to my starting point, the series ( books and tv series )have no story at all . try to picture it a lot of people have been killing each other and now most of them are dead , so what ? where is the point in that ? and the others or white walkers story is so dumb that can not be taken seriously it seems the writer of the books and the series as well couldn't come up with anything special as major turning event so he went on to right about dragons and ice zombies and people with silver hair and purple eyes and sex ."
2014-11-05,febru3012,"Castles, Knights, Jousts, Sword Duels etc whats to dislike?.......",1,"the realism is scary with the attention to detail in the sets and locations. its easy to see no money was spared in conveying a sense of the middle ages. some will be turned off by the male and female frontal nudity, cussing and not so authentic, supposedly middle ages script. in fact, in some scenes it seems you might be over hearing a conversation on the london tube or nyc subway, and i'm only slightly exaggerating. even with these drawbacks game of thrones is still a wonder to behold. i've just recently acquired, via loan, from my public library the seasons 1 & 2. for those of us of common lineage, unable to afford an hbo cable connection that is, its a smart way to play. even if one has to wait for these dvd discs to see them, its well worth the wait."
2018-09-26,neutralword,Copy,8,think this tv show and lord of the rings movies might finally get hollywood to realize you dont need to reinvent the wheel.  if you buy the rights to a famous fantasy book you should not change it you should aim to make as close a copy of that book in the medium of tv or movie. this show gives me hope for the future of fantasy tv shows
2018-12-31,nfire-29741,Love this series,3,very addictive. the storyline can be complicated and intricate. makes for a great series. cant wait of the last season!
2020-09-29,krazysoon,Game of Bordeom,10,i tried to like the show. made it to season 4 and just gave up. it's not a bad show but it's overhyped. glad it's finally over after hearing how much of a failure the last season was...

2019-05-20,tinyfordst,Remember to adjust your rating,1,"so the series is finally over, and the last few episodes absolutely destroyed the legacy. the show averaged a 9.5 since season 1 until the end of season 8, now i just hope people remember to change their ratings to reflect the fact that this show is not deserving of a 10.it couldn't maintain a perfect storyline like breaking bad did, and i believe we owe it to future generations to not mislead them into thinking this is the best show on tv when it started great, but finished horribly"

2021-09-22,cujorocky,Hated it.,8,"all it is, is chopping peoples heads off, cheating spouses, rape scenes, degrading actresses by making them show their naked bodies constantly, murder, betrayal, killing children and dogs. that's it. it's depressing and disgusting."
2017-10-20,antieliteantinatalist,Seems to have been inspired by the Biblical chronicles,10,"why must all the so,called fantasies happen in somewhere that resembles ancient or medieval europe? if that's claimed to be a fantasy world, the place in which it happens must be fantasy too. what's with all of those fake languages? why do they have to create some new languages when it comes to a fantasy world? is a fantasy world just a place with normal people who speak uncanny or not-yet-heard languages? is a constructed language even necessary when you have to put some subtitles there so that the audience knows what they are talking about?! reviving john snow was lame and the ed sheeran part was also a big disappointment."
2019-05-14,sarahelizabethparker,What happened???,10,"the only reason why i gave this a 10 was because of seasons 1,4. ah, good memories. everything after it just starts getting worse and worse. season 5 was boring, season 6 gets better, but then season 7 happened and oh god, season 8 happened.what happened to the true expanse of this show? in the first seasons we traveled all across westeros and essos, and now it seems like we're trapped in winterfell and king's landing. what is going on in dorne? or the vale? it's okay if nothing is going on, but could that be shown or explained?and by god, this show has so many inconsistencies. sometimes it takes the characters a whole season to travel from winterfell to king's landing and other times it'll happen between episodes. the logistics of the show (battles, white walkers, etc.) also make no sense and have no rhyme or reason.the character development issues is what hurts me the most, mostly because i had become so invested in the characters. sometimes predictability is good. if you meet a character struggling with being good or bad, then turning good is a good ending. predictable, but satisfying. if they turn bad, not so predictable, but not satisfying. this is the dilemma of game of thrones.i don't even know if i'd recommend the show because the last 4 seasons are so disappointing and a waste of time.tldr: the show was good and now it's bad."
2015-02-25,arminhage,A well polished soap opera!,8,"much was said about these series and there is a firm fan base who swallow whatever they feed them under the name of ""game of thrones"" so i bet this review would get some stiff resistance and dislike but the truth should be told. they call it a success! i don't know how to assess success for a tv show at the time of illegal torrent downloads. yes, it was very successful in luring more illegal downloads than any other show in history and i assume it happened because of the high price of hbo as premium cable channels and its exclusive and somehow restricted broadcast through very limited channels. forbidden fruit is always exiting even if its apple, a fruit which is anything but exiting in reality! game of thrones is a nice show, it sure has very good production, character development is brilliant as there are no heroes and there are almost no pure villains. that's what i like about it. it's not black and white, its grey! but the screenplay lack the thrust. episodes come and go and nothing really happens. it was like it from the very beginning, it never improved, just continued like a flat line. after watching couple of episodes, it downgraded to the level of well polished soap opera. i was on my laptop doing my work and it was on on tv. each 2,3 hours i had to raise my head t see whats going on, i liked to know what happens at the end but the way to the end was so boring that i decided to make it tolerable with multi tasking. show is well produced with the worst screenply, 5/10 for nice set up only!"
2019-05-22,rukstar69,One of the best shows ever but....,10,"seasons 1,4 from top to bottom are absolutely amazing. the writing the acting, everything. once they couldn't adapt the story form george r.r. martins books it started to turn a bit. season 5 and 6 definitely dropped of a bit and that's expected. i have a problem with the lazy story telling of season 7 and 8. they completely rushed them and pretty much gave us cliff notes to end this saga. all in all this was a great ride and series but it could have been done alot better...i understand a lot of fans are upset with the way it ended but that should not reflect how amazing this show has been. it's one of the best ever..if it had a strong ending i would have given it a hard 10."

2021-04-10,cstover-28468,A bad ending can ruin it all,1,"if you've somehow managed to avoid watching game of thrones up until now, then i'm sure you've at least heard about the infamous final season and how it ruined what was once a great show. others might say that the show started to fall off at around season 5. and this is because that's around the time the showrunners ran out of source material to adapt and had to start making up stuff on their own. my personal take: seasons 1,4 are absolutely amazing, some of the best television i've ever seen and i loved those seasons dearly. season 5 is where it started to fall a little flat, however, i still enjoyed seasons 5 and 6 for the most part and think they were at least somewhat in the realm of greatness that the previous seasons had been in. however, season 7 and of course, season 8 are where things really started to fall apart. it went from being a show that didn't have ""plot armor"", meaning any character could die at any moment no matter how popular with fans they were, to pretty much every main character getting in situations where they absolutely should not survive but always manage to get saved at the last moment. it went from having great dialogue to them just making lame genital jokes and dwarf jokes. not to mention that it completely backtracked and ruined pretty much ever character's arc that had been building up to that moment, especially jaime. i'll never forgive them for what they did to jaime's character. and a bad ending can really hurt the rest of the show as well, because now i don't even wanna go back and watch the good seasons because i know how it ends and it ends horribly. so, if you've never watched the show, i honestly recommend you don't even bother. you'll just end up angry and disappointed with the ending and feel like all that time you spent getting invested in these characters was all for nothing."

2019-05-16,southeastuk,"""Art"" this aint! Predictable, bad writing, bad story, mostly terrible acting. Very low brow and a new low in Hollywood tat!",3,"i was practically forced , almost at gunpoint it feels - by acquaintances (note: not friends; none of my friends watch game of thrones!) to watch a few episodes of this. i wish i hadn't.the story is predictable, the acting mostly terrible (with notable exception of sean bean and the actors who play ned starks wife - sorry, couldn't be bothered to memorise their names!) and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.the violence is gratuitous, the sex and nudity - again - gratuitous and it is clear the shows writers and director went for shock value in most cases; to say it smacks of desperation would be an understatement.this really has set a new low for hollywood tat and i resent both the time i spent watching the few episodes that i did and the time i have spent listening to quivering geeks give me a blow by blow account of what has happened in the latest instalment.i watch very little television - roughly 20 mins in the last 3 months for example - and so when i do watch something, i'd like it to have just a little quality and be engaging enough without resorting to shock tactics, tacky actors or plunging new moral depths just for the sake of viewing figures. ""art"" this aint."
2019-08-20,dirtphelia,"Slooooow, so sloooow, and boring soap opera",1,"you know a show is going to be bad when the gratuitous nudity is rushed in. so many people seem to like this show, though, that i watched a few episodes (fast forwarded through the many, many stupid and pointless fight scenes) and thought that it probably got better at some point but it does not.it is just bad, bad, bad.this show seems to have been created as a way for dweebs to see naked women without leaving a history of porn in their browsers. just like some men ""read"" playboy for the articles, people must watch this show for the story. it's a very, very slow and boring show with breasts and shaved privates on display between heads being chopped off. yaaaawwwwnnnn."
2019-06-18,mvrk,An excellent show ruined by the last two episodes.,10,"no, i don't think game of thrones should've won the best drama emmy award. the award was for this year and this year alone. it wasn't for all 8 seasons. the last two episodes of the series ruined this whole show which cost around $50 million per year to make. it wasn't the bad writing or directing. it was the way they turned the show like a crazy ivan. they just wanted to give us an ending which we didn't see coming, just to make themselves feel superior and self,congratulating themselves. so no, the twist ending was not good. the traditional ending would've been much much better because the whole series was excellent up to that point. the traditional ending being danny and jon getting the throne. there was nothing wrong with that. so they had done a good job for all the seasons and each season did have its surprises, but the stupid ending surprise should not have happened. it ruined 9 years of excellency. to see dxd healthy and neat was all the more frustrating. i thought they would be too embarrassed to show their face in public for at least a year. it seems that they have surrounded themselves with people who worship them and are in denial. they are congratulating themselves believing they are the best because they are in their own little world. the worst is this show will be nominated again for the golden globes!! not looking forward to that."

2014-05-13,kuashie,This is more like it,10,"this is one of the shows that starts slowly, since it has a very broad story, to later on become a very epic show. there is nudity in the show, there are also a lot of vices but i am okay with it. if you don't like such things just stay away from this show. i would not recommend such a thing because that is not the focal point of this show and its positives far out ways the negatives to you, moreover from what i have gathered from reading the reviews on this site is that such things are original of what is in the books so there you go. i do not normally rate shows that high but this one is worth it and have earned it. the story is unpredictable, the acting is top notch and overwhelming. if you are now about to watch from season one i would ask you to give it time to develop and you would be rewarded later."

Then nose dives consciously and outrageously into oblivion.,8,"i have given game of thrones a score of six which is a reflection of how i view the series as a whole, after being considered in two parts. the show was excellent in the beginning 2 to 3 seasons while the directors had abundent source material to draw from. while the show became very poor once it had little or no source material left to draw from. these directors are obviously aren't good story tellers. so bare that in mind, investing in this show will lead to eventual disappointment.the story in the beginning is split into three overall aspects in the beginning, clear and well defined and each has very different feel. first is the dark, omimous and mysterious threat from beyond the great wall of ice that guards the northern lands. it's the first point of the show that is touched upon and it's deep threat and mystry are made clear even if the threat is still far away in the beginning.second we have complex intrigue of westeros and the various warring factions going after the iron throne. this is where author of the book does his best work and its portrayed on the screen very well. there is the north vs the casterly rock, iron islands vs kings landings (casterly rock) and the civil war of the north. much more inbetween happens also. the books are much more detailed so a lot of side stories are condensed or left out of the main story completely.the third part of the initial story is on esteros where daneryes and her brother begin a journey with the hope of returning triumphantly to westeros with a strong unstoppable army to reclaim the thrown for her family and for the people. again in the beginning many parts of this story are told very well because there is great source material.the acting was amazing, the stories were great, the potential unlimited. so where and why did it all go wrong for game of thrones? there are many theories as to why the show began to suck. but the consensus is, that the show creators just got bored of the project and wanted to go off to bigger and better things (perhaps a star wars gig) even though the studio hbo offered them more years to make the show and the money needed. i could probably go into individual instances of when the show changed course for the worst but i would be here for a long time. yet one thing that i noitced was that characters weren't acting like themselves. story arcs built over seasons where whiped out over a trivial moment. yeah so the creators dan and dave really lack talent in original story telling. its the people around them who have talent. george r. r martin., set desingers, costume designers etc. d&d where just riding the wave and happily struck iceberg and hopped onto lifeboat.....so overall i'm giving the how a 6. the first three seasons really deserve a 9 but the last two deserve a 2 or 3. so six is more than fair.. i know this show has a far higher rating but it's because so many people rated it while it was at it's peak prior to its downfall. so read reviews that were published after the show finished."
2019-05-20,jonas1969,Complete GoT series review,7,"the biggest tv,series ever created has concluded and even if you haven't seen it i'm sure you have heard a lot of comments about it. most of you who haven't seen it are probably sure it isn't for you, and you may be right, but here is my take on why it's worth watching.it would be easy to believe that this is a fantasy world like lord of the rings, but with more violence and sex, however that is far from the truth. magic is a very small part of got and the world is very much like medieval europe but taken to extremes. a world where the lords stab each other in the back first chance they get and violence and strength usually rules but the clever and ruthless also thrive.we follow several powerful families in their struggle for survival and dominance. the three most central families are the starks, targarians and lannisters. when the story begins the targarians have been ousted from power and the two surviving siblings are barely alive. the lannisters are in ascendance and on the verge of seizing the crown. house stark is the only family that seems to value integrity over power.from start to finish these families are central to the plot and we follow them over many years of struggle. quite a few die and none remains innocent,, but we get to know them all very well and learn to love and hate them.the first 5-6 seasons follow the books by george rr martin fairly closely, but the books aren't completed yet so the final seasons are noticeably not as well put together and with less brilliance in the dialog. seen as a whole this series is a fantastic achievement. for it's grandeur and scope and for it's ability to twist the plot ever which way. there are many large mysteries that are unfortunately never explained (i hope the books will fix that), but even so the main story arc is well worth the investment in time it takes to watch it."
2015-06-03,chiluvr1228,Unbelievably awful,10,"heard a lot about this show with everyone saying how great it was so i decided to watch it to see if it was as good as i was told. i found the first episode a little boring and slow but figured it was setting up the characters, etc.well from there it went downhill. i watched all of season 1 and half of season 2 and i couldn't stomach it any longer. in my opinion, none of the characters are all that likable and the few i did like get killed off very quickly, usually with much gore.then there are the numerous and pretty graphic sex scenes which seem to be thrown into the show for the purpose of titillating (pun intended) the audience who i assume to be in the 18,35 bracket. i'm not a prude, but i never saw any tender love scenes, just gay sex, incest and rape. it's pretty much soft porn with a story.by the last episode i watched i couldn't care less about who regained control of ""the mythical land of westeros"". i hope parents aren't letting their children watch this debauchery.everyone has their own opinion of what is a good show and this, in my own opinion is utter garbage."
2019-05-20,spiff-12,I am deeply divided by Season 8,8,"everyone complains about how dany's arch. personally, i think the personal story to be the best. she stopped examining herself and decided that everything she did was good and right. i don't have a problem with any of the acting or directing. even the writing was spot on (and i know people have problems with it) . i only wish they put at least half as much thought into the ending as they did for the creation of those characters. the issue i have with the show is the horrendous lack of respect for logic. did anyone in this show consult anyone who knew even a thimble worth of strategy!?a frontal assault by ""a"" class irregular cavalry against a massively larger group of, essentially, steady infantry who never suffer morale issues? why not just have them ride off a cliff!?speaking of dothraki...or, maybe call them the ""wile e coyote"" because no matter how many time we see them all die, they always come back.they died to a man in that ""dramatic effect"" charge. a bunch of them showed up at the funeral. 1000s died to almost a man when the iron fleet attacked. then several thousand show up at the gates of kings landing!? i don't get it... when they die, do they multiply!?speaking of obscene perversions of logic. how did a handful of people left alive in winterfell become an army that could besiege king's landing!?what happened to cerci's plan to have winterfell fight to a man against the night king and the sweep up the remains with her army. it would have made perfect sense except for the dracaris,ex that could destroy the world with enough bean burritos. that whole thing wreaked of a hasty (and highly illogical) plot change. it's sloppy. it's practically fan fic in this regard."
2020-01-12,stemelia21,Epic until is wasn't.,1,"first off seasons 1,7 were awesome and if i was rating just them an easy 10/10.just like all of the other reviews season 8 went and spoilt it. it seemed rushed and was unsatisfying. there was so much left unanswered and with a show this size you just simply can't do that. i cant believe this is how author wanted it. you cant help but criticise it. it rendered so many of the characters back storys completely pointless most notably jon snow's! they might as well have left him dead at the end of season 6 and filled the spot with someone else! daenerys would have gone crazy anyway! this page is not big enough for the complaints i have about season 8 and how much they got it wrong. anybody who says the battle at winterfell in season 8 was the most epic battle are foolish!it seems that a lot of directors/ producers/writers just dont know how to finish at the moment. maybe it's the pressure of ending something so big, another great example of this is the new stars wars trilogy. i dont remember feeling so disappointed like this at the end of harry potter! maybe because the story had already been written by an actual talented author / writer.up until the last season , wow! what a series. the battle of the bastards is the most awesome episode in the series and will remain so eternally. the series up to this point also did justice to the books. the casting/acting was good all the way through. i was truly heart broken with this series. it is still awesome and is in the top 50 series to watch before you die, it's just a pity because it should have been in the top 2.i'm rating this 8.5/10, it was going to be higher but i changed it through pure disappointment. that last season was a chaotic mess! it seems chaos isn't always a ladder."
2014-07-31,kop_reaz,"Excellent show, has been carrying higher potential, funny death scenes and unnecessary nudity",8,"after watching the first 4 seasons i've decided to give got 9 stars. but for all the unnecessary and awkward nudity, i'm talking away one star.got is about the iron throne of the 7 kingdoms. and people who are trying to control get comfortable on the iron throne. so they wage wars, people die. ""king""s fall. noble families decays. and all these unfortunate incidents are originated from ""incest"".this show is all about tragedy. it preys on your addiction to sadness. without tragedy, it would have not been a great success. but they could at least make the death scenes more emotional. i mean when i watched the show with my brother, we both laughed during the death scenes. so come on be more serious.the show is shot in 4,5 different european countries. and all of them offers beautiful views. it's one of the great thing about the show. the beautiful soundtracks will make get yourself lost inside the tv. the cast of got is very large and quite powerful. beside they need new casting members each season because a significant number of characters die each season.the show offers a great deal of violence and gore, which is acceptable for a show set in medieval time. but they really don't need to show these much nudity. i don't want to watch porn.got had the stuffs that makes a ""best tv show of all time"". it still has. but unless they stop playing it safe got won't reach it's full potential."
2012-04-02,showgirl626,Beyond magnificent,10,"*** spoiler alert *** game of thrones is lush, beautiful, gritty, harsh, bloody, and incredible. i love every character, bad or good, but peter dinklage as tyrion lannister is superb (and deserves every accolade he received for the role), and sean bean was transcendent as lord eddard stark , rough, weary, stoic and quietly noble. i was heartbroken when ned was killed.all the 'bad' lannisters are deliciously so, and i've enjoyed watching the evolution of daenerys targaryen from a meek little pawn of her brother's into a rising leader. i like iain glen's character as the exile who protects daenerys and keeps her(and the viewer) up to speed on the ins and outs of dothraki society. i liked the boozing, womanizing king robert, though i would have liked to kick him in the knee for being so obnoxious, and i even like that little jerk, little finger.the stark children with significant roles are also excellent, especially arya. now that the killing of potential robert baratheon heirs has begun, and the one we were introduced to last season being on the path to the watch with arya, their relationship will be interesting to watch.game of thrones has one of the strongest ensemble casts of any size i've ever seen in a program. though it took watching the episodes a few times before i could start keeping all the intrigues straight, it was well worth it.though i'm still smarting over ned stark's execution (but i'm biased because i'm a fan of sb's work going back several years), it was enough of a surprise to be refreshing in this age of done-to-death plot twists, and as the story evolves it seems clear that there's no more room in the game for a ned stark.thank you, hbo, for delivering yet another truly outstanding original series into our homes on sunday nights. i bought season 1 on dvd, and i've bought the first book in the ""song of fire & ice"" series. rarely does a television show have such an effect on me.9/10 stars. a bit heavy on the gratuitous sex, and all the f-bombs seem out of place in that world, but if i can be hooked in spite of those things, and willing to keep watching even after my favorite character is knocked off, by god it must be a damn good show."
2019-06-14,abzahidab,The best I've ever watched...,10,"there is no doubt that it is the best season i've ever watched. season 1 to 7 were outstanding but the two best seasons are 4 and 7.. now let's talk about season 8, it was all going perfect till long night but then the has spoiled the whole effort...."
2019-12-18,youngman44,It's Simple ... Greatness Fallen,10,"the show was brilliant for the first several seasons with multiple exceptional characters, the breadth of prime characters is unmatched in tv history.yet the show began to stumble after it moved beyond the books. it didn't fall immediately, it was one of those stumbles where you trip yet keep taking big steps in hopes of recovery.within that stumble was the attrition of episodes , down to 6 in the final season. each season should have had at minimum 10 episodes. the show runners were clearly punting.but, then, season 8. the greatest fail final season in tv history. d&d should be given a writing/tv ban for 8 years for that. it was appallingly rushed, miscalculated, and incoherent with the build up over the first 5-6 seasons.i am not in the camp of those who think the show can't be re-watched. i simply use my imagination to create a different final season and a different ending. it's as simple as that."
2011-07-18,mike_brunton,A grand sweeping Epic - truly breath-taking,7,"george r r martin, has done quite a job with his series of books, based around the 7 kingdoms and the fight for the iron throne. all i can say is thank goodness hbo got the rights to film this and not a bunch of pansies who would have made this into a watered down shadow of it's rightful self. this is war, this is death, this is sex and violence and family feuds and long held memories. it is fantasy and drama and comedy and wine and song. i will admit the acting isn't always perfect, and the budget forbids grandiose battle scenes or a cast of thousands! but still martin's vision shines through, the story is compelling to any fan of lotr , you know who you are, it also appeals to any medievalists or people who dreamed of lands beyond this earth. i am waiting the next season, and i truly hope this series gains in popularity and word of mouth until the whole saga has been translated onto screen. down with the lannisters!"
2021-01-17,napchier,DROPS THE BALL,3,"amazing, right up until they started getting lazy , with the writing in particular.10/10 for a long while, then we recieved a truncated 7th season, with irritating plot holes where we would have otherwise had full episodes, and then season 8 (similar problems) occured and made the whole investment seem like a complete waste of time.a further reduction of episodes for season 8, and a horribly rushed plot. i don't mind some of the outcomes, some, apart from jamie's arc - the worst outcome in my opinion - but the last bit of the journey to the story's conclusion was really awful overall, no matter what happened in the end.the directors did a great job, unbelievable really, when you consider what they were given to work with for the final season, so it can have some credit there - and the visuals were great - but that's all that was great, story wise it suddenly had no depth at all.i was invested in this for years! i still can't believe the astonishing let down that came to be delivered.seasons 1-6 i spent much of my time looking forward to the moment i could finally blast through it all, over the spell of a couple of weeks, and it saddens me to say that i will now never see it again. i feel sad for that dreaming, younger person, lets say about 3/4 years ago, that had no idea his hopes were about to be dashed.then again - maybe i could just watch until the end of season 6... at which point we reach the end of a significant arc anyway - so maybe that will have to do (though it leaves some significant things unresolved - actually no - i'll just forget all about it - and consider it ruined forever).i'd like to read the books, but i suppose that particular writer will pop his clogs before completing it all. have decided not to read it until it's all completed, which might mean i'll never get to.anyway - if you come here for a series binge - go in with reduced expectations - it will trick you into believing it will all turn out great, while it's good in the begining, but when it starts getting bad - season 7 onwards - know that that is the point where the series actually begins to die! that's the key moment to lower your expectations!"
2020-08-05,lavaside-60237,1st 3 seasons are good.,10,"it's all downhill from there. the writer kills off most of the best characters for shock value. the couple left by season 4 have to survive in order for the show to be interesting. so it turns the rest of the series into stereotypical storytelling. perhaps the writer brings in interesting new characters in the novels that hbo left out, so to keep the 'death of least expecting' rolling. and therefore the show limped along unnecessarily. one thing is for sure, once there was no longer any source material, the void that is the 'creative talent' in hollywood becomes obvious. and even though the 1st 3 seasons are amazing television, the rest makes any investment in them worthless. this show overall is a 6. people are kidding themselves grading it higher. nothing in those 1st 3 great seasons has any bearing on the rest. lol. the series, when grading the whole thing, is an absolute dumpster fire of storytelling."
2020-12-15,socalicimarius,The worst TV series ever made and the fans are getting toxic if you don't like it!,10,"i watched the first 5 episodes and i didn't liked them, should i watch the rest? nah i wish i skipped got, i don't want to watch it never again, trash series, i never was interested in this crap show anyway but i gave it a chance and wow is so trash, got is not for me ok got fans? got is not for everybody, grow up got toxic fans!"
2016-03-05,felixmartinsson,Can't get enough,10,"first of all , if you're hesitant to whether or not you should see it, i'm telling you to watch it, but you gotta give it at least 3-4 episodes before you're in. there is a lot of different character ans stories going on so you have to give it a chance. i my self got stuck after the first episode, probably because i'm an actor myself and can tell when a story is good. (does that even make sense?)anyway, this is one of my favorite shows ever. i've always liked this time period, and i got stuck after watching the first episode, and i've been ever since. it's rare to find shows that are as well made as films since they're under a lot of time and money pressure. this is for anyone who wants a lot of great visual effect, action, and cat-and-mouse game and brilliant storytelling. words to describe this show: bloddy violence, intrigue, epic, evil, sward fight,i give it 10 out of 10"
2019-04-11,maedhros35,An afternoon in Raqqa - but with dragons in it.,10,"i really can't tell what people like about this series. it's labeled as ""fantasy"" but mostly it could be labeled as ""war "" or ""horror"". the series as a whole is utterly depressing , everyone dies or gets raped or mutilated and it drags on and on from one morose black point to the next.if you like ""lord of the rings"" or ""shannara chronicles"", then please do not bother with this one. if you like "" the human centipede"" or ""a serbian movie"", then this gorefest will probably be of your taste."
2019-05-20,sandowl_,Poor Ending,9,"great series.the best of it is before seasons 7 & 8.terrible ending. found it really disappointing. difficult to explain without ruining it for others, so won't be explaining it."
2020-05-25,pierre-andre-17,Can we play some good serial without containing a lot of obscene episodes,10,"to be honest, it is a great serial and most americans love to watch it. but most people in other countries are shocked by the sexual episodes in this serial. i won't suggest any parent to let their teenage boys to watch this. if the kids want, they should want till they are adults.
classic is not the shield for lust.
and i don't think someone who appreciates the bawdy episodes in this serial do deem them a kind of artistry instead of another kind of po....
why don't you cut most of these parts? you can only use these parts as stunt to attract the audience? you can browse unbecome pictures online. why don't you still deem this a kind of artistry? can artistry be more innocent? if you think all of the behaviors in the serial is of nature, why don't you choose an ugly and unattractive woman as actress instead of emily?
this really reflects the general hollowness of our entertainment these days,those directors have to let the actresses do those irrespective things in exchange of audience. a pity!
people during these days have higher secretion of hormone and can't control their lust well. it is this kind of generally perverse entertainments distort their mind.
our serial will be the next big brother in this way. haven't you been aware of the fact that you lose concentration when you think but have more time to recall those lustful pictures?"

2020-11-20,marwillreview,How to ruin a show.,10,"when i first started watching game of thrones i fell in love with the world of westeros, the intricate story telling, the amazing characters and the dragons. seasons 1 , 6 were, what i like to call, perfection. the story telling and character development was all there. the world the writers built was amazing and understandable as they were basing themselves on the amazing work of grrm. then the incompetent ""writers"" david benioff and dan weiss ran out of source material and it all went down hill. season 7 started by having our one and true dragon queen return to her home. westeros. the problem with that was the tyrion lannister became an inept as hand of the queen. one of the most spectacular characters in tv history became the stupidest strategist in all westeros. as the season went on we had more and more stupid dialog. we had the stark sisters pinned against each other. i'm sorry, did the writers not now that the one thing starks love more than anything is their family and pinning the sisters against each other was just so stupid and the storytelling was not there. then, we have to talk about that horrific episode 6. beyond the wall. well beyond the wall is were you will find plot armor for most of the characters and an ice zombie that played all of these dummies just to get himself a bran new dead dragon. the fact that these writers thought that bringing a ww to kings landing to prove to cersei that the dead were coming just shows us all how bad dan and david were not able to interpret grrm work and bring it to the tv screen. now we move on to the last season. deep down in my soul i wanted to believe that the writers were going to give us something. build on all the theories and story lines grrm created, but we just got more crappy make no sense writing. lets start by the long night that lasted not that long. cmon! the night king was killed by miss arya stark. how? why? we had all this build up of jon and the night king finally battling each other. and also what was up with all the plot armor? jon should've died. sam should've died. arya should've died. so many more main characters were put in such life threatening situations that they should have died. then we move on to the last 3 episodes. so, ms. cersei now avidly people watches from her window. this amazing character was ruined. she did nothing and ended up dead at the bottom of the red keep, crushed by bricks. clegane bowl, in my opinion, was stupid and way over rated. arya surviving the attack on kings landing was, yet again, more plot armor. finally, daenerys targaryen. such a powerful female character tarnished by two so called writers. at the end of the day got will forever be one of my favorite shows, but i will never forget how it was ruined by two incompetent writers that by subverting expectations ended up ruining the greatest show in tv history."
2020-12-13,loleewardie,Outstanding from season 1-6,10,"season 7 was meant as a buildup to season 8, the final season, which is fine. the problem is the ending was poorly written and rushed. bad decisions from almost every character of the show, and really out of character decisions for some. the greatest show of our time ruined by hiring incompetent writers... sad. once the books ran out, the show quality declined really fast. they should of taken the original writer to write a script and not random idiots."
2016-11-17,info-12388,Let's see who we can kill off this week...,7,"lots of points for production design: the costumes are uniformly magnificent, from the lowest peasant to the highest king. the sets get a tad monotonous after a while: big, colonnaded halls of dark beige and grey and lots of oversized statuary, but even those can be breathtaking in their own way. the cg work just gets better and better with each season: tighter, cleaner, more layered and intricate. many of the performances are quite good, even after six years, and the photography is outstanding.that's the good stuff.the bad? ok, i""m halfway through season 6, binge,watching the dvds, and the sins of the series are becoming so obvious that the writers are in real need of a walk of atonement. having not read the books, i don't know how closely they're adhering to them at this point — or if indeed they even are anymore, since i understand much of this season was planned in expectation of the next book which martin has yet to finish. but increasingly, each episode is a combination of (1) some characters wandering around the countryside in the snow, (2) some characters getting killed off for no particular reason, and (3) one really big cg-laden scene somewhere towards the end to keep you coming back to see what happens next.my biggest complaint with got s1 was that it felt like the old tv show ""dynasty"" with a lot of fur costumes: lots of rich, powerful people going after each other in a somewhat pointless way. s2-4 gave it a bit of a rise above that, but s5 and (thus far) s6 have almost completely reverted to type: fantasy soap opera with furs. at this point, i'm not sure why the show has lasted this long: the story lines seem to be running on auto-pilot. there hasn't been much with the same visceral impact as the red wedding. by now i would have hoped to see at least something of where the series hopes to wind up, but instead it's just wandering in the snow.i understand that it's been contracted for two more seasons. i'm starting to wonder if any of the major characters will even be left by then, that perhaps they're bringing it to a close because no one will be left alive to sit on the stupid iron throne. that would be almost as disappointing as the ending of lost, but at this point, certainly not outside the realm of possibility."
2019-06-07,alfredtimothy,Producers sold out,10,"producers had the opportunity to create history but greed got in the their way in the thirst for more assignments they screwed this show and the ending in any movie or series has a major impact how we feel about the series as a whole they basically rushed the 8th season messing up what could be the greatest series ever
that's bad and arrogant on their part"
2019-05-24,type-a1pha,Shame of Thrones,10,"the ending of this series is a disservice to the public!the first seasons are great as they are based on the books source material and, apparently, the writers are good enough at adapting other people ideas. after season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. it's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value. where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world,spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. it's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. it's everything that is bad in mainstream media.all of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. so they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the star wars franchise (more than it already is). thanks for your disservice!it needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. the quality is amazing. it probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. it just doesn't pay off. the ending season ruins quite literally everything."
2019-12-23,mariamelkott,The best series of all time,8,"before hating on me first read. everyone is blaming david and dan . but the truth is this is george's ending. he told them the ending years ago. he said it himself in a fan convention that you can find on youtube. we all agree on it being a little rushed . it was only 6 episodes to have 3 villains (one turned to a villain) is a little too much unless the episode is 2 hours long. making it a total of 12 regular episodes . now lets discuss the characters acrs
jon : he never wanted to be a king . he wanted to be free. he loved ygritte because he felt free with her . going beyond the wall with the free folk is his freedom. he is relieved from the burden of being in charge and he was done fighting. this is a happy ending for him.arya : we all know she was rebellious . she used her faceless men training to kill the night king. and she avenged her family by killing the freys.sansa : god i hated her at the beginning then she became one of the smartest people on got . she saw how the north bled from southern rulers. all what she did was to protect her family and her people.dany : there were many hints of her fate since season 2 . her madness was always there. mental illness can be passed through genes too. losing her best friend , her loyal friend , 2 of her dragons , the love of her life and her claim to the throne in a very short time can drive anyone nuts. she was abused her whole life . and an unstable person with endless power can become ruthless. she got what she deserved and broke the wheel just like she wanted.bran : he is far from useless , because of him jon knew who he was . which influenced sansa manipulating tyrion and varys trying to kill dany. and driving dany mad. because of him they knew the night king breeched the wall and gave them time to prepare. he can now see the future. you can see he didn't flinch when nk was going for his sword because he knew arya was going to kill him. and to the question about why he didn't say something to stop dany ? if you watched many time travel movies you'd know that messing with the timeline could lead to worse events.him being a king makes sense too. he can get married . he doesn't need gold or glory . he was stripped from his emotions when he became the 3 eyed raven . he can't be manipulated by greed or power.
cersei : her death was poetic justice . the keep was the source of her power . that power dropped all over her head and killed her.we can all agree or disagree. some wanted to see dany or jon or both ruling together. but all we can agree on is got has a very large fan base and they can't please everyone. but don't disrespect their work because you didn't get the end you wanted."
2021-05-28,dillon-77085,Why haven't you seen this??,1,"i got into got quite a while after it had flattened all in its wake. in all honesty i have to agree with the fact that by season 6 and into 7 and definitely with 8 that there was a noticeable drop.in quality.however after season 5 you could guarantee that everyone was going to watch it until the bitter end come hell or high water. havent read the books so cant compare. the characters are engaging, entertaining, infuriating, irritating, syntilating and confusing all in equal measures. the writing although irractic in quality is nonetheless nerve shredding and captivating and weaves inbetween the lives of several characters at the same time. the number of unexpected.twists deaths of well known characters.im afraid makes complete cobblers out of all those who insist oh yeah i saw that coming a mile off. the.part i deviate from most views is the ending yes i would have liked various people to.have got poetic justice. but the end was in keeping with the rest of the show.unexpected and surprising. so i'm afraid i have no problem with it. would i have done it the same way hell.mo but can i live with this version hell yeah. performances are brilliant but some characters of course you will like more than others. if you like lord of the rings or your into fantasy adventure this is gonna grab you by the throat and swing you around the room it's a roller coaster ride and you may get sick on that ride but all the pieces fit. one of the most addictive things you will ever see."
2019-05-20,ratpackaustin,"Was a 10/10, now all rewatchability is ruined",1,"let me start by saying i love game of thrones, absolutely love the characters and world that it presents. the acting is incredible, the cinematography is unbelievable, and the writing (up until season 8) was fantastic. however, this show is basically broken up into two different shows: game of thrones seasons 1,6, and game of thrones seasons 7-8.seasons 1-6 were breathtaking and addictive. i never watched the episodes live, i would wait a few weeks and binge watch them on hbogo. this was the best way to watch in my opinion because the show was son addictive that i would spend 5+ straight hours just laying in bed watching it. this show could do no wrong in these seasons, it was 100% the greatest show of all time.but then comes seasons 7 and 8. don't get me wrong season 7 was still good, but it was easy to see that the writing was getting sloppier and it was slipping. the show spent less time on dialogue and story, and more on action and fast pace. season 7 also set up the disaster that was season 8. what the hell happened in season 8? i won't spoil anything but let's just say that characters don't act like themselves, they make stupid decisions and act like they did in season 1. none of them grew to end in a spot that they deserved to be in. there's also too much time spent on nothing, literally in this season you will watch characters getting dressed, staring into space, sitting there with a blank face, or weird montages of characters walking. seriously this show is about deceit, dialogue, and the ""game"" that is game of thrones. but nope they abandon it all in this last season just to rush the ending and try to shock you.overall this show is fantastic if you ignore seasons 7 and 8. even with them it's still a good show, but i can never rewatch it knowing that it leads to the conclusions it did"
2021-01-17,louis-47618,I can never forgive.,10,"i remember watching got when it first aired, it was perfect and it only got better and better. this was like a religion to me, i would have rather watched this than the birth of my child.
that is up until s7. they absolutely butchered the greatest show ever made.and that i cannot forgive or forget. 1 star to many in my eyes."
2020-05-24,lluca-47748,"Great show, but quite dry",10,"it is a great epic show with gorgeous cinematography, epic story and complicated power games. i only watched seasons 1,2 when they were available on netflix; after that i wished i could have watched more seasons, but i was not that invested to pay network subscriptions or buy from on demand. my impression was it could have been a video game. best memories i had from those 2 seasons were that was a lot of doggy-style sex. there was no powerful romance, which made the show dry. also, not much subtlety in stories, quite superficial i give it a high rank because it was enjoyable and captivating. then i got to the rest of the seasons, which i found completely outdated, repetitive and overinflated with fight scenes. the last 2 seasons were terrible."
2021-02-06,tharsheyn,10/10 Here is why...,1,"so i've read the entire book series multiple times(still waiting for winds of winters release), and the show does a good job of bringing that all to the screen, there are a bunch of inconsistencies here and there and events that have been changed but mostly it does a good job. i give it a 10 out of 10 because up till the last book the seasons have material to be based on and they do a great job of it. the last season or 2 tho having no source material because book ain't written and published yet definitely falls short when the writers and directors have to continue the story without george r. r. martin there to save them. acting, special effects and all that is great. i've watched this series twice and i gave it a 10/10 as most if people's hate comes from season 7/8 which i don't like myself but hey i still got the books lol. if george ever finishes the damn things lmfao!anyway if you are brand new to this world of westeros then you will love the series, if you watch this and loved it then read the books they're even better(duhhh).winter is coming (words of house stark)"
2021-10-16,xanderlm,Impossible to hate,5,"between cinematic effect rivaled by even few movies and other elements, i have yet to see a tv series match it or even come close. before game of thrones with the exception of breaking bad and maybe a few other series, very few had kept me glued from beginning to end. it also did what few have done and not only kept you guessing from episode to episode (whether it be who falls in love, who changes from good to evil, who dies, who comes back, new relationships made, old friendships ending and so on)but also built from the first season to the last progressively. it had an extremely grounded, reastic, morbid, grim, brutal, sad, and other negative effects type of storytelling with few bouts of positive triumph, but that's what made it amazing. because the dark moments sure become so much lighter when everything seems to be lost. although many won't approve because of the liberal use of nudity, sexualism, profanity and graphic violence, i defend it wholeheartedly. what in the news and nowadays otherwise is all that much different, at least this one has good writing and equal elements of good. the art direction is impeccable, the writing and acting are perfect across the board, and the visual effects and practical effects are outstanding, especially given this is a tv series and they are better than what most fantasy movies put out. i can't applaud the actors enough, the supporting actors made most lead actors in other series look like amateurs, the leads made most of those in their class look like supporting actors and the good definitely made it easy to cheer for them while the evil were more than capable of carrying out a good effort for people to hate them. if you are into fantasy, medieval, or just good acting entertainment in general and can at least sit through the elements that you consider obscene or over the top, you will love this show , frankly i find it almost impossible to hate it."
2011-06-11,bektaskonca,best of the best TV series,5,"i could not believe my eyes after watching the first part i was hooked. at a friends recommendation. i started to watch this series although i have not watched tv for 15 years or longer. just been watching house md online never on tv . thanks to a friend now i can not wait for episodes to show online. there is not one flaw in this movies and i mean it. directing is top notch, script is top notch and i don't think any one can argue if i say acting is award deserving. i am hoping this will not go south like so many others before it and they keep producing better and better episodes. i have not read the books every one keeps telling me about it but as we all know nothing can be as good as a book as episodes have a limited amount of timing. so lets not get in to that argument i find it stupid any one compares books to the films. as it stands this series is a must see but not for under the age of 18 highly recommended"
2020-10-29,spencergauldin,The Best Show with the Most Disappointing Finale,3,"seasons 1,6 really are some of the best fantasy tv that you could watch, especially season 4 in my opinion. characters were strong and made great performances and the consequences of their actions turned out twists that enriched the story. tyrion is by far the best character in this part of the series with his performances and lines and showing how smart characters can influence the story. season 7 was ok, but it was too rushed and some character choices and logic started to get questionable. then season 8 made some expectations not matter anymore and made you feel empty and disappointed. for having such a great run for the majority of the show, the finale had to be great or it wasn't worth it. i love the best parts of the show so much, i could just rewatch those parts. but if i want to actually rewatch the show, it's hard to do it because the finale was too disappointing after learning the fate of my favorite characters and how they turn out. there used to be tension where you wondered if your favorite characters would live. it came to where their choices didn't affect their consequences that much and the tension just wasn't there anymore. i hope grrm finishes the books to where we can get the true finale and someone like netflix or some other network could reboot the series. if you want an example that it can work, compare the anime series fullmetal alchemist to it's reboot fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. brotherhood is better because it's the true story that the original author of the manga planned out that didn't have concepts or stories made up like the original series because it was made when the manga was still being published.
do it for game of thrones. do it for the sake of the arts and entertainment."
2017-03-19,avraham_tal,Not worth the time,2,"i don't understand why people like it so much. i really tried watching it but could not continue after a few chapters. of course, the investment in production, costumes and effect are evident, but the plot, with its very trivial 'political' hints simply is not enough to make this series what it is claimed to be. maybe it is mainly intended for people under 18.disappointing."
2019-03-05,chrille98,Best show ever created!,9,i have watch this show 8 times and its still good i wont say anything about the show because this is somthing you med to watch without knowing anything !
2019-05-20,chrille98,Rating this show 1 why?,10,why are you guys rating it 1? just because season 8 was no as good then the other seasons. this show is the best show ever made no matter season 8. guys think of the the other season and dont judge the whole show just because you did not like season 8 that is disrespectful for the actors and for the people who works hard on this show. the truth is i never ever have loved a show like game of thrones and it will never be one like it.
2021-05-22,lostcinematheq,Game of Thrones,1,"seasons 1, 2, 3 and 8 were a little dull for me, but seasons 4,7 were truly a golden age for the show and i found myself getting very engrossed in the rich characterization and world building. seasons 4 and 5 in particular were absolutely breathtaking."
2021-02-15,seb_3,I recommend this to EVERYONE!,7,"to say this short ""this is the best tv series i have ever seen"" i loved the show and watched these people grow up and mature. watched and felt everything from the ups and downs.and... i know they sadly messed up the ending, and they started rushing every plot line and ""pissing"" on the caracthers that george rr martin and the show established just for the sake of plot twist towards the final season.
which is sad to watch and see as the story slowly falls apart.but the journey. the journey is worth it non the less, with all the insane plot twist, great dialogue, beautiful locations and the awesome characters that you grow to love or hate more and more for each episode, for each season. this is truly stunning in every way. it manages to be raw and thought provoking, but at the same time be beautiful and heartfelt.this is truly a must watch for everyone, even though the end may not satisfy. the journey getting there is something everyone needs to experience at some point in their life. this surely gave me something, an experience i will never forget.10/10."

2012-10-04,bdwilneralex,"outstanding, but, I'm afraid, most likely popular for the wrong reasons",10,"""game of thrones"" is an absorbing soap opera that combines elements of high adventure; realistic, gritty medieval lives and mindsets; and a touch of black magic. it is utterly clear to me that,-ranging from names of characters to detailed settings and physical artifacts--much material is generously lifted from the likes of j. r. r. tolkien, r. e. howard, c. s. lewis, and c. a. smith, but, just perhaps, borrowing (inadvertently or otherwise) from the titans of sword and sorcery is not intrinsically evil.i was just a tad disappointed to find that our coming third season is going to rely upon zombies as a major plot contrivance: while a bit of black magic or supernaturalism (e.g., dragons; and persons immune to fire) is fine--even thrilling--here and there, i fear that the show will degenerate into too much dependency upon ""walking dead""-style tactics that rank firmly among the ""been there, done that."" time will tell whether my fears are (hopefully) unfounded.but i fear, most of all, that the show is popular for the wrong reasons. fundamentally, i have profoundly little faith in the ability of the american populace to appreciate what is valuable in a show. i'll be brutally frank: i don't believe the show is popular because the characters are engaging, or because the swordplay is interesting, or because tyrion engages in fascinating tactics or because joffrey is full of sadistic surprises: i believe it's popular because characters routinely spout the ""f"" word; characters are continually shown engaging in frontal nudity, full-body sex (everything just short of an xxx rating being shown)--to include both gay and lesbian sex; and characters are routinely beheaded and tortured in full view. indeed, i am dead-certain that the average joe who does, in fact, watch this with his beer buddies does so so that he can (a) appear to be awfully mature when a nude woman or a heterosexual full contact scene appears; (b) demonstrate to his adolescent-minded cronies how disapproving he is (yeah, sure) when characters engage in gay sex (although--double-standard wise--i'm sure he'll hoot and holler when girl-on-girl contact is featured); and (c) laugh along like one of the tavern crowd when bawdy songs are sung or necrophiliac slogans are shouted.sorry, guys: the show is fantastic, but--in my ultimate opinion--much of the popularity of ""game of thrones"" is due to the american audience's fascination with sex and gore, not because of its intrinsic excellence, which is most considerable."

2019-05-22,bef1991,Amazing Ending,1,"i thought the ending was fantastic. i don't understand why people are so upset about it. it was incredibly poetic with a shakespearean ending. there were so many incredible moments from when daenerys gave her eerie hitler speech, tyrion finding jaime and cersai, jon's talk with tyrion, jon killing daenerys, drogon melting the iron throne and then carrying her off and the final seasons.i honestly don't know what kind of ending dissatisfied fans wanted. hats off to the producers, directors, crew, and actors who pored they're heart, sole and time into this magnificent production. it was earth shattering television and it will be a long time for we will see anything on this scale."

season 4season 8 of game of thrones was a mixed,bag for me and i was so disappointed! game of thrones' final season shortchanges the women of westeros, sacrificing satisfying character arcs for spectacular set-pieces in its mad dash to the finish line. overall: 5/10season 7 was pretty good and entertaining to sit through. this is where they stopped following the books and went for their own type of story to finish it all with a more focused interest in its central characters, stylish action scenes and spectacular surprises and set-pieces. overall: 7/10season 5 was filled with enough expectation-subverting moments to make almost everything about it worthwhile. bloody action and extreme power plays return full throttle, as this season enjoys a new-found liberation from the world of the source material, resulting in more unexpected thrills. overall: 8/10season 6 was satisfying af and was freaking incredible as it still stayed true to the books. bloody and captivating as always, this season plunges back into the midst of a world touched by grief, dread, and precarious sexuality. overall: 8/10season 3 is simply an amazing and an absolutely incredible season. this season continued to deliver top quality drama for adults, raised the stakes even higher and left me hungry for more. overall: 9/10season 2 was when everyone around me was crowded to see where this show would go on and go forward and it kicked off . this season follows up a strong debut with an even better season than the first, combining elegant storytelling and vivid characters to create a rich fantasy world. overall: 9.5/10season 1 was when i started to watch from start to finish and i will never forget the first time watching this show. its intricate storytelling and dark themes may overwhelm some viewers, but game of thrones is a transportive, well-acted, smartly written drama even non-genre fans can appreciate. overall: 9.5/10season 4 is the best season for me! absolutely everything that i absolutely love about this show is in this one season. game of thrones continues to be one of the best shows on tv, combining meticulously-plotted character arcs with the spectacular design of the seven kingdoms. overall: 10/10series overall: 10/10
i will forever love game of thrones and i will forever appreciate the amount of care and effort that was put into this show. this is my all-time favorite tv show and no other show, in my opinion, will ever come close to this masterpiece. even though season 8 was disappointing and it was debatably bad for its rushed storyline and character arcs being destroyed for subverting expectations, i still throughly enjoyed that season even though it is definitely the weakest season of the show. season 4 was filled with everything that i've always wanted and seasons 1-4 were simply masterpieces in their own rights. seasons 5-7 were good until the 8th season which was just not as good or as outstanding as the seasons that came before it. but anyway, game of thrones is my favorite show ever and a song of ice and fire is one of my favorite book series ever and i'm really anxious to see how grrm will end the books!"
2019-03-01,meelaleks,Truly great series! (except maybe last season),1,"i have just one advice: watch it, and afterwards re, re- re- watch it (you will find new things every single time) edit: but you may want to skip the last season, somehow it doesnt match with the other seasons. it feels, dunno, lesser in quality, in storytelling. and it misses the soul previous seasons had, even though they added (way to long) conversations. the surprises are a mostly predictable and the 'grand final' is decent but not strong, it even feels rushed. what irritated me last season as well is that 60% is set in the night or dark and can only be watched in a darkened room (and even then its hard to follow what is going on at times) so sadly i changed my earlier 10 star rating to 'just' 8."

2017-09-08,daneldorado,Expensive failure,10,"""game of thrones"" is a massive, spectacular television experience... that tries to be a massive, spectacular television experience. it is all flash and no substance. the ""battle of the bastards"" was spectacular, all right. but it went on for too damn long. reel after reel, of ancient swordsmen striking at each other, frequently killing their enemies right there on the field of battle. how long? oh, maybe twenty minutes. too long. too damn long.cersei's ""walk of atonement"" was impressive too. i thought it was carried out with great solemnity, every step made painful by the teeming crowd hurling insults at their fallen queen, as she stoically marched in complete nakedness, through hundreds of loud and contemptuous rabble. it made a great impression... until we learned that the actress, lena headey, used a body double to do the famous ""walk."" that's right, ms. headey showed us not one square inch of flesh. it was all done with an anonymous body double. what an effin' gyp.the scene where daenarys (emilia clarke) was rescued from her enemies by a flying dragon was spectacular too, especially since we know that flying dragons do not exist in real life. the scene was dependent on the tech wizards making us believe that the large machine that transported daenarys was, through cgi magic, a real, living, breathing giant reptile. that, too, was impressive. but i will bet you, dollars to donuts, that the one factor that keeps people tuning in to ""game of thrones"" season after season, is the nudity. i haven't seen all the nude scenes in the show, and i don't expect to. i only know that nude scenes of young and youngish bodies are a great attraction, and the producers of ""game of thrones"" know this full well. does this not strike you as a compelling stratagem? well, know this: all the reviews of this last, seventh season, report that from now until the end of the show, the remaining nude scenes will feature male nudity rather than female nudity. how does that grab you? dicks, not boobs, will be center stage. so, i won't be watching this final season. and you can take this entire series and dump it into the deepest recesses of the deep blue sea.cheers, dan"
2016-05-21,slowpulse,A disappointing bore,10,"i realize i'm part of a painfully small minority, but nevertheless, here goes. i only managed to get through the first season and even that took a lot of energy. i love fantasy as a genre, so it's not like i started out with preconceptions, but the initial exhilaration turned quickly into disappointment once i realized the whole series was based on a very simple structure: 90% of each episode sees two people, sometimes three or more, in a room, a hall, a hut or in a garden, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.... and then talking some more, mainly about past deeds and dead rulers. and the whole concoction is made so much more arduous to watch by the amateurish direction, which relies on the ""artistic"" choice of showing a close up of the speaking character, then switching to a close up of the next character talking, then back once more, over and over again. every now and then there a horseback ride and sometimes, all too seldom i might add, there's a brief sword fight. that's it , that's the big show everybody's so giddy about. i don't get it."
2021-07-14,borowiczlucky,5 because of the possibility the worst ending ever,9,this show was amazing! from the wardrobe to the cinematography to all the characters. great character work everyone in it nails their part. no one was safe from the axe made it even greater until the end. the last season was so rushed it set up things that ended on a whimper. then it decided to destroy it all!! it could've went down as one of the best shows ever but the ending killed that.
2019-05-21,wentworthstreet,Time for a comedy remake of GoT?!,4,"this rating is purely for the well acted but ultimately unsatisfactory and frankly unworthy season 8 episode 6 finale of got. not sure if it was d&d's intention to deviate away from or stick as closely as possible to grrm's ending. either way, for many , including myself - what had been a magnificent, game-changing series came to a rather sorry and mundane end. rather like a magic carpet ride that ends in a nondescript industrial estate in the middle of nowhere. these beloved (and loathed) characters deserved a whole lot better.so, in order to cheer-up disappointed fans, hbo should forget about plans for prequels and spin-offs and announce immediate plans for a comedy remake of got with an entirely new cast.for starters, here are a few lead actor suggestions:matt berry as jon snow, dawn french as daenerys, miranda hart as cersei, kathy burke as tyrion. the dragons and direwolves, so excellent in the original version, would now have an opportunity to display their comic range.you can decide other casting choices amongst yourselves!"

2020-08-16,numenorsniper-66396,What happened?,10,"my introduction to got came when i was travelling in tasmania back in early 2012. some fellow travellers who i became great friends with recommended this series i had never heard of before, and one night at our good friend's house in the middle of the forest at the base of an epic mountain near deloraine, just as the sun was setting i began episode 1 of the first season.within the first two minutes, i was hooked. i then watched throughout the entire night all 10 episodes back to back, until the sun rose.shortly after that experience came the beginning of season 2, which a bunch of us fellow travellers would watch together on a big projector screen at our friend's place in deloraine town. every week, the anticipation and excitement for each new episode had me/us engrossed and impatient for its release. each minute of each new episode was gripping. this feeling persisted every week with each new episode, for years. season 3 was earth,shattering for many of us. when ""that one thing"" happened in s3, i felt upset for the whole week until the next episode.season 4 was great, but it started feeling like the season of autumn in some ways. season 5 onwards felt in some ways like quantum of solace compared to the casino royale that was the first 3 or 4 seasons. in fact season 5, 6 and 7 feel like a blur in that they all meld together in my mind as an inferior knockoff compared to the first seasons, albeit with some poignant scenes and moments scattered throughout.certainly seasons 1-3 or 4 feel very rewatchable, or at least felt rewatchable up until season 7 when i felt i no longer recognised what i originally felt i fell in love with from the first seasons. then season 8 came, and now i can't watch got ever again, knowing where it all ends. what happened?all the golden memories i had over the years watching got with friends, i will always remember those moments and times with great fondness... but also now with sadness and confusion, as season 8 effectively threw it all away.dan and dave... i have just one question for you..... why?"
2020-09-28,anankit-77756,A Perfect Series with Terrible ending,9,"s01,s07 are good and wanting you for more, it's s08 where all things goes horribly wrong. jon snow was one of the strong minded character throughout s07 but in s08 he is completely blank character.
daeneyrs character on the other hand was saving slaves and people from brutality throughout s07 but in s08 she goes crazy killing the whole city for no reason even after winning the war and suddenly she thinks she did a great job. why jon snow becomes night watch in the end and what the hell is role of night watch anyway in the end? the wall is gone, white walkers are gone, wildlings are now staying with normal people. what's the role of night watch now?
writer was lazy enough to give proper justice to the character like jaime and cersei. tyrion and varys, one of the most intelligent character of got becomes idiot characters in s08.
that's nothing but a horrible, illogical and mindless writing.if this is the ending got team, writer, director wanted to go with then they needed one more season so people can adopt the story and motive completely instead of suddenly changing all the characters motive characteristics."
2013-06-26,joec345,Great Books = Great Television Series,7,"not since j.r.r. tolkien's works has someone created such a masterful and complete fictional world as george r.r. martin. his extensive world with its numerous characters inhabiting it, is a joy to read about in the books and to view on this brilliantly adapted television show.the numerous main plot points and side stories which are all inhabited by various characters that pop in and out of each others individual journeys make these books much more fitted for a television series rather than adapting it into a series of films that would most undoubtedly end up leaving out a number of characters and plot points that would leave the ignorant viewer confused and would not do justice to the books.of the numerous pov characters that appear throughout the books and television series, some of the most prominent ones include tyrion lannister (peter dinklage), daenerys targaryen (emilia clarke), arya stark (maisie williams), stannis baratheon (stephen delane), bran stark (isaac wright), jaime lannister (nikolaj coaster,waldau) and you know what? there are just to many to mention. the way that the above characters intertwine with all the other characters inhabiting their world is masterful.the world that these characters inhabit is plagued with civil strife and rebellion after the death of the king with many believing they have a right to sit on the iron throne and command the seven kingdoms of westeros. with in-fighting and treachery abundant in each of the regions the path to the throne is not as easy as it would seem. along with the battle for the throne, the regions of westeros are starting to become increasingly aware of a threat from beyond the their borders in the north and from the uncharted regions of the continent of essos. magic seems to become part of world again and disciples of the lord of light challenge the practiced faith of the faith of the seven of westeros.one of the attributes of this series that makes it so enjoyable is the fact that no one is safe from the dangers of the world, no character is ""invincible"" as becomes apparent after the first book.not wanting to reveal to many plot points i will this review here, but one last thing i will say is this: pay attention to the details of the earlier episodes series and chapters of the book, and don't get to attached to any of the characters because they might not last as long as you think they will."
2021-03-07,glaneljhonathan,I'd like to confess something honestly.,10,"i really believed that that got ending, especially the night king arc was unrealistic & terrible. but this pandemic season unleashed a lot about humanity than i had realised earlier or underestimated. having witnessed such scenarios in real life, i am more than willing now to forgive that ending, because i realised it just might be true & realistic after all, & that it's some kind of metaphor to our current reality. people actually can behave like they behaved in the show, even in the face of detrimental crisis, especially when it's distant to them; & go on to continue about politics as the number one concern no matter what.the 9 rating though, is only an average for the 7 seasons. there's still plenty wrong with season 8, which i can't overlook, considering it's a show after all."
2019-05-20,gherota,B.E. !,9,"as opposed to bs, got was the best ever ! forget about those poor miserable trolls who for a pittance smear the hard working and talented crew of the got.
one has to be a bit educated and read a few books to be able to grasp the depth of this show.
maybe 90% of got was able to show the real life, with ups and downs, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, loyalty and treachery and the list goes on and on.
for almost ten years ( well ... almost ...) we grew up with a story told by a wonderful bunch of ladies and men , at the beginning girls and boys some of them dead now, but hey that is life !
the story of life... watch it.p.s. now i will buy the blue ray and force my wife to watch it. the same was with breaking bad and she love it ."

2019-06-03,peter_nilsson88,"Watch Seasons 1-7, They are Fantastic! (and forget that Season 8 ever happened...)",10,"i did not watch a single got episode until summer 2016 and watched season 1,6 in just about 2,5 weeks. the story got me in its grasp from the very first episode and oh my was it a fantastic experience!i went in with quite low expectations thinking the show was going to be lord of the rings but with lots of sex, nudity and violence making up for the lower quality. oh man could i have been more mistaken?the show is about the game of the iron throne with families competing against each other, using mostly words instead of viloence. of course there are super natural elements, battles, violence and sex but this is heavily downplayed and not the focus of the show. instead the show is about intrigues, relations, honor and betrayal, claims to the throne, loyalty and followers swithching sides. there are characters who are just there to play the game, and a rich history from events occuring in the past that are important to understand. and the dialogues and writing are fantastic with lots of humour and sharp dialogue.the actors are just amazing with every actor perfectly cast for each role, and to see them develop over the seasons, and for some actors also seeing them grow from children to adults, is a remarkable journey.game of thrones should have been the best show ever made with a solid 10/10 in every aspect if it weren't for season 8 and the ending of the show. every aspect that made got outstanding is just forgotten in season 8 and it ends so poorly, pointless and dumb it's just sad to watch. season 7 had an amazing build up for the end but the just blew it and created an ending i couldn't even imagine being this bad. if they had just got with the obvious ending and slided downhill with a season without surprises it would have been ok but there is just nothing positive to say about season 8.i would receommend season 1-7 to anyone. it's a fantastic show and i will probably re-watch it one day but i will skip season 8 to spare myself from the butchering of the show that once was, and should forever have been, the greatest tv show in history."

2019-05-08,rajaramautt,Watch till season 7 then wait for book,9,"what a garbage season 8 is , most stupidest writing , anyone can write 1000 time better story than this garbage. there is so many unanswered questions and plots , winter came and gone just like that. seriously i have wasted more time for this worst final season. i have read fan theories which are so much better than the final garbage we got. i feel sorry for everyone involved in making this series except writer. there was following lines i saw from movie that ""the characters change should come from the character not from writers"", till season 7 we can see and live along with the character and their development but season 8 so rushed and ruined everything. some people defend the worst final season , i don't understand why ?"
2019-02-13,marcvuijk,Why game of thrones is one of the best tv shows ever made!!,10,"from the opening scene followed by the amazing ""game of thrones"" tune, you know you're in for something very special. game of thrones shows off his high budget and really immediately draws you into its beautiful created fantasy world.
from the start they show they mean business and you soon realize that you have never seen a tv show like this.
its beautiful landscapes, cities and the amazing diverse set of characters is mindblowing.
from the beginning you get to know these great characters and you get to get really involved in them, whether you love a certain character or you absolutely dispise a certain character, game of thrones does it really well and it feels like you get to know these characters really well over the course of the current 7 seasons.
all i can say is.... fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the ride, get ready to be amazed, get ready to be shocked, you will cry, you will be in awe, this show has it all.
an absolute masterpiece that will leave all tv shows behind itself and makes you wish for more as soon as you have watched the last episode.
warning: this show does contain shocking scenes that might not be for everyone.final verdict: this is isn't just a tv show its an experience not to be missed,a must watch for anyone who loves a great story, great characters and doesn't mind the occasional shock value!!
oh and did i mention..... it has dragons!!!!
enjoy everyone😉👍😊"
2019-09-18,ava792,Well! Believe the Hype!,10,"i was too late at watching this show. i had once started when it first aired but couldn't continue to watch for some reason. then it got so popular and with all the spoilers, couldn't bring myself to watch it. well i never had any interest in watching this show and with all the spoilers on social media i basically knew all that was happening and i thought i already knew everything so what's the point in watching, right?! but i couldn't have been more wrong. well it goes without saying game of thrones is something special,i liked it throughout. it has such great characters so well written and the plot is something way beyond imagination. the characters i most liked were arya and tyrion and well jon snow (who doesn't love him). arya was the best for me, her character development throughout the show was amazing and she's everything a young girl would want to be. well not to kill someone but the courage she has and how fierce she is. so it was all great. and apart from the grand verdict i did like the ending."
2019-01-23,jimgigs,Thrilling,10,"amazing show. everything about it is well done, the acting, writing, cinematography all outstanding. i watched the first seven seasons and now in anticipation of the final episodes have watched from the beginning once again. if i have time i may watch it a third time. so many good characters, so many good story lines. so many plot twists. i read a reviewer that says people you despise at first you come to like, people you love, you come to hate..so true. the character development is a main component of the story. the harshness of life comes across so realistically. the brutality of hand to hand combat is captured magnificently. there's nothing negative to be said about it. anyone that doesn't like it should just stick to watching big bang theory or blue bloods or some other network trash show, they're not worthy of this type of entertainment."
2020-04-30,sublimineyes,Needed better knitters in charge but thoroughly watchable,7,"i read the first couple of books back at the start of the 2000s and decided then that i'd leave reading the rest until the series is complete and i can read them all together. obviously hasn't happened yet. but i chose to do the same with the series, so have watched this all over 2,3 months, which means my opinion may well be different to people who watched it at first airing, season by season. anyway...the good the overall plotting, pacing and dialogue, the overall quality of acting talent, the overall direction, the consistent feel (despite multiple directors), the ""no treating the audience like children or idiots"" approach. i really enjoyed the series.the not quite so good
the change of tone (a bit lighter) in series 3 that jarred a bit with seasons 1 and 2. i think the added lightness was a good idea as the full on seriousness of seasons 1 and 2 would be too serious if stretched over many seasons. so i'd have had it in 1 and 2 too. just a sprinkle.the unfortunate
a decade down the line the sex and nudity does feel too much (especially early on) and, more gratingly, does feel like voyeurism intended for male viewers. it is good to not stray away from sex and nudity but in this show it does feel almost entirely as though it has been written from and for a male perspectivethe weak (not bad)
many reviewers complain about season 8 not living up to the previous seasons. for me the threads began unravelling years earlier. didn't much affect the series enjoyability but there were simply too many threads that needed careful pacing together (as martin did skillfully in the books and the tv series did extremely well in seasons 1 and 2) and loose threads that broke the spell of the overall fabric.the weak (bad)
outside the 7 kingdoms. inside things are (for the most part) well connected and fleshed out. outside, i found everything lacking either or both of these elements. this was particularly jarring for me when anything ""not like us"" north of the wall was dealt with. for me, this was by far the show's biggest weakness and is simply unsatisfactory."
2012-07-19,jojifrey,An excellent TV series,6,"i am new to this series, never read the books before, but having completed watching the 2nd season made me wanting it more.i have always been a fan of fantasy movies, so when people appraised this series because it is comparable to lotr, i was intrigued.the first episode in the first season (after the prolog) was utterly boring.... i have no clue at all what this series about.so my curiosity got me better, and i continued watching the whole season with laptop nearby so that i could google more about the characters and their history. and after a while i realised, these actors are superb, i appreciate the beautiful back ground, the script, the directions, the dops, the sound mixing, the plot... every element in this series is well concocted. no wonder it could deliver one of the best tv series i have ever watched satisfyingly... the author is involved as well. *i wish if there is a harry potter tv series the author would be involved as well with the script* anyways, my fave female character so far is daenerys. emilia clarke's performance is simply great. and fave male character is either tyrion or petyr. but then again, all actors did a very good job, no body delivers a bad performance.and my fave episode is blackwater... the best battle episode in my history of watching tv series!"
2019-02-05,omega145,Lives up to the hype and then some!,1,"what can be said that hasn't already been said about this show? quite frankly, it's the greatest tv series ever created. movie quality acting, set design, storytelling, cinematography, costumes....the one knock is in some of the early episodes cgi not being up to par (dragons mostly).the show is brilliant in almost every way. never before have i been as surprised by the outcome and been along for an unpredictable ride of what happens and what is to come.my previous all time favorite show was breaking bad and there's a wide gap between got and pretty much anything else already out there. the word epic is thrown around too often these days as are 10's for anything that's halfway decent. got is as worthy as anything else being labeled as epic and deserves a 10 in an imperfect grading system."

Martin is a genius!,10,"i have never been more impressed,with a more gripping and unforgettable show.the characters.plot.action.theme.all make me want this show to never end.you could say this show is over,perverted,and disgusting,but without that you would only have accented people having never-ending dialogues over wine.i have never seen a show with more depth and motivation in their characters.even those who get annoying george r.r. martin fixes somehow.unforgettable one liners,cool action,and ever revolving plot,will keep you forever entertained.unless you don't like extremely graphic content (the shows only fault),this show will be perfect for you!"

2014-09-26,xodanielcasterox,"It is such a dark, dark world. AND I LOVE IT!",10,"wow! seriously, wow! i never thought i would say this even though this show does get political sometimes (i never understood politics so there's no reason to be invested) but this is the most intriguing, shocking, heart pounding suspenseful, intense, hardcore, gut,wrenching dramatic, fantasy drama series i have ever witnesses in my entire life! i see why it trumps the sopranos. i just adore how heavy and dark this show gets every time i watch it. it's a show about seven noble families battling their way to take the throne in westeros. it's slow at times but it's a long journey, it''s supposed to be slow. there's a lot of focus on the characters--which are a lot, by the way--but my favorites are tyrion lannister played by peter dinklage, arya stark played by maisie williams, and most of all the gorgeous mother of the dragons who steals the show, daenerys targaryen played by emilia clarke. there are other interesting characters but those three are my personal favorites. tyrion is a dwarf but a very intelligent, smart-ass, shakespearean member of the lannister family, the most hated people in the entire show. he knows his family's a group of evil people and they are his family but he doesn't agree with their methods very much. he's the only lannister in the family who's close to being almost good, regarding him as more of an antihero. arya is a very young, strong, courageous child who is more of a fighter than a child and fights with her thin sword called the needle, though she is still a learner, but brave nonetheless. it's so admirable that a child this young (probably 14) could be so daring and tough. and daenerys is a girl (probably in her twenty's, she looks young) who becomes the mother of dragons--which, to the special effects' credit, look really impressive--and uses them to fulfill her goal: reclaim the throne of westeros. she's basically a conqueror with legitimate motivations which also makes her an antihero/hero. there really is no main character which makes the show more intriguing, but those are my personal favorite characters of all time. i won't give too much, it's better if you go to www.cokeandpopcorn.ch and watch it. aside from the fact that it get's political sometimes, there are other intriguing stories and characters that i think you would thoroughly enjoy. it's so dark, dramatic, exciting, brutal, and unpredictable. game of thrones, one of my favorite shows ever!"
2013-07-06,richcarter1962,Want to Be Entertained; Pull Up a Seat,9,"before i write a review i like to take a look at the ""loved it/hated it"". i do this before watching some movies/tv shows that i am uninformed or wary of wasting my time. i have to say i can't even remotely relate to what the ""hated it"" folks are rambling on about. this series is well cast,(and a bit daring i think for casting peter dinklage (the dwarf) in one of the primary roles), he is excellent, you're not sure at the start of the series if your going to like or hate him but by the end of season 1, if you're anything like me, he has become one of your favorites. lena headey and sean bean are really the only actors that i was familiar with before watching got, but each character seems perfectly cast to me.i did not watch this on hbo and therefore did not have to wait for weeks or months for the next installment, and thank goodness, once i started watching it was almost impossible for me not to go ahead and watch the next episode because the end of each episode left wanting more, and isn't that what a really good show should do.i will say this, i was startled by this series in one way, they are not shy about killing off main characters in this show. i know that this is based on the series of books, a song of ice and fire, i have not read them but i understand that they stay very true to the novels, but i would have found this just as startling for a novel, i won't spoil it for you by saying which characters but i will say steel yourself they come fairly often.because this is hbo there is a fair amount of nudity, sex and some fairly graphic violence, but i found none of it offensive nor gratuitous, but if that sort of thing bothers you it is the only reason i would say not to watch this series. i have watched all of the first 3 seasons and now can't wait till season 4 begins, i hope you will enjoy these as much as i have."
2019-05-20,vandykeu,Excess and gratuitousness mar and otherwise brilliant story,7,"i've been a got fan since i stumbled across it by accident when hbo was playing reruns of the first season. right away, i was hooked, and read all of the books by the time the second season was half,done. the show is a tremendous production that was cinematic in feel from the first episode to the very last. the acting, design, set, etc. are as good as you'll find anywhere.the plot, while brilliant early, suffers as the show passes the source material. the showrunners had a major challenge to figure out how to nail grrm's story, which is famous for its meander. they mostly succeed in distilling a more coherent plot (except for dorne). some of grrm's excessive characters/storylines are ditched, and the story is easier to follow. however, after season 6, the showrunners apparently decided they would rap it up in 2 shortened seasons (though with much longer episodes in season 8). the result is... rushed. i won't say the ending is terrible. it's ok, and it is, in broad strokes, true to the characters. it just doesn't really feel earned.now for the excess and gratuitousness. the show is famous for some of its missteps, which are not from the books. the books are admittedly graphic, violent, and sexual. the show takes this to the next level by including gratuitous nudity whenever it can. sometimes, it serves the plot and makes sense. other times, it is just over the top, and i sometimes felt a little insulted that i was meant to be titillated by what i was seeing. in later season, this feeling progresses as a lot of scenes are gratuitously violent, or even just gratuitously fan-serviced. daenerys uses drogon to torch kings landing because... reasons? but i wrote that in my review of that episode so i won't revisit it here. another gratuitous scene that feels over the top is when robb's wife is stabbed repeatedly in her pregnant belly during the red wedding. scenes like this, which aren't in the books, serve merely to amp up the shock factor of already graphically violent scenes. is it necessary? not really, and again, it feels as if i'm meant to be titillated.speaking of daenerys, the show doesn't serve its female characters very well. rape is used to invent plots for major characters on at least 2 occasions, and it really doesn't have to be. daenerys' turn to evil is expected, but again is rushed. brienne, cersei, yarra, missandei, ygritte, and even sansa to a degree all are relatively unused in major parts of the story, or make decisions that are out of character. and let's not even mention the dornish women- the whole subplot of dorne in season 5 is nonsensical.of the female characters, only arya really gets a fair shake from the story. she's brilliant, and her actions and decisions always feel both correct and earned.tyrion's plot is also difficult to follow. from season 1-4 he is the smartest character. then, from season 5-8 he becomes the dumbest, and by the end is made hand of the king (again) so that he can ""fix all of his mistakes""? he is clearly meant to have learned humility from his overconfidence. maybe, but it just doesn't make sense.at the end, perhaps my biggest complaint is on military matters. the tactics used in some of the battle scenes are just atrocious. perhaps more impactful is how the number of soldiers present seems to grow and shrink at the need of the scene. the best example are daenery's dothraki and unsullied army in season 8.they march into winterfell with what looks like her full original complement- 8000 unsullied and 100,000 dothraki. nevermind that many of her unsullied died in mereen seasons ago, and many must have died in their attack on casterly rock as well.then the long nigh. the dothraki charge into the darkness right away, and essentially... disappear? we barely see any of them after that. the next episode, daenerys also says she lost half her unsullied, so we're down to 4000 at most. then some number of her troops die on the ships taking them back to dragonstone. she has barely any at kings landing.once the battle of kings landing starts, its clear that her army (including jon's northern and vale forces now) is meant to be outnumbered by the 20,000 golden company and few thousand lannisters.then afterwards, in the final episode, it looks like she has way more than 8000 unsullied, and suddenly tens of thousands of dothraki are back. it's like she didn't lose a single soldier in any one of the battles! where is the consistency and attention to detail that we see everywhere else?anyway, this has rambled on long enough. it's a good show, but it's not great, and it's not without flaws. i still am greatly entertained by it, but i am also troubled by it."
2019-04-18,metaick,Greatest Show of All Time!,10,"i don't understand those who have never seen this show. this is, without the shadow of a doubt, the greatest show of all time! this show transcends a t.v. show and actually creates an entire world that exists. why anyone would willingly deprive themselves of this journey is beyond me, but if you are one of these people who thinks they have something to prove by not jumping on the band wagon, you need to wake up and get on! there is no doubt that this show will be revered and remembered as the best, throughout this lifetime and the next."

2020-07-31,nafisbinreza,Fantastic,1,"game of thrones , drama series season - 08
the most well known series of all time. i think almost everyone knows something about this series. in my opinion this series is good but a bit of overrated. the plot of this series is not that much attractive for me as i don't like violence that much. but overall the plot was beatiful. i found the series to be somewhat boring in the beginning and i started enjoying the series from season 4. there are some interesting storyline that had really low amount of screenplay like the story of the faceless man. the graphical work of this series is really praiseworthy.
however, i found the story has slow build up and lack of character build up. there were many unnecessary characters and their stories which had too much screenplay time but not that much significant contribution to the story. the fighting scenes and use of new tactics made the war scenes so much interesting. from this series i came to know how brutal people were before. adult scenes were too much in my opinion here. and the fun part about the story is the main throne had not that much of power or advantage rather it was a fight of houses. overall i must say i liked the series so much but i am not mad about it.
personal rating - 8.5/9
(best time to watch it during corona)"
2019-03-29,rickysayet,The best of the best millenium drama,9,"cant deny it, this is the only show that are watchable eventhough some of it episode look boring, but everything is very highly quality from the cast performance, storyline and the special effects. highly recommend for someone who not watch this yet. warning; not suitable for children as it has a highly violence scene."
2019-11-09,enzotadah,Quite interesting now that I'm in my early 20s.,10,"growing up throughout my years of grade school i always followed the rules of in not watching raunchy stuff until i'm older than 17, and i was disgusted by bad language, blood, and graphic sex. but now i see that's everyone likes about g.o.t.; blood and gore, graphic sex and dragons. i'm not exactly caught up on the show, but so far i like jon snow because i kind of relate to him, daenaryus because she's the mother of dragons, arya stark because she's a fierce young warrior and she's my age, and tyrion lannister because he's peter dinklage."
2019-10-12,darshanr23,10/10 if not for season 8,10,game of thrones was crafted brilliantly from season 1 until season 7 . season 8 went totally south. poor writing and disappointing end to a highly anticipated final season. overall this show has set quite a bench mark to be breached in future for other shows.
2019-04-16,tequila3434,Nothing will ever compare,8,"i admit i am a late bloomer to watching got. i have always wanted to, but living in a different country for the first few years after it premiered prevented me from seeing it. i just started it in january of this year and wow, i never realized how much i was truly missing. this show is incredible. the acting, storylines, shock value... i don't think any other show can ever live up to got's overall strengths. it can be hard to keep track of the characters but once you get a few episodes in you're hooked. yes, i'm not going to be in denial, some episodes were boring, but that doesn't detract from the majority of the amazing episodes. i feel bad for people who had to wait a year in between (and 2 years from the last) between seasons. i felt spoiled being able to binge watch the show in about a month. if you're one of those ""i can't start now because i'm so behind"" people, don't be! i promise you will love it and i'm hindsight you will be like how did i ever survive. literally the best show ever."
2020-04-01,d-82284,Magical drama.,5,"""game of thrones"" broke the magical drama ""magic"" with its high attitude of ""creating miracles"", subverting the creative level of all hollywood magic movies in one fell swoop, becoming an insurmountable peak in the magic film and television industry. it gives actors, directors, and screenwriters unlimited creative possibilities. with its unlimited and orderly creative space, it includes thousands of full,featured characters, weird and unique imaginative local customs, and its complete space, rich details, the narrative's delusion is sighing."
2020-04-10,geislekm,Binge watched the whole series during coronavirus lockdown,6,"i watched all eight seasons within a week, and was surprised at how many things i had forgotten, and many other connections to events i never made the first time i watched it. the show holds up very well, and to be honest, watching the ending seems appropriate. yes, a wildly popular character died (if you consider a death on this show to be a spoiler, you really are a newbie), but to be honest, there were only two possible ways this thing could end: either the game continues and the death toll mounts, or the game ends and peace can finally happen. as i get older, i think i like the chosen ending more."
2011-04-25,dangermous,fantasy that bites,10,"well i've seen up to s01e02 and already i can see this is going to be passion filled character driven tv at its best. this is fantasy designed for adults not kids. the story seems complex and has more layers than an onion!i'm glad its hbo doing this as they have the money to keep up the obvious high production values we've seen so far. hopefully they wont mess it up!the cast seem perfect for the roles they are playing. sean bean and lena headly have the focus and passion to make this the best tv has to offer if the writers can pull it off. so much potential. already i'm feeling strong empathy for certain characters and my imagination is awash with ideas as to what will happen next.i haven't described the story , read the imdb description for that. these are my thoughts after the first couple of episodes."
2017-08-21,thearthurfleck,One of the nail biting TV serial,10,"one of the best tv serial in hollywood history. one of the best thing in game of thrones is they have only 10 episodes per season (except season 7&8). a year of waiting for each and every season, its really thrilling experience. game of thrones: 1, best casting 2- best making 3- best cgi and vfx 4- best theme music (title card) 5- overall best tv serial history.when u r waiting for the next season, everyone those who read book make theories for the next episode, it is really interesting ... kind of made everyone happy, especially when jon snow died and came back to life.. :)when u heard last season will take two years to telecast, that's the real pain. :("
2020-07-19,lithint55,Overall good,10,"i watched this series in two weeks (almost 70 hours runtime ) and when i finished it, i felt satisfied to an extent. the characters were good the story was good the vfx works were especially good. the only things i didn't like were some unwanted stories included which thereby making the duration a bit overlong. this could have been a perfect experience if the runtime was around 30 hours, the unnecessary gore and nudity could have been avoided to make it more appealing to the general audience. overall a nice experience."
2014-08-10,a9amouse,Most Overrated Show in History,10,"this is easily the most overrated television program in history. it is the forrest gump of tv: a bunch of assorted vignettes, shot using actors who (on the whole) lack any notable prowess, and then haphazardly forced together with minimal connective substance, all with the intent to quickly evoke and dispel fleeting and superficial emotional responses from an audience whose attention span is about as long as your average commercial advertisement. no scene is particularly visually stunning, no storyline is particularly compelling, and not much of the dialog is particularly well,written.if good film making allows the viewer to be drawn in to empathize with characters and fully experience each scene, game of thrones is a nightmare. it's difficult to make sense of the overall experience of the characters or really feel much of anything because game of thrones is such a desensitizing roller coaster. for instance, the show reached a point where the writers had to kill off nearly the entire family of protagonists because they couldn't find any meaningful plot twist they hadn't already used. this heavy-handed amateurism rewards the voyeurs and sensationalists at the cost of desensitizing everyone else to any events that could still evoke an emotional response.yes, there are a ton of characters and story lines. but, every character seems generic, because there's not enough time spent on any character in particular. yes, there are many layers to the story. but, no, none of the story lines are very deep, nor do they demonstrate the patient hand required of a great writer or director. why is this the highest-rated thing i've ever seen on imdb? i struggle to make sense of this.the only insight i can glean from listening to the people that religiously watch this show is that the fantasy elements of game of thrones bring in the lord of the rings crowd, the marvel comics crowd, people who are happy with whatever schlock you throw in their face as long as it has to do with something mythical or a super hero. these are the people that made the avengers one of the most successful movies of all time - despite the fact that the only good acting in the entire movie comes from robert downey, jr. these are the people that keep scarlett johansson employed - despite the fact that she isn't really good at anything, whether acting, stage fighting acrobatics, being likable, or even just looking pretty on film.game of thrones is essentially an amalgam of the tudors and spartacus with mildly better acting and effects. if you can't accept that, go make another stupid meme or internet game about it."

2011-10-17,gsic_batou,Outstanding is an understatement,9,"television as a medium rarely rises above mediocre levels of quality, concerned only with ratings to up its publicity income. yet, every once in a while a truly remarkable achievement flashes briefly before the eyes of those carefully looking. game of thrones is such an achievement. its carefully chosen location and cast, the seamlessness of its narrative and character development and its unrestrained but cautious building of its own fantastical world work so well together that a viewer could not be blamed for thinking it all came together magically.fantasy is a complicated genre. so much of it is clichés and replaying of old ideas, and yet, when done right, its worlds can successfully reshape our entire thinking of our own. game of thrones begins with a beautiful introduction of its world in its opening credits, which in these days tends to be reduced in so many shows to the series titles and the producer and director credits. in the opening, we understand the layout of the terrain, and immediately perceive the importance of the divide of the map by ""the wall"". this introduction is very clever, as it helps to visualize all the movements of the many character in the game of thrones.as for the characters, rich in detail and significant and intertwined story lines, they are one of the biggest treats. you care about them the moment they come on the screen, and even if most can be identified as good or bad the moment you see them, the narrative manipulates both them and viewer enough to carry us constantly into unforeseen narrative developments.without spoiling its hard to speak of its themes, but all that is common in fantastical stories you will find here, from betrayal and honor, and manipulation and love, but with a more brutal and uncompromising view than most other shows. even if dragons play a part, this is not a child's show. it's themes are that of adults.the winter is coming, and it will be a long wait until the next season."

2014-06-21,gogga1011,Boring dullness and high expectations,10,"this series is clear evidence that a top production does not necessarily mean a good product. it is too notorious, but under all that thrown money has almost nothing. except of course loads of nudity and perversion for the younger generation. without nudity this series would be a fiasco because the main plot is a combination of santa barbara and the hobbit, and dynasty, with an emphasis on dynasty (in the middle ages). hbo with this series pushes the boundaries and approaching pornography, but it is obvious that sexual perversion, blood and violence is for today's generations everything in life. too bad, if producers used a bit more rr's book and reduce these annoying dialogs, we would get a lot more dynamic, better product."
2021-03-02,carobertson95,I really enjoy this show,8,"honestly it's an amazing show. unlike most people i enjoy the final season, they kept it unpredictable. i think people just got so hype about this show that they weren't ready for it to end so when it did they got upset. that's just my opinion but even if you don't like the final season, the show is massive and there is still huge rewatch value. i've seen the show 2 times through now and will watch again once we get closer to the prequels."

2017-08-13,dlpburke,"Yes, folks, it's falling apart. Season 5-7.",8,"season 1 to 4 = 10/10. season 5 = 9/10.
season 6 = 7/10.
season 7 = 5 /10.
season 8 (so far) = 3/10.pretty soon, the only people who will be defending this show will be the dumbos and easily pleased...tvw = tv writers.since the tv show left the books behind (around s5 on), the show's writing has gotten worse and worse. i think the first poor episode is probably the one where arya is being pursued by the t, 1000. it is utterly absurd. but this season (s7) has been by far the worst.aside from the odd decent moment, and the awesome spectacle of the dragons, it has been average at best. melodrama has replaced a proper narrative. contrivances have replaced logic. let me give you some examples:1. daenerys has spent her entire time planning to invade westeros. and when it was finally time to do so, the dumb tvw threw a spoke in the wheel. out of nowhere, she suddenly can't hurt any bystanders, so holds off the attack on king's landing (yeah, 'cause she hasn't had to hurt any innocent people in order to get to the position she is in now, has she!?) this silly little contrivance is designed to prolong cersei on the throne (itself a really dumb idea) as long as possible in the most artificial way possible. the tvw are completely shitting on logic in order to force this demented mexican standoff. the latest episode goes even further... a proposed alliance between cersei and daenerys and jon - to defeat the army of the dead. jon and co have to prove to cersei that the army is real by capturing one of the living dead. just think about how dumb that sounds. as if tyrion, or daenerys, would be entertaining anything of the sort, especially at this moment in time. tyrion would never even advise it, because he isn't stupid enough to trust his sister for any reason.2. the long awaited reunion of characters was handled in a really clumsy way. it was dreadful. where was the real emotion with sansa- arya or bran-sansa? it was non existent. it was like these people were just ordinary buddies who chanced upon a meeting. i was really looking forward to seeing the reunions, because we have been waiting since season 1 for it. what a complete let down that was.3. characters are everywhere, at any time; it's almost as if they've been chatting with seth brundle. daenerys hears that the lannisters have taken highgarden - and the next minute, her army is right there with jaime in the thick of it. the continuity has gone out of the window. whatever the writers want to happen happens. magic wand, lazy writing.4. melodrama / soap opera nonsense. in the last episode (s7e4), i had to suffer watching jaime being saved by bron in the most ridiculous way there is. the cliché and brainless 'last second save'. and then, as i fully expected, we open episode 5 to discover they haven't been captured and have miraculously managed to escape unscathed, floating in deep water while wearing armour and a sword! holy crap. that's what happens when you run out of actual genius (martin's work) and have to work on your own crappy, limited brain (tvw).5. characters aren't behaving like they should be. i've already mentioned daenerys in regards to this, but it extends across the board. bran ""ooooo i am suddenly not bran anymore... but i can feel who he was"" or some slop. he still hasn't explained anything to anyone, even though the world is about to do battle with a mortal threat that he understands better than any other person on the planet. sansa's turned into some awful caricature, totally alien to who she is as a person. and don't give me the ramsay bullshit, since that was a dumb tv move in the first place and never happens in the books. cersei is somehow queen and ultimate ruler, and making logical tactical decisions. but, here's the thing, it's already been established long before now that she is a useless tactician, and a naive, childish brat, who has no leadership qualities. but that's all out now, because they need her to be a main antagonist on the show. speaking of cersei, her one remaining child died and her emotion to it was zero. that's after it being well established that her only reason for carrying on with life was her children. oh, but let's just switch off our brains again. the tvw said it's all ok! whoopi-doo.6. contrivances. for example, jorah mormont needs a cure. suddenly, he's managed to trek to some sort of hostel hundreds and hundreds of miles away, seemingly to just die - where he meets up with sam - who not only finds a cure in a random book, but manages to pull off the delicate procedure, explained within, at the first time of asking. then jorah is back with daenerys super-quick time. it's just so damn lazy and transparent.7. dialogue. this has taken a big hit as well. it's always been the case that the writers think swearing is uber-cool and shoehorned it into as many places as possible - but now they are out of martin's material, a lot of the meat is gone. tyrion stands out the most. the tvw are in over their heads. they are out of their depth.does anyone think martin will be remotely this incompetent? the tvw have always made a mess when changing things (very often for no sane reason) from the books. for example, army numbers and population numbers being exaggerated to absurd levels; ridiculous and unrealistic events, like sansa marrying ramsay; over the top swearing, sex, nudity - for no other reason than to appeal to the mindless, lowest common denominator. but this is worse.it's still entertaining, but the quality slide after s1-4 is larger than people are admitting. some cool scenes with dragons isn't making me blind and dumb to all these issues.edit. at least e7s7 was decent."

2012-12-30,russmillerwy-957-682439,fantasy porn,7,"hbo puts a lot of sex in its dramas, even the ones that compete for awards. most of their shows have a kind of rhythmic cycle,- 20 minutes of drama, 30 seconds of porn. game of thrones goes a lot farther than once every 20 minutes. if i didn't know it was based on a book, and so many reviewers weren't raving about how faithful it was to the book, i'd swear it was just an excuse to create a very expensively produced dungeons and dragons themed porn series. instead of the sex spicing up the plot, the plot seems designed to create lots of opportunities to have a lot of sex. there's sex between fraternal twins, gay sex, extramarital sex, brutal sex, orgy sex, prostitute sex, little people sex, rape sex, and some other varieties i've probably forgotten about already. none of this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does make the show seem less serious, or at least harder to take it seriously. this also makes it a kind of anti-narnia or anti-lord of the rings, as romantic, sentimental moral idealism doesn't figure much in this world and there are no religious themes to speak of. these often duplicitous characters are simply trying to make their way in a hostile, cynical, and steamy world where dragons and zombies are just part of the landscape.on the plus side, production values are extravagant and lush and most of the cast is first rate. this is the first mostly belfast-based show i've ever seen and vividly bright green is everywhere. some of the costumes, particularly the fancier armor suits, are incredibly beautiful and are no doubt up for some emmy nominations. maisie williams, a 14-year-old actress playing a character that's probably a few years younger, is remarkable. don't worry, she's too young to make it into the porn scenes. nikolaj coaster-waldau, a danish actor without a trace of an accent, also stands out as one of the many evil-yet-charming-and-good-looking villains. aiden gillen, previously the uppity city councilman on the wire, is both from ireland and in this.so, will you like it? not if too much sex annoys you. on the other hand, if you've always wanted to sexually liberate the knights, maidens, dragons, and dwarfs to make whoopie on screen, this is absolutely the show that will do it for you."
2013-05-21,pablo2896,"Wheel crafted, well done, a good experience",6,"now that i just finished the first two seasons i'm seriously surprised. this tv show is truly something to be amazed about! right now i'm really trying to find a flaw in it but i just can't. i thought of everything, the pacing, the cast, the direction and i even dared to question the amazing production value! but i couldn't find a single main thing, maybe the occasional out of pace scene but nothing to distract you if this amazing journey. let's start with the plot, it is an adaptation of the famous series of novels a song of ice and fire from george r. r. martin. like you guessed i haven't read them but i'll congratulate george for such a deep and rich universe and characters! but you are gonna ask, can this show really pull you into this story and make you like the protagonists? the answer is: absolutely! i found myself cheering for tyrion as he led his forces in blackwater bay! i liked hating joffrey's guts and seeing what other horrible things he could do! and i liked immersing myself in jon snow's journey to the mysterious and wild lands that lie north of the wall! the story is so engaging and it never gets lost in the overwhelmingly big cast of characters. there were a few times where i said ""woah, who was this?"" or ""what was this dudes name?"", but nothing overly complicated. the actors are great, they are full of charm and fit the characters. the ones that really stood out where peter dinklage as the smart and cunning tyrion lannister, sean bean as the honorable and loyal ned stark and last but not least, jack gleeson, playing the and sometimes chilling joffrey baratheon! another thing i want to talk about is the astonishing and amazingly crafted presentation. it takes you in... no, it sucks you into this world and makes you care about it and feel part of it. i swear every time i see it i just sit back and enjoy my time in westeros."

2013-03-28,cracker,Banal Fantasy Soap Opera for Teenagers,9,"take every fantasy cliché' you've ever seen or read, repeat those in a dull soap opera format that plods from subplot to subplot, and you have ""game of thrones."" why are way too many of the character in shows today written as female characters regardless of the actual sex of the character? giving lots of dialogue a ""prissy,"" ""catty"" tone that rings hollow like a soap opera? where are the male characters speaking and acting like men do? i simply can't imagine feudal warlords having prissy repartee like modern hs students, yet ""game of thrones"" is full of it. fantasy themes are supposed to be at least as much action as character or dialogue driven. this show is 95% talk and 5% action. got is dirt cheap to make and formulaic.season one wasn't all that bad, but the second season of this show is one of the worst examples of ""hook the audience, then bleed them out slowly and rip them off"" i've ever seen, straight off a midway. it may be the worst season of a television program i've ever seen, and i've seen a lot.avoid this if you are over 14 or under 14 and reasonably intelligent."

2013-02-08,tuomas_gimli,"Incredible, one of the best works of modern fantasy fiction",1,"i'm just joining the choir in saying that this is a truly amazing show. there is very little negative to say about it. everything clicks together: the acting is beyond fantastic, the production values massive, the visual design convincing yet just otherworldly enough to feel unlike our reality. the dialogue is truly exceptional: in this series simply watching two characters talk can be just as, if even more, exciting as any swordfight or heroic quest. all the major characters are well,rounded and excellently cast. a special mention must go to the child actors, all of whom are simply fantastic in their roles. despite there being a ton of characters they all have a part in the story, and the individual stories rarely drag on.it's actually easier to list the few nitpicks one might have about this series than try to explain all that is good about it. first, some of the characters sometimes border on caricatures, especially king joffrey. second, the massive amount of nudity and sex feels at times gratuitous, sometimes hanging on the edge of good taste and can make you feel slightly dirty watching it. third, though not much of a criticism, more of a thing to be told is that there is some grisly stuff on display in the series which can be hard to watch, especially during the second season.but beyond those three tiny nitpicks, one can find very little to criticise about this series. this is, quite simply, one masterful series, and is showing no signs of slowing down."
2012-09-24,pluginyourbrain,First Season is Great. Second Season not so great.,1,"the first season of 'game of thrones' is some of the best television i've ever seen. it's as compelling as it is moving. the characters are well fleshed out. even the villains, as you learn to like them before you learn to hate them. unusually even the children have a rich, well,developed characters. the stories, actors, story telling and art direction are amazing. i applaud hbo for their guts and commitment to quality in making a tv series to such a high standard. it puts movies to shame, and we get to enjoy it for much longer.the second season is a let down. the high-quality production values are still there, but the story grinds to a halt for most of it. although there is supposed to be a war going on with the starks winning and the lannisters losing, you wouldn't know it. both sides spend nearly all their screen time sitting in camps, talking. that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the dialog lacks the power of the first season. the problem is one of pacing: a lot happens in the last two episodes, but nothing much in the first eight. the story of the kahlissi and kahl in the first season was, to me, touching and epic. when the kahl finally died i felt i'd spent a lifetime with them. at the end of the first season as her loyal tribe and knight jorah knelt before her and the baby dragons, i thought the second season was going to be a treat.instead they wandered around the desert a bit, then headed to a big city to stand around eating nibblies at parties. i wondered who was minding the dragons. and when her dothraki tribe was eventually slaughtered and dragons stolen, i though, well, duh. there's no convincing explanation for her sudden blinding obsession with claiming the iron throne, or why her fierce dothraki warriors are so easily defeated. it's sad to see such a promising storyline languish.when the awesome men of the night watch rode north i was expecting some gripping drama. instead john snow gets lost and hangs out with a wildling chick. the wildling's were a major disappointment: i imagined them fierce and well, wild, like celtic warriors or the picts of robert e. howard's conan series. instead there is nothing wild about the wildlings at all. they're too clean, well-spoken, well-mannered and despite being separated from the south for 8,000 years haven't even developed an accent.some of the characters suffer from the ""idiot in the attic"" syndrome. after yoren of the night's watch dies so that plucky arya can escape, she stands there and lets herself get captured. i'm finding lady catelyn stark a little hard to take. she speaks rudely to people whose help she needs, and let's face it: she started this whole war by falsely imprisoning tyrion lannister when it was clear to all he had nothing to do with it: 'who would use their own knife for an assassination?'perhaps to keep production costs down or not turn off its female fans, there is very little fighting on screen until the finale. yet they replace it with, of all things, infanticide. yes, i know many royal families have been historically vile and throughout history it was common place, but it's still disturbing viewing especially if you are a parent. the second season isn't all bad by any means and those who stick through to the finale will be rewarded. the entertaining peter dinklage's tyrion lannister steps into the role as the lead protagonist. the plotting and machinations at king's landing are still well told. rob stark has quickly grown into a man. bran despite his young age rises to the challenge of ruling winterfell fairly and justly in his family's absence. his step family of osha and hodor are endearing, as is his relationship with maester luwin. the greyjoy's rebellion is tragic to watch. game of thrones is not a series that you enjoy because so much of what goes on is so unpleasant, but it will immerse and suck you into another world for an hour a week.there's enough here to keep you entertained, though the second season is not of a standard that will attract new viewers. to be fair, i'm told the problem is with the source material in that the second book on which the second season is based is nowhere near the caliber of the first. i only hope with the third series we see game of thrones return to it's original high form.first season: 10 / 10. second season: 7 / 10. third season: ?"
2014-04-29,shakor77,Good but overrated,4,"first of all i would like to say that i have not read the book so how much it stays true to the books is not something i have considered. with that being out of the way i am a huge fan of fantasy stories, mostly high fantasy but also low fantasy.game of thrones although considered high fantasy feels a lot like low fantasy in the sense that it is not so much about fantasy creatures such as dragons and orcs, although those do exist, but rather much more about political intrigues of various powerful families and in that sense reminded me more about medieval times and how the monarchies fought each other.however game of thrones is set in an imaginary world and definitely has supernatural elements so in effect it could be the perfect mix of fantasy and realistic story. and although the series is quite good i feel it falls short in two key areas.one is that it often feels anti,climactic. many of the important key plots are often concluded in a very short time, after a very long and slow buildup, which for me has left me quite unsatisfied. i can't go into details as that would be a spoiler but let's just say that there are things that you have waited for the entire season, just to finish quickly and with a whimper rather than a bang.the second key area where it fails are the battles. most of the them situations are resolved very quickly and in many times not even shown at all. rather it is built up slowly, sometimes over several episodes, and once it actually happens you don't see anything! rather it is just explained, after the fact, what the outcome was. i think, after watching three seasons, i saw one battle which was satisfying to watch and even that comes nowhere near the epic battles of movies like lord of the rings or even spartacus (the series).and for a fantasy story, be it high or low, it is inexcusable to have such poor battle depiction and the main reason why i scored it a 7 rather than a 9."
2017-09-09,disizzgsk,Game of Thrones is Number One Series over a Century,9,"i cant write more lines to explain about this great series. i was addicted by harry potter in my childhood to watch crazily entire all parts, i love that so much imagined so many times in real life. when comes young age i saw lord of the rings, a superb movie after longtime. but game of thrones is very different every episode touched my heart and mind blown always. ever best made series in hollywood, i gave 10 rating may be it is low also in my opinion. all the characters wow such great creation to shows on the screen its not a simple or difficult, its look like a guy life aim to create such movie or series in his entire career. the best effort put inside and out come is not best more than this words. every character i loved waiting for season 8 and more curious waiting how to finish the finale season by director judgement.game of thrones i have addicted in young age for this series. ever created the best tv series in the world. 10/10 is very less to this series. i have no other option"
2019-04-18,marc_cab32,Last Two Seasons are comically bad,2,"i can't beleive how much the writing and dialogue has declined over the last few seasons. the banter is comically bad,similar to network tv. disappointing since the show from every aspect, characters, story line and dialogue, was probably the best show ever. terrible."
2017-07-28,haroldareynoldsiv,"Fantasy 'War for Power' Story That's Epic in Scope, But Not Without Its Fair Share of Flaws",10,"i just got finished binge watching seasons 1,6 and am about to start season 7. first off, i'd like to say that the show has some amazing moments and shocks and surprises. the episode ""battle of the bastards"" alone was worth the wait in the same way ""rains of castamere"" was in season 3. in addition, ""the winds of winter"" was also very well done with a scene that was incredible. to anybody who hasn't seen the show, if it wasn't for spoilers in the event they do watch it, i'd recommend watching these 3 episodes alone just as a taste of how good the show can be. however, there are a few criticisms of the show that stand out. the first is that there are way too many characters in the show which can make it convoluted and confusing. even though they are probably trying to stay as faithful to the novel as possible, including all the characters, it really is problematic just how many characters equally share screen time. some of the characters also really look alike, which further complicates the matter. in addition, most of these characters are despicable and have no redeeming qualities, and a few of the characters are not interesting compared to the interesting ones but seem to get similar amounts of screen time. lastly, many of the scenes, especially with the night's watch, a military group, and any scenes in the woods and the snow, in addition to many scenes in the lannister's castle are quite redundant, not just in scenery but also in dialogue. if you had a penny for how many times the words ""king"", ""queen"", or ""brother"", ""sister"" were used you'd be a billionaire (like george rr martin probably is by now).as mentioned in an earlier review i also did of season 1, the fantasy genre must be your ""thing""/cup of tea to really love it. you'll love the best episodes, mentioned above, no matter what, but those are just a few and if you do not have interest in the genre, then the rest of it you will only like, not love. this is because it's total fiction and fantasy so anything realistic is nonexistent if you are someone who prefers that. there is no doubt that danaeryes, her loyalists, and tyrion are the most likable characters and also the most interesting, with the danaeryes being the standout story-line for most of the show. arya and jon snow emerge as likable characters as well, but they begin to stand out more in the latter seasons. if it wasn't for amelia clark's (danaryes targarean) parts, the show would take a major hit for my rating. almost all of her scenes, especially early on, were really what kept me watching. the least interesting parts were early on with the night's watch, and many scenes with peripheral characters, who there is really no reason to care about. this is a blood bath, a gore fest that is predicated on primitive human instincts and material. it's basically one big back stab, pun intended, after another, and as a result it can be dark and disturbing. there is plenty of nudity and sex scenes mixed in that to their credit are usually, at least arguably, placed to drive the narrative forward. battle of the bastards, the winds of winter, rains of castamere, and a few more episodes were great. but if it wasn't for them, the show would be good but fail to achieve greatness. how it ultimately plays out and finishes will determine my final score. unlike some of my favorite shows like ""breaking bad"", i have many episodes rated a 5 or a 6 in the catalogue and found the imdb episode ratings as a whole to be extremely overrated. my actual episode average rating for the show is a mere underwhelming 7.4, but i add some points for the scenery and ambitious scope and effort put into production design. also, this isn't as ""addictive"" or ""binge worthy"" as breaking bad, even though it can definitely be addictive at times and binge worthy. it's a good show with some great episodes that has 1 truly great main character out of dozens (danaeryes targarian) whose ultimate place in the pantheon of great shows has yet to be decided until its final seasons and episodes. but it will definitely be in the conversation.it is slightly overrated on imdb. it's not a 9.5 (well the set design certainly is, but the acting and plot/storyline is about a 7). it should be about a 9.2 on here, but my score is8/10"

2019-06-03,aliholly-62819,Standards need to be raised,10,"i'll make this short and sweet, but hopefully, thought provoking. the world today seems to have really low standards when it comes to entertainment. they want sex, violence, and special effects. while the show has an abundance of all 3 that doesn't mean it's a great, or even good source of entertainment. i'm noticing a pattern with this show and a few others that have come out recently. mainly that, and i want people who have seen it to really think about this: nothing happens. nothing happens, insert a sex scene or 10, then somebody dies in some horrific way and it's supposed to be shocking and keep you engaged. honestly, when i really think about it, it's quite boring.
here's the other major problem i have. the characters. characters in film today are not like they used to be. they're not sympathetic or heroic. they try to make the characters seem that way, but it's known that people today are easy to please, so a character makes a simple little gesture and suddenly that puts them on a pedestal. the lead character, ""our hero"", jon snow, for instance, is so unbelievably boring. he's not a well developed character and he's pretty much just reciting his lines and standing around. the other characters, to put it bluntly, are: meh. with 1 or 2 exceptions, but if or when these characters die, i honestly dont care, which is unfortunate, because i crave characters to love.
the costumes are ok. the ladies dresses look like curtains, but the armor is interesting. the sets are typical medieval stone castle sets, and the scenery is lovely in some spots. the music is good.
ultimately, it's nothing we haven't seen before."

2020-04-08,iamdrumil,A journey that never pays off,1,"game of thrones was an amazing show! the characters are well fleshed out you understand everyone's motives. one character, in particular, jaime lannister he went from being someone you are supposed to hate and someone who is not trustworthy to be one of the most beloved characters you feel sad for him, you want him to succeed, and achieve whatever he wants by the end of the show that's really good character writing. all the other characters also had amazing journeys theon greyjoy for one had a very sad journey and when it comes to sansa stark she was a kid at the beginning of the show and you see her journey to becoming a strong woman. my point is almost all the characters were great!the cgi for dragons was breathtaking it is probably the best cgi dragon i have ever seen. but now let's talk about the issues with the show:one of my biggest complaint with the show is that why did they build,up white walkers for so long (literally for 7 seasons) and then there was no payoff to that it's like they came destroyed a few small villages and a war at winterfell and that's all!? arya stark does all this training which went on for something like 2 seasons was for the most part useless she never used her training what was all that build-up for when you are never going to do anything about it!?tyrion lannister now another character who for no reason all of a sudden became dum in last two season.cersei lannister now another character who was supposed to be an antagonist had no pay-offs in season 8 you get to see her for like one episode! all in all game of thrones sets up amazing ideas for its future instalments but instead in absolutely fails at doing justice to the show and we can a very disappointing season 8 which just feels like it was not worth watching 7 seasons of this show as we literally get no pay-off whatsoever. season 1 to season 7 (9/10) season 8 (4/10)"
2019-04-30,avatarthomas,I love this show!,10,"game of thrones is undoubtedly my favourite show on tv. out of everything i have watched this takes the top spot by a long way! from the brilliant written, shot and choreographed fight scenes. to the tense political aspect! the amazing acting and incredible cast has made this show what it is! i will forever love this show!"

2019-05-14,ted-peterson,What the Hell happened?,10,"final episode:if these producers and their production team is going to take on star wars for disney, expect hope filled promos and absolutely saccharin fulfillment. after jon snow kills off daenerys at the simple behest of tyrion and the dragon burns the evil throne, i had had enough. the dragon took out it's angst by burning a chair? pleeeeeease! these writers and producers should be fined and jailed for misappropriation of creativity under the guise of story telling. jrr must be fuming as are all who followed what turned out to be a mass of misdirection, bad writing and sophomoric plot lines that mostly went nowhere.here are a couple of glaring examples: arya stark is on a mission to kill the queen. plot line forgotten. jon snow is really a targarian. plot line forgotten. bram, who can't be a ruler because he's the 3,eyed crow and can see everything, suddenly becomes the ruler because he can't have kids? plot line forgotten and twisted to get an ending that didn't lead people to expect anything more. there are other starks but sansa is queen of the north? horrible outcome. arya goes on an adventure to the west just because no one has ever gone there before? in westros, the world must be as flat as the flat-earther's say it is because one would suspect she's going to fall off the edge. what happened to the citadel? they were the only guys to get it right: they had been there for thousands of years and had survived the ice walkers before. why would samwell ever think the world would end if they didn't do something? indeed, the ice walkers went down rather easily at the hands of a young girl who had a great character stripped from her by absolutely stupid, egotistical producers and writers who were looking to get out of this thing while leaving the prospects for spin-offs. what a colossal joke on what could have been a real theatrical and artistic statement.the show ends with jon going off with the wildlings who he had befriended and saved for the most part, from the ice walkers. here's how the show should have ended:sansa stark heads north with soldiers she brought. arya killed daenarys and is exiled so she is sent to the west where supposedly boogy-men and monsters exist. jon goes back to the wreck of ft. black, discovers it's a total mess and heads off with the wildlings.then tyrion and the others sit down at a boring meeting and try to figure out how to rebuild kings landing and manage crops, what's left of the military and how to run the day-in-day-out operations of a large society of people interdependent on each other. somebody is going to have to clean up and get rid of all the bodies and restore a semblance of sanity so people can repopulate. food has to come from somewhere and it's important to get those brothels going again. that would have been fitting. forty-five minutes of a tedious business meeting to cap off two seasons where no creativity took place and where producers and writers were so out of their league that a 13-year old middle school student could have done better.i'm going to take a segue here to the battle with the ice walkers. here is the beginning of the battle. daenarys has allowed the dothraki (sp) to be in the front lines. they are going to charge at the army of the dead estimated to be some 500k strong. nobody thinks to have any kind of strategy. they rush off into battle with creatures who can't be killed and if they get killed themselves, come back as soldiers in the dead army. so let them rush headlong into the fight as if this is going to accomplish the ultimate goal of getting the ice walker king in front of bram who is bait that the ice walker king can't resist because he touched him once?the only thing affirmed by this battle and many of the others fought was the absolute superiority of air power agains light infantry of any kind. overall, whoever stages those battles should be fined for misrepresentation of skill.penultimate episode:i don't have any idea what the writers and producers were thinking. it must have been something like this: ""hey, we've made a lot of money so far so let's pull the plug on any creative idea or concept of conflict resolution, pocket our cash and get out of dodge before the stupid audience figures out that we are totally ripping them off.somehow, the creative side of this series managed to take a compelling story with some minor episodic flaws that left me groaning and turned the series into a woman's year memorial into how insipid are men around powerful women.this series has turned into a colossal joke and parody of itself. one striking moment had brothers fighting it out similar to the light saber scenes from ""revenge of the sith.""they somehow managed to turn one of the more compelling female roles, that of arya stark into a weak screaming little girl faced with her own mortality. gone is the revenge-seeking heroine who slayed the ice walker king and walter frey and all his kind and survived the ego-bruising initiation into the so-called ""league"" of assassins and who survived endless situations that would have driven most people mad, like loosing her sight and the beheading of her own father. now we find that the creative non-geniuses in charge of character development have managed to stick her into the devolvement machine from ""mario bros."" and eliminate all her life experience and reduce her to a sniveling little girl running for her life. it's not only bad conceptually but insulting.forget that there is not one whit of military strategy that could win any battle and people survive in situations they shouldn't. jaime should have died several times and dead come back to life in westros but that's episodic tv. it's medieval ""supernatural"" in the foolish plot contrivances. but that can be forgiven.what can't be forgiven is turning a good, compelling story into a ""dungeons and dragons"" remake without the humor of the original. i watched with some degree of expectation that the developers of such characters as samwell and the lanisters could resolve the potential final battles with some degree of sophistication. but, alas, they didn't and they have played a colossal joke on a pretty devoted audience.i rate this five starts because before these last two seasons, a pretty good story was unfolding and that kept me and a lot of people watching. all i can ask is: ""what the hell happened?"""

2011-05-10,zetomes,"Soul of Shakespeare, soul of what acting represents",1,"i knew nothing about this series, neither literature nor this screen adaptation, nor even the author's work and name. this discovery was perfectly casual if it wasn't by my sceptical analysis of recent conan's adaptation. we discussed john millus' conan, robert e. howard's and ""savage sword of conan"", summoning the souls that should be transposed to the big screen. it was mentioned the plastic and orgasmic status hollywood had presently acquired from the past few decades since its lack of profoundness, lack of critical approach, exuberance of ephemeral sensational effects and deeply poor acting had become its rooted motto of making money by exclusive brief debuts and marketing. the audience is attracted to a blockbuster movie like a donkey is to a carrot, exactly what i was expecting and confirmed later to be the new ""conan"". someone suggested this series in contrast to the cheesy updated blockbuster. this introduction reminds me that i found everything i was searching for not in the new ""conan"" adaptation but here, in ""game of thrones"" , the art of narrative, the real acting and the incredible immersion in a fictionalized world where ancient archetypes and human spirit, plots, dilemmas, are all present. for my surprise i had my fingers fondling my beard, synonymous of intensely tasting what i was seeing while following the pilot episode, cursing slang with excellency attributions.tolkien was always a reference since i remember, directly or unconsciously in my fictional world and i always felt that good adaptations of big tomes couldn't arise from spectacular blockbusters nor compressed movies - its juice would be simply wasted. lord of the rings was average but it wouldn't be that juicy if some few excellent actors and some very good special effects weren't present.but what can i say more? shakespeare, tolkien, literature, very wise application of special effects, excellent plot and acting, bold posture of using nudity naturally, bold posture of having a ""dwarf"" as main character (my favorite by the way) breaking bounds of politically correct, excellent costumes and characterization, what can i say more? i found everything here and like a kid i'm anxious to see the next episode (updated:season) already attached to the characters and this complex unpredictable and political world.congratulations to george r. r. martin the composer, to david benioff and d.b. weiss the marvelous interpreters and congratulations to the bold hbo that allowed it to be materialized as also as to every mastered craftsman making it possible."
2019-12-16,krikkedominick13,I loved it until the battle for winterfell,10,"at first i thought this show was amazing, even so that i descided to do everything westeros related, but after the end of season 7 i began to doubt the series, turned out at the ending of season 8 to be a dissappointment, they shouldve stopped with the battle for winterfell or at least stick to that telling, the last episodes of the series were unnecessary and made no sense most of the running. also i knew it from the very first episode that what happend, happend."

2019-05-24,raycharles81,"Always Was a Little Overrated, But Still One of the Top 5 Series of All Time, Here's Why",9,"1) cinematic, multimillion dollar special effects, cgi, set design, production valuesthe visual effects for a tv show are absolutely phenomenal. usually, you will experience them with the dragons and along the primary female protagonist, daenerys targaryan's journey, or in the truly epic battle scenes that can hold their own with the best modern movies that have battlefield scenes.2) maise williams, as the series goes on, she becomes the standout ""star"" of the show. it is both unexpected and ironic to watch her develop as just a side character into a movie star. not sure which direction her career will go after this, or if parts like this will ever emerge again, but it's hard not to fall in love with her character and story.3) daenerys targaryan- similarly to maise's arya, emilia clarke's danaerys' journey from oppressed teenager sold into marriage to a barbarian to discovering her dragon power and then realizing her potential as a freer of slaves, breaker of chains, and heroine as she battles villains, backstabbers, and enemies while making friends and raising her dragons in hopes to rule the iron throne is imo the best storyline in the show, about tied with arya's. dany's story is an adventure through the eastern hemisphere of westeros as she gains wisdom and worldliness from her intuition and advisors, with the primary advisor being mormont.4) battle scenes and shocking twists combined. the famous battle scenes and shocking twists are worth the watch alone, even if they are viewed independently. they would give any newcomer to the show an idea of why the show is so famous and would probably entice them to give it a watch. of course, for context, the show should be viewed from the beginning, but these are must sees for all movie or television fans.5) competent and above average writing and acting for a tv series throughout. it's not on breaking bad's level of writing, but it has its moments and is almost up there, and the acting as a whole is above average for television.overall, game of thrones is an excellent television show. it ultimately received lots of criticism for its 8th season, but it wasn't all bad, just disappointing. the show is still better than other popular shows of the decade or two, shows like dexter, walking dead, mad men, sons of anarchy, and the wire. it is in a genre of its own (fantasy/war/adventure) so it is hard to compare with the great dramas. it is the best show of its genre and just below breaking bad on the list. they are the two best shows of their genres.the primary issues with the show arose in the final 2 seasons, and yes, at times it really was ""that"" bad and criticism was warranted. from heavy cheesy dialogue to laughable plot armor to butchering character arcs and storylines by ignoring all that preceded the information given for six to seven seasons before it, to diminishing the scenes time and lines of the show's best villains and characters, to arguably making a parody of the ending, to an abundance of illogical and nonsensical story events, and at critical times coming off as like a bad soap opera written by teenagers.8/10"

2017-06-23,lneil-51-106502,Destined to be one of television's legendary greats,4,"with six full seasons gone and the seventh about to start, i can finally put to rest any concerns that this series could not do justice to a series of novels that boast incredibly complex, interwoven plot,lines, deep and complete character development over long periods, and a fantasy/medieval setting of amazing detail and imagination.an avid reader of fiction my whole life, i have always expected to have to suffer compromise in detail, accuracy and completeness when translating the written story to the screen. this series, however, brings the novels to the viewer with an unprecedented (to my knowledge) accuracy, completeness and precision. the most telling indicator of this is that each scene actually looks familiar on first sight, as it is so true to the reader's imaginings (mine, anyway) from the descriptive passages in martin's books.a special treat for both viewers and readers is the concept of a more realistic story-world, where the good guys seldom win and the finest characterisations are most often those of the darker, more evil souls in the saga. when the 'good guys' do secure some measure of victory then, it is all the more satisfying, as outcomes can almost never be reliably predicted.the entire saga is so full of plot twists, surprise events and unexpected character development that i never found a single episode to be less than completely engaging; even enthralling. no doubt this is due in large measure to george r. r. martin's involvement in the entire production.regardless of whether you are usually a fan of whatever genre you perceive this to fit into, if you appreciate absolute quality in television production, you must watch this show!"
2019-05-21,lorraineesimpson,Loved it but why the rush ....,9,"i was a very latecomer to game of thrones and watched seasons 1 , 7 in the three weeks before season 8 started. the advantage of that was that everything was fresh in my mind. however, that also proved a disadvantage in that i clearly remembered stuff that didn't quite work out the way it was suggested in the earlier episodes. another disadvantage of this cramming was being able to see quite clearly that season 8 was very rushed - clearly the writers were in a tearing hurry to get this tied up, and that's a real shame because what was sacrificed was proper plot development. the very thing that made the first few seasons so good was the time and care taken to develop characters fully. much as i enjoyed it season 8 was not nearly as satisfying as it could have been because so much was skipped over.despite the above i'm not one of those who hated the conclusion. yes there was stuff in the final episode that didn't make much sense. wouldn't grey worm have just killed jon snow (and probably tyrion too) on the spot for murdering his queen? the wall, all but destroyed by a zombie dragon and white walkers in an earlier episode is miraculously returned to its pristine self in the blink of an eye. the game of thrones is finally won by the spookily annoying bran, but there again he had to have some purpose in season 8 and really, apart from sansa, there were no other serious contenders. jon had descended into being a spineless sap, only redeeming himself slightly by putting an end to the nutty daenerys. both jon and daenerys' characters suffered badly i thought through the rush to bring the story to a conclusion. their relationship was never believable anyway because not enough time was spent on developing it, but also daenerys' morphing into the mad queen seemed to happen in an instant.but there were also some great moments in the final episode. i loved the scene where drogon emerges from the snow and ash to inspect jon. brienne writing jamie's epitaph in the book was a poignant moment and of course tyrion weeping for his dead siblings demonstrated yet again what a fine actor peter dinklage is. i could see at least 3 spin-offs emerging from the final episode. the travels of arya, the reign of sansa, queen of the north and the continuiing story of jon snow and the wildlings.all good things come to an end unfortunately and, despite the shortcomings of the final season i still give game of thrones a 10 because it's been truly epic. i loved it and will miss it terribly but i suspect we haven't really seen the last of it."
2012-02-24,lamitch,Perhaps the best TV series of 2011,9,"i am writing this as i am re,watching the first season on demand in preparation for the april 1 premier of the second season. currently the original series is rated at 9.4 stars with 94,807 votes; i don't recall ever seeing a show rated so high, and with so many votes. this was a fantastic production, and i'm looking forward to the next installment.i originally watched the series when it first aired. i had not read the books, and to be honest, didn't exactly know what i was getting into. i had thought it was set in medieval britain, but i quickly realized the story is set in the mythical land of westeros. this mythical setting allowed mr. martin the flexibility to write a fantastic tale of human lives, with love, hate, honor, betrayal, sex, lust, war, and other struggles that would have been something less had it been set on earth. i did download an app for my ipad that was called the got companion, and this provided me much of the back-story that was not explained in the series. i thought the production was so good that i purchased the books once the series ended.it seems most of the low ratings and poor reviews disliked the show because of the sex and violence. i find this humorous for a few reasons, the first being that the show is clearly rated ac, al, n, v (aka: adult content, adult language, nudity, violence). they show the ratings at the beginning of the program so that children, young and old, will not have their delicate sensibilities infringed upon. secondly, the story is set in another time, on another world, with other gods and religions; from what we've seen so far, it appears that their gods and religions are not obsessed with human sexual practices, unlike several of our earthy religions. that seems like a highly civilized concept if you ask me."

2020-12-07,peacedisturber,After the final season this show should be NOWHERE Near Breaking Bad,1,"as you can see in the title, i am of the opinion that more people ought to stop being nostalgic about the older seasons. they were between 9,10 for sure. but starting with the beyond the wall episode in season 7, there is absolutely no way you could give it anything better than a 7. and given that the final season was almost predominantly a 3-4/10 rating quality of writing....yeah, this does not deserve an overall score of anything higher than 8.5 now. don't disrespect shows that actually were good from start to finish by putting this one up there. it's such bs."
2012-05-04,arginnon,Season 1,10,"i can say, that game of thrones is the best tv show i ever watched. better than, house, heroes, 24 or even dexter. although, i have to admit, that by the first episode i wasn't really fond of the show, it even annoyed me little, because i expected it more to be like lord of the rings. if you want to watch the series because you liked sean bean in peter jackson's trilogy, then game of thrones will be disappointing for you. it is something entirely different, and although it is, as well, in the fantasy genre, its style can not be compared to the lord of the rings. it's much darker, bloodier, has a lot more swearing and nudity. so, if you expect to see some fun adventure like the movie trilogy stated above, avoid this show. because, i have to say, i hated the first episode, because it disappointed me so much. i ceased watching the show even, but when i learned it was nominated for golden globe, i thought i'd give it a second chance. and i'm glad i did.the story is good, the actors are fantastic, the intro and theme music are amazing and the art direction and costume designs are also masterful. my favorites in the show were tyrion lannister (the amazing peter dinklage), eddard stark (the always great sean bean) and daenerys targarien (the fantastic emilia clarke). the two people i literally loathed were cersei lannister (lena headey whom i don't really like) and her annoying little brat, joffrey baratheon (played by jack gleeson, that kid with the annoying face from batman begins). mark addy was very funny, also aidan gillen and kit harington did very good jobs as well.i didn't read the book, but i liked the story and the drama very much. it was interesting to see a fantasy more about politics and the relationship of people, than the actual adventure. i would've liked more action though, i hated when they faded out of a whole battle scene just because tyrion fell unconscious, but that's maybe because that's how it was done in the book or the creators didn't have enough money or time. anyway, it's a great show, but it needs a bit more of fighting and battle. and a little less nudity wouldn't go amiss either. i don't see the need for it, so why show cocks and tits in every episode? if i wanted to see that, i'd go watch porn. maybe the director was just horny."
2020-09-19,anton_carlsson,A great series that fall on finish line (no spoilers),1,a great series. all people involved gives a 110%. but there is a problem.when they ran out of book material the series quality decreased. the last episodes really beefed it and soured the overall experience. it's a real shame.
2017-08-13,semmy-tones,"A Dangerous Show Promoting Violence, Rape and Amorality as the Norm and then Downloading it into Viewers Minds as Acceptable",2,"whilst the story line induces compulsive viewing, the content and pitch leave much to be desired. what with women being treated like pieces of meat with no value other than breeding or pleasure; babies being slaughtered and fed to monsters, murdering and burning young children; dismembering people on all scales including genitally; stabbing pregnant women; incest between fathers and daughters and brothers and sisters; dirty old men bedding girls young enough to be their grandchildren; sadism, torture, murder, cruelty with a marked lack of compassion, mercy or any other redeeming factors, it's a wonder that this show is so popular. so it must be assumed that people are just addicted to pain, suffering and violence.the problem with shows like this is that they set a terrible example that downloads into viewers subconscious minds and is then digested on a deep level only to pop out of someone later in 'real life' it has been known to happen. sp, whilst the production is lavish, there are no positive features in terms of message; few heroic acts that often end with the heroes being murdered and the only motivation of the characters is lust, greed and power. tv is dangerously influential and should be handled with care. this is a celebration of everything abhorrent about the human condition and is being used as entertainment. whilst lotr demonstrated elegance, beauty, magic, love and heroism as well as flawless production and direction, this is junk food made with the specific purpose of lowering your vibration and has come from from the gutters of deeply disturbed minds who are now in control of the industry. there is no doubt an addictive quality to it but it's far too repellent to be tolerated on a long term basis. after a while the violence gets repulsive because it does not offer anything good, uplifting or positive. it's actually disturbing that it is so popular. i wouldn't be surprised if there were subliminal messages worked in to get people hooked. either that or human thirst for pain has sadly become the norm. but then, that's what brainwashing is all about!"
2015-06-15,dumaal,Possibly the worst storyline I will ever encounter...,5,"i must say that the realization of this series is astonishing. acting is great, image is great, music is great. the story on the other hand is worst trash. nobody knows how it will end, but i can tell you, ...unfortunately. it will have no particular meaningful end. everybody will be killed or die in some disturbing way, and at the end you will not remember how and why it all started, which is actually true for the last few seasons even now. the whole world desperately awaits for a meaning but there will never be one. whenever the story will end, it could have ended equally well after the 1st season. even in chinese movies the tragedy has some deepness, there is honor, sacrifice, values, and death has purpose, in this one if something resembles to anything, one can be certain it is just a vessel for surprising the viewer with another unexpected random death. a pattern emerged and after 5 seasons any hope for a decent story is long dead. the worst part is millions of people are disturbed by the story but they keep looking for the hope it will get better. it never will. when people wait starts to obviously become annoying the author just kills the main character, does not matter how, and this way makes the story unexpected, again. it is so dumb when you actually think of it, that no one put that before on paper, with success at least. you will probably continue to watch, and only the end will show you what an incredible waste of time this tv series was."
2019-07-30,arnab-18513,From gold to tin in a matter of one season,10,"got had the potential to be a jem among jewels in the series fraternity. from season 1 to 6 and almost to 7 omg.......sheer awesomeness, but whatever happened after that was just murdering. i personally think the series was somewhat sabotaged because in this world nothing is perfect and neither should a series be. season 8 was a disaster to say the least. i would say got needed 10 season to wrap up the full storyline."

season 1 , 9.5/10
season 2 - 9.5/10
season 3 - 10/10
season 4 - 10/10
season 5 - 7/10 (hardhome saved this season)

season 8 - 3/10"
2019-05-01,snkkylo,Great to Worse,8,"got isn't same anymore since the finale of season 6, too much fan,service nowadays, ruined tyrion, varys, and killed off littlefinger, and don't get me started on butchering of night king/walkers stroryline (storyline they've been building up for years). almost every fan-favorite characters are plot armoured. characters are teleporting here to there. there isn't any tension nor shock events like in starting seasons. i felt like i'm watching some random superhero movie.
they've hyped bow as it would be more shocking than red wedding. someone tell them that there's difference between creating shock events with writting brilliance and create forced shock events just to satisfy masses without caring about plots.

2013-04-12,trajanc,"Beautiful, well acted and ridiculous.",10,"game of thrones does for medieval fantasy what deadwood did for westerns. and like deadwood game of thrones amps up the viciousness but this time to a ridiculous degree. the acting is terrific. the set design (cgi or not), costumes, directing, editing and sound are all top notch. the dialogue can be cutting and clever but also arch and melodramatic. the desperate and menacing and oh so important conversations frankly started to blur together in my head. just when your attention might wander breasts or a new extreme in atrocities is served to remind you how cool and hardcore this world is. after a while i started to wonder how anyone is still alive in this world. where does all this fodder come from? but for sure thousands of lives will be readily available for extinguishing next time the audience might be getting bored or needs to be reminded how nasty somebody is."

game of thrones is one of those shows that ran out of steam, each season seamed to lose a bit in the end product, script and acting seamed to be forced rather than in the first few seasons it looked and felt the acting and production of the show seamed effortless.
the last season was a complete failure it was rushed and well below standards of the previous seasons."
2019-06-19,inker-13614,Wow,10,"i am one of those people who has never seen game of thrones, but i have heard a lot about it and most of my friends really like it. so i decided that i will give it a shot out of curiosity. actually before i thought that i will not start to watch it unless i am sure i have enough free time, because i´ve heard the series can be quite addictive.so i got through the 1st season and a couple of episodes from the 2nd season. maybe it gets better from there, i don´t know yet, but for now i am overly baffled as to how utterly bad this has been. i cannot wrap my head around the rave about this show, about all the hype, all the excitement. i just don´t get it. and i must say i am no rookie with series or movies , i have seen and reviewed a lot of good material. maybe the thing is that i am not super into this genre or this type of history that is displayed in the game of thrones... but then again i feel like i would´ve enjoyed it if it would´ve been better.so what was so bad about it in my opinion? the script, the storylines - so-so vague and pointless, jumpy and unlogical. so i got the feeling that it is not the most important thing about the show. and i´ll add that i haven´t read the books either to really know the true content of the whole story.
the actors - well...they´re kind of okay, but when they killed off sean bean i thought okay, so nothing and no-one interesting to watch anymore. yes, king joffrey is kind of creepy, but i am not sure if its because of good acting or because the actor has a very specific suitable look for the part. but then again, maybe in other seasons there will be/are some better characters.
everything else - i mean the gory scenes seem pointless most of the time and seems like they want to make you want to watch the show because of very cheap shock value. got me thinking ""do i need to be sicker somehow to enjoy this?"" again i thought well maybe they just started the series off that way, to get people to engage and talk about it etc. i hope that´s the case...so as of now i´ll give this show 2 points out of 10 and we´ll see if i feel like watching it some more and if i will like it more. one point is for sean bean and the second point is for being able to surprise me with how bad it all was."
2019-05-10,twittkamp,Season 8 drags it down.,10,"i had the rating at 9 originally. this was one of the best shows on television. unexpected twist that surprised me, but still made total sense in,universe, had me on my toes. a total lack of plot armor made me fear for my favorite characters like no other show or movie had for a very long time. the politics, the intrigues, the whole story had me in its grip.then season 8 happened. from no plot armor, the show went to 110% plot armor. the politics are suddenly laughably bad and simple. characters are propped up while others are torn down for what i can only speculate are the writers injecting hollywood politics into the show. nothing against strong female characters, some of my favorite movies have female leads, but when it is so obvious that there's an agenda at play, like it is in got towards the end, it's just off-putting.the writing was deteriorating since the show overtook the books, but season 8 is bafflingly bad. there's still a few episodes to go, but after episode 3 and 4 i've lost all hope and will stop watching the show alltogether.such a promising show that ends on such a low note is a shame. got has lost all rewatchability and i will probably never watch another episode of this show again and neither will i recommend it to anyone.i've changed my rating from 9 to 5 because the first 4 to 5 seasons are still superb. but the underwhelming and badly written conclusion destroys everything good about the show that came before. a real shame and a lost opportunity. the writers should feel bad and ashamed."

2021-03-01,bigideas_baggins,It's sad to give this rating,10,"why did i give this rating then? well, let's start with why not , i.e. addressing some of the, as you might call it, straw men that are posed against negative reviews. whilst there will certainly be negative reviews the following apply to, for me the reason is different.""you did not get the story you wanted (that you thought up as fan theory)"". well, i did not really have a fan theory, so i was pretty much ready to accept anything well written.""you cannot stand to see your favorite characters die"". nope, no problem with that, when done well. like with ned and robb stark in the earlier seasons.""you are a book purist and cannot accept deviation from the books"". nope, i have not even read all the books. even if i had, it's an adaptation so changes are almost always necessary.""the show is subverting expectations and you cannot deal with that"". ah, subverting expectations, the great trope of the 2010's. again, no problem with that in principle - ned and robb were also examples of subverting expectations. it's all about writing it well.""why watch this if you think it sucks?"". well, it did not always suck, as the first few seasons were great. if it had sucked from the beginning, yes, i probably would not have watched it.so what is my reason then? simple: bad writing. as in, generally speaking the writing got worse and worse as the source material ran out. this is of course not a shocking revelation, at this point it's well documented across the internet. it turns out d&d are rather good at adapting books into tv episodes, including adding some nice touches here and there (like the tywin/arya scenes). but they are not as capable when it comes to writing a story themselves. worse, knowing this, they seem to be too proud to call in people to help them write a decent story, but instead decided to rush this thing to a finish line. so the result is a tv show that is great in terms of cgi, costumes, settings, music, acting (mostly) etc. throughout its run, and great in terms of writing for roughly the first four seasons. after that, it still looks the same, but starts to make less and less sense. this can be difficult to notice at first, because the change is gradual, and the ""writers"" start inserting more and more shocking moments to try and keep you invested, and thus camouflage the decline in story quality. to most this became pretty obvious by the time of season 8, though if you look back it starts much earlier: for example, season 5 has the dorne plot and the beginning of the end for tyrion's character.examples of bad writing can range from the big - completely throwing away character arcs (jaime - from redemption revealing his actual motivations to a casual ""not caring about the innocent"") or consistency (sansa - no way of knowing how she will behave from scene to scene) to the small (teleporting people and armies, positioning ballista's in front of the line outside the walls, king's landing suddenly being in the desert (when ""winter is coming""), dany ""kinda forgetting"" about the iron fleet when mentioning them a scene earlier, etc.). i will not go through all of the examples, but let's just say there is enough.this also means - just to be clear - that i put almost all of the blame with d&d, where it belongs, in my opinion. so when others, like many of the actors, come out with angry responses to the fans (because of the fans' angry responses to the show), i'm like: yeah, but we (i) are not angry with you. nikolai, kit, emilia, conleth, peter, etc. - you all did a wonderful job. too bad there were also two guys that did not.game of thrones is often ranked as one of the best tv shows of all time, up there with breaking bad, the sopranos, and what not. and it could have been. believe me, i really wanted it to have been that. i have no desire to give a low rating out of spite, just to lower the average and only because of a few nitpicks. but in the end, the show is just bad, ruined by the extremely poor writing in the later seasons, which also severely hurts the earlier seasons because they can hardly stand on their own without taking into account how it all ended up."
2021-10-23,endalayng,Revisited,7,"i have just watched season 8 again, not since the show's originally aired. was very disappointed.having watched again , i believe the criticism was ott. not the ending we wanted but was a lot better than we thought. it wasn't your typical tv ending .and what we expected. but, , in,spite of the flaws it's still better than the hordes believe. we expected too much."

2019-12-17,mattlewisnati,The rest doesn't matter anymore,10,the ending we were given drains the life out of all the build up. unacceptable. completely lost for words.
2017-01-01,mnsmb7,What else can be said?,3,"this show has dominated the spring of my life for the last 6 years and each and every season has been well worth the wait. this is the greatest show of all time and the only show that might rival it would be band of brothers or breaking bad. the book being brought to life in front of us with stunning scenery, brilliant writing and out,of-this- world acting. grr martin is one messed up dude but has created a masterpiece. the brilliance in the show is the individual dialogues that take place watching the true greed of man take place in the south while everyone seems to be completely forgetting about what is north of the wall. i would recommend this show to anyone with a heart that can handle extreme drama, in-depth characters and possibly the greatest on television acting performance from peter dinklage. this show truly has my vote for the greatest television show of all time and the main reason people can't get into the show is that they lack the patients or attention span to focus on the show. you do actually need to watch the show to know what is going on. 10/10"
2019-06-03,putnamdavis,Great follower of books,10,incredible story and show reflects the story very well. most impressive are the actors who captured the characters splendidly.
2021-07-30,alexandermalic,One of the best shows ever!,10,i'm binge rewatching it and the show is still perfect.
2019-06-15,dgcampo,The Experts need to get over this!,10,"i binge watched the entire series over three weeks and never heard of the franchise before; so that's my perspective. there are bound to be some loose ends when you are finishing up a show and the novels on which the show are based are not even finished. the plot line was solid; and although even i could tell when the show was deviating from the books. nevertheless, i thought it was well written and well acted (mr. dinklage deserved all three emmys, and i think he should dust off a place for his fourth). as for the critics; i'm sorry it didn't turn out the way you want, but from an objective perspective this was well done."
2011-04-26,skullbussa,"Bad pacing, spotty writing and acting - but still watchable",10,"fresh from finishing the first book in the series, i was anxious to catch the first two episodes of this series. it's absurd to expect a film to ever deliver the kind of rich experience a good book does but i still found myself let,down by some of the decisions made by this production.the film does look good, the actors look their parts. i cannot fault the picture for the way it makes do with a limited budget. yet i found myself rolling my eyes at the clearly caucasian actor who, besmeared with tanner and eye makeup, is made to be khal drogo. it reminds me of john wayne westerns where the ""indians"" were simply random white actors who were covered in shoe polish.which brings me to my next complaint - there is just too much daenerys in these opening episodes. she is a very important character but the way in which she has nearly equal screen time to the starks ruins her character arch and i wonder what will be left for her to do at the end of this first season.the worst offense of these two episodes is, as many others have pointed out, the terrible scene where bran is thrown to his doom. this scene is accompanied by light-hearted music and the way the scene is portrayed smacks of a daytime soap opera; the lannisters even look the part here.i understand that hbo enjoys pushing the sexual envelope and i am no enemy of seeing a beautiful naked woman, but it just seems that the sex and nudity are exploitative in this film. the book had a lot of it, but it used it less frequently so that it would have more effect.overrall the films do not seem like they're in expert hands. the acting can sometimes be splendid and other times i am shocked that a scene was spared the editor's mouseclick...there is just very little consistency. each scene soars or falls flat in alternating order and after a while this just becomes a little tiring."
2020-04-22,esplund,Vastly overrated!!!,10,fans have vastly overrated this series! most of these fans aren't true medieval fantasy aficionados. the writing wasn't very good. it had a big budget with a great cast. if your a true fan of medieval fantasy you know what i'm talking about.
2020-09-08,akshayjv-05222,Best web series ever made,10,"there is no dought that game of thrones is the best web series ever made. you need patience for watching got. it starts with a slow phase but the story and charectors buildes it's momentem by passing each season. got doesn't concentrate to a single character it concentrates through numerous charectors. the other important factor is the vfx .the dragons ,wars , palaces everything about got fells real . they created a whole new world. this makes it as the most expensive web series ever. please watch it , i can't describe game of thrones few sentences."
2020-12-27,aloysius_predato,GOAT until the last two episodes.,10,"it seems to me, that once they surpassed martin's novels, the show started going downhill and this descent culminated with the last two episodes plopping right into the toilet with no redeeming value. they were ridiculous, and they even took a year off to supposedly ""get it right."" the ending was an insult to the legions of loyal fans.if you're one of the few who haven't experienced this yet, it's definitely worth watching. perhaps i will have even helped to set your expectations for the finale so low that it might not be that bad for you.i don't have high hopes for the prequel, as it seems like they're intent on falling in line and making it an extended social justice infomercial."
2019-05-20,cherchezan,Such an amazing ride just to fail so hard at the end,1,"i gave it a 10 star rating all the way to the end. i chaged it to a 7 today instead of a 4 since most of the show was a pretty amazing ride, however the last season, while pretty good overall, had the worst ending imaginable. jesus christ, what a waste... this show was close to perfection almost all the way to the end.. yet such a bad ending..."
2011-06-20,imvaughn,Great Series,1,"great great series. what makes this series so great is that you never know what will happen. in some series/movies you know xxx is the good guy and they will never die. they will always win. it takes out the suspense. instead of wondering if your guy will win, you just watch to see how they will when. in the gow everything goes. no one is safe or secure. it is one of the first series where no one ( except those who have read the books) knows what will happen. for example, we have ed stark at the beginning. he is the guy featured on the posters. he is the king's hand. at the end of the 1st season, he dies. now there will be those who are disappointed, but for me i thought it was a perfect ending. jeffery, the king's son, didn't know he was a bastard and what stark said was treason. it shocked the audience and made me extremely happy. i have read the wiki for the next book and let me say... stay tuned!! there is nothing but surprises and twist ahead!! i am loving this series and sad i have to wait for season 2."
2012-05-01,tkdlion8,"50% Lord of the Rings, 50% Spartacus Blood and Sand, & 100% awesome",10,"finally someone has done it. at last there is a book to screen adaptation that is satisfying for those who have read the book. i actually find some of the characters more engaging than i did when i read the novels. robb is a good example of this.do you like fantasy with: sword,fighting, dragons, magic, politics, good acting, & good writing? if you said yes then watch this as soon as possible. of course i should mention that this series is not for children. if you have read the books you know what i am talking about.the production design is great it is great to see places like the wall realized on screen. quarth is quite nice as well.i am quite pleased with the direwolves as well. i was a little worried about how they were going to turn out but they look amazing in the second season."
2019-05-20,phil-k-664-368870,"Night King, White Walkers and Dragons",6,"it was pretty much half way through season 7 when i started watching game of thrones. i binge watched from season 1 and by the time i hade finished season 7 the season had finished a few months before and i had to wait a while for the final season but not as long as those who had watched it at the time it was broadcast.so it was all still reasonable fresh for me at this point, i had struggled with early seasons, it seemed to drag and was filled with nudity, sex scenes and even some keep it in the family to try and keep peoples interest. we got to know some characters as they developed through the early seasons and then they were killed off.the main characters shone through and stayed with us, the pace and story picked up and by the time the white walkers arrived...(after hearing people talk about the white walkers, that is the time i decided to watch)...i was then hooked. however at the end of season 7 had us wondering who had survived the attack on the wall.season 8 had everyone safe and well in a castle...what a total anti,climax. even though these episodes were long it still all seemed rushed, then came the big battle...and what a battle it was...the longest battle ever seen on the small and big screen. people moaned about the episode like they expected a psychological thriller with lots of chit chat, we all knew it was coming shesssh.about that battle, it was indeed epic, if you could see it through the darkness, i set the brightness to full so the months of filming wasn't wasted and i could see again but then they brought in the fog like they didn't want us to see and we saw glimpses of why as the cgi was not the 10 million dollars worth they claimed to have spent on it. that said it was epic and worth the watch.the next episode was a famous one...for the coffee cup. :d the penultimate episode pretty much made up our minds who we wanted to sit on the iron throne. those who voted this 5 or below are trolls, they try to stand out and buck the trend but end up looking stupid. however this is far from a 10 too.just to end i enjoyed the series, especially the white walkers, the night king and the mighty dragons. maybe the ending wasn't one we chose or wanted but then again if it was it would be condemned for being predictable. i liked the twist and i wont loose any sleep over it.p.s hope the spin off revolves around the night king and the white walkers.7/10"
2019-04-12,katiebugg-49971,BEST SHOW EVER!!!! Off the charts!!!,1,"dragons, kings, queens, love, fighting, magic, zombies, plot twists, what else could you possibly ask for??? literally the best show i've ever seen!!!!! the mother of dragons is the best part of every single episode, oh, and john snow of course! i would love to live in a world where they ruled our 'kingdom'. lol. the visuals are amazing, the acting is breathtaking, the stories are incredible. nothing negative to say whatsoever....and i usually am not a fan of magical, time period movies and shows with dragons and kingdoms. but game of thrones is truly remarkable!!!! it's like nothing else i've ever watched... and i've watched a lot. a must see!!!!!"
2019-06-03,riffat-87805,Epic; but...,10,"usually, we can enjoy with high one or two actor's performance in any dramatic work; but in this particular epic dramatic work, we can enjoy with more than a dozen significant characters with high performance, although most of those actors are almost unknown. significant director; significant cinematography, significant photography, significant production, even significant costume design, and significant makeup. but there are serious defects regards building the personalities and creation of the events. there are too many of illogical and unjustified changing and alteration in the behavior of the personalities during the course of the events of this series of this work!!! there are too many of illogical and unjustified changing and alteration of the events; too many unanswered questions and open,ended events. if i may ask a question: is the writers of this epic work are the only weakness in this work?? maybe the writers didn't respect the cleverness of the viewers?? or maybe the writers simply couldn't control such huge events!!!"
2019-05-22,muvbuff-45737,An amazing series,6,"save for season 8, this series is one of the best ever to be on television. watch seasons 1,7 and ignore 8 if you want, but i won't be penalizing the entire show for one bad season. i still love the show and think its up there with breaking bad, the sopranos, and deadwood as all time great shows."
2017-10-24,petragreen,Mind blowing and best show on TV right now,10,"lately when it comes to tv shows a lot of shows have started off great but end up going down hill after a few seasons. however game of thrones isn't one of them. it does have some slow paced episodes and slow build up but it's still worth watching. the action, shock value and violence is mind blowing. the dark tone, locations, costumes cgi and make up effects for the white walkers are visually amazing. casting choice for characters is great. not only is this probably one of the best tv shows but one of the best medieval dramas. it deserves the high praise and rating it has. just wish other tv shows i watch could be as great, clever and enjoyable as game of thrones."
2020-07-02,1mr-bee,Totally ruined by the last series.,5,i can't even watch it a second time around. it now looks so bad to me that it's not worth the effort to review. truly upsetting that the last series was completely naff.my advice don't watch the last series the rest is absolutely knockout!
2019-02-23,pavlin-63663,Season 7 is a Big Disappointment.,9,"dragon flew to the rescue too quickly, jon snow and daenerys sex/love happened too quickly, everything in the show goes too quickly! what, they have no money to continue got in a usual speed? or actors are tired? or rating fell?"
2019-07-23,jacqulinesnider,One of the best shows ever made,6,this has to be one of the best shows i have ever watched ever. but the last three episodes of season 8 were almost a complete let down. there were a few epic moments and the rest felt very rushed and like 7 and 1/2 seasons of character build up were thrown out the window. other than that it's an amazing show.
2019-10-03,ssn-81831,Lovely love love and loved this game,9,hi i'm pretty open to come to the north and again please please love you how are things are
2021-03-06,parsaebrahimi-57567,Wow this is masterpiece,2,this show is masterpiece. the written was amazing. the music was absolute masterpiece. the characters was very good. the story was wonderful. but the final season was a disaster. but we can not ignore the 7 seasons before that. you're gonna love it. just watch this
2020-04-13,adriantopnik,No,7,"i don't really like it. it's not my type of series. i don't know, am i stupid for not liking this?"
2021-07-25,yaseen7,*NUN SPOILERS REVIEW ON GAME OF THRONES*,4,"the most epic tv series of all time! there is a reason got has the most emmy awards of any tv show ever created.season 1: if you start to watch season 1 then you will not be able to control yourself from watching the entire game of thrones. this season introduces the game of thrones and it's character and you will get a sudden shock that three main characters of the show dies in this season which were shown very powerful and could have had a larger impact on the show and there is not too much fighting in this season but this will give you a shock in your mind. my ratings 10/10season 2 : you will be attached to the characters very much and there is a epic battle in the end it is where the show will grip you , my ratings are 9/10season 3: this gave me the greatest shock of all time and seriously you will cry when the season ends, it happened so fast and suddenly that no one expected it to go this way and you will have some serious hate fellings for some characters. my ratings 10/10.season 4: this season is my favourite season because the two characters which i hated so much were killed in this season in the most unexpected way possible and a new king is being selected in this season and there are no battles in this season. my ratings 10/10.season 5: this is where we can see the real power of the mother of the dragons and the epic battle in the wall will make you speechless and one of the main character is betrayed in the end. my ratings 10/10.season 6: a main character is reborn in this series and there is the most epic battle of the series occurs in the end and the queen reclaims her throne and killing the most hated character of the series meanwhile in the other part many of the main characters dies suddenly that even an einstein could have predicted and the king dies and a new queen is being sat on the throne. my ratings 10/10.season 7: this is where the battle of the dead and living starts which is very epic and frieghting and the queen tries to kill most of her enimies which is also very epic. my ratings are 10/10.season 8: this is why got is hated and it is correct, the characters didn't got the ending they deserved and they died in the silliest way possible because of dumb and dumber all the efforts of 10 years of this show is destroyed . my ratings are 4/10 only because of action of 3rd episode.well overall it is one of the best shows i have ever seen cuz i love battles and fiction shows and if you like the same genre then you must watch it , it is definitely worth your time."
2020-05-02,kotapatiswaraj,ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,1,"this is the best tv show i've ever watched. the cgi is top notch. with masterful direction and twists and turns. best character development which is a cherry on top.
even though the ending is bit disappointing it still worth a watch. even though you aren't in this genre of kings and dragons i bet you will not regret this at any cost ."
2020-06-06,timmyminh,Near perfect masterpiece,1,"it hurts me like hell to have rated this a 9 because it could have easily been a 10 if it wasn't for season 7 and 8. there are enough commentary on the finale so i won't go on a tangent. but i'll just say, setting the bad bits aside that this show is still a divine, everything about it was just too perfect to be true."
2021-04-06,yashdubey-84644,Thanks season 8,9,"""loving the wrong guy is worst, when you'll look back at ur past it just gives pain.""anonymousi know the show is not rewatchable anymore but still highly recommended. still 10/10 no matter how bad season 8 was."
2020-12-07,kubrickfan15,Fantastic show,9,jaw dropping and epic. this show is just awesome. one of the best ever made.
2021-05-03,qjvrpyz,Good moments and sometimes good story,7,"tyrion was overacting the entire time. it was hard to watch.i only watched seasons 1,5. still thought this show was nothing special. the gratuitous violence and sexual content was a severe detriment to the show. brought my score down a full 2.5 points. just awful.plays into shock factor way too much. most of the time the shock value has nothing of substance, it's just done for the sake of it.the story was decent. i thought the whole zombie thing was stupid. the characters aren't good either. there were only a few likeable ones but most were killed off.i would not finish watching game of thrones nor would i recommend it to anyone."
2018-05-03,cafevincent,A masterpiece that was rushed towards the end as if it was cancelled.,10,"the show starts out like a game changing masterpiece, with deep interesting characters and development, all the while things like war tactics from everyone's twisted perspectives are thoroughly enjoyed with a tv,ma rating (glorious!). after season 4 you can see they are already rushing the story too much. from what i hear a lot has been left out and grossly simplified from the books. by the end it has been completely fabricated. they should have stayed true to the books vigilantly, waiting patiently for georgie to finish them like all of us. the show currently stands as the prime example of how not to deal with the original writer's material. your eventual disappointment is pretty much guaranteed. you have been warned.apparently the meaningful way to enjoy this story is to watch the first two seasons of this show and then continue on from the third audio book of ""a song of ice and fire"" since seasons 1 and 2 play out pretty much precisely the way they do in the books and they won't confuse you with changes in characters or story lines.i have a feeling the show was actually cancelled behind the scenes for some reason, why else would they have wanted their biggest success story to be over so suddenly? as if they just had to tie up the story as fast as possible, with just enough regard for it to hopefully hold its status as an ultimate hbo article to subscribe for. got any theories why? my theory is that the main actors became too expensive for them, hence the spinoffs because all the characters had to change. who in their right mind would want to see a spinoff from these people who butchered one of the greatest source materials of our time so recklessly? you wanna see a spinoff that the people you hate the most wrote from scratch?"
2014-02-15,roberjruiz,You won't really know what is it about unless you read the books,10,"i began to see this series while i was reading the fourth book. visual effects and filming are really nice, and the environment very well recreated, and chapters are real. they added some sex that does not appear in the books, an rearranged a little the story (in the book many things happen in parallel). i am not to complain about that, because i understand that books and tv are different animals what really disappointed me about this series is that storytelling is way too fast, and some main characters are hard to differentiate from each other (specially northeners). after watching the first chapter i could only think: people that that didn't read the book must have a huge mess on their minds about who is who and what the series is about. simply it's impossible to realize about the real extent of the plot unless you read the books (that happens with many adaptations, but in this case i think you are missing most of it if you only watch the series). the first book simply has too much content for a 10 chapter season.nice series, but it could have been way better if they didn't squeeze the story so much to fit a book per season."
2021-02-23,superkt,One of the best shows to air on television,1,"i wish i could erase my memory of this show so i could do it all over again. watching these episodes week after week, year after year, were such an unforgettable experience. such a treat. they managed to have it all , characters, world building, acting, costumes, effects, storytelling, music - all of it is freaking amazing. i don't even know how else i could describe it. it's a beautiful show. there has never been a tv show that captivated an entire country quite like got did. as corny as it may sound, i am grateful to have been alive to watch it unfold, to watch the stories progress without knowing the fate of the characters on screen. i went to bed on sundays feeling some type of way based on the episode they gave us. you couldn't binge an entire season in a month. you had to wait a week or a year to find out if your favorite character will still be around. that suspension added a lot of depth to the show. you guys watching now for the first time will never understand!
like everyone else says, the ending is a let down. if you're reading these reviews, you're already aware. tbh there was no way the writers could end this show and actually please their collective audience. i did not care for it whatsoever and much of the final season is just not up to par. however, i can't take any stars off just based on season 8. everything else is too good."
2017-01-14,mohdshafiulhaque,Outstanding..... Top of its class....,10,"i don't understand, why negative reviews. its a fantasy show and so watch it, enjoy it and judge it on what it is trying to show. story of power and just power and just power. the actors outstanding, story line outstanding, locations outstanding, villains outstanding, fight sequences outstanding, simply out and out brilliant. his is an artful series; the script is intelligently written, the show is well,acted, and the direction and cinematography are easily on par with any oscar-nominated film. it's easy to get drawn into the machinations of westeros; the show is compulsive viewing. there are moments of brutal violence and sexuality that might pull viewers who aren't ready for them out of the narrative. certainly westeros is a dark world inhabited by some very disturbing characters, but the violence is at times lingered upon in a very unsettling way. although these moments may be mitigated by later plot developments, that doesn't change their impact as they happen. for viewers who can tolerate these incidents, the merits of the series may win out, but it won't be for everyone. watch and you will certainly love it. full marks to the show."
2015-06-17,anymouse2,The novelty wore off 2 seasons ago,8,"so, this started like most hbo crap: lots of blood, ""in your face"" nudity to remind you why you pay the extra instead of settling for the basic cable package, and sex more sleazy than the average hustler vid.except that the women of thrones aren't ""amazing"". they look like what the porn industry throws on the ""amateur"" flicks. and thats with the make,up. the sex was boring; there's more chemistry in a math class than on these sets. and the fighting and blood were clearly done by someone that hasn't seen combat or held any of those weapons or armor. oh, and the gay pandering is so blatant, im surprised it isn't being boycotted. im serious, until season 5 they cant do an episode without grinding your face in gay sex. it seems like the few rare scenes that don't involve homosexual sex in some way are the incest scenes. i've heard of ""blaxploitation"" as a category, but what do we call this? ""gaysploitation""? ""homosploitation""? should it be more insultive, as the ""blax"" is, to show contempt for the disrespect it does to the minority pandered to?i guess the ""kill a named character every two episodes"" mantra actually comes from the books, which is all the more reason not to read the books, to me. if i want some pompous jackwagon that spends 2 pages introducing me to the character just to immediately kill off said character, i'll go back to victorian authors like dickens, who were paid by the letter, rather than for content. we're in season 5, and the only character left from the beginning that you might care about is ari. the screen-writers have gotten so desperate cersi is naked. i realize there's an audience for middle-aged women with buzz-cuts getting pelted with garbage and sewage, i just figured it was mostly centralized in german fetishism, not hbo ""mainstream"" audience. or maybe the two are really one and the same?the only central plots across the seasons are ""winter is coming"", because apparently in this world that doesn't happen every year? idk, they never address why its so important that seasons, ya know, change and stuff... oh, and the other is, ""if you do good, your gonna get screwed"". every character that tries to ""do the right thing"", or act good, whether in character or not, pays for it. and in got, there's only one way you pay: death. often with a little creepy-border-line rapey-time as well, especially in the later seasons.do yourself a favor. if you want to watch porn, watch porn. if you want to watch tv, watch tv. avoid this hybrid abortion."
2019-01-27,kaantamtunali,MASTER PIECE,4,"it is sooo damn good that you will see any other tv series as mediocre. there is no other tv series is close to this one. must see..but be warned when you start this you won't like any other show as this one when it ends, we all will be feel an emptiness. hell waiting for other season becomes harder and harder. get ready to lose yourselves in westeros, enchanted,dangerous,mysterious,brutal,emotional,action packet,thrilled,horrifying and beautiful fantasy world. what are you still waiting for wasting your time reading this. if you haven't started it already you have to start this masterpiece right now."
2019-04-18,eborella63,THE BEST SHOW ON TV,4,"i've been watching got now yearly since it starts in 2011, every year i rewatch all episodes available and every time there are new things i missed on the previously viewed episodes. the show is well written, the actors are great, and everything else the crew did was amazing. i read all 5 books after watching the first season, it took me an entire summer to go through all 5 (around 5000 pages) books, and i can tell that the creators of the show did an amazing job adapting the books to screen. now, the show is caught up with the books, but i still find the storytelling from the writers of the show, incredibly interesting. i'm really sad that this is the last season, this show is the best show that i've ever watched, i love everything about it. i will continue to watch got every year even after the end. job well done and congratulations to all the men and women who made this show such a success, first class crew and stars."
2019-05-16,eborella63,GREATEST SHOW EVER,6,"i just fell in love with the characters after reading all 5 books of the series. the show is really great and i enjoyed all 7 seasons and now the 8th and final season is ending, i have to say that the 5th episode of season 8 made me cringe, i have no say, my hope was for daenarys to get to the iron throne and reign for years to come with her dragons, but to write her off as insane like that after 7 seasons of following her good heart, it just made me mad and sad at the same time. the show is incredible but they did a poor job on the penultimate episode, they could have written something much better for our girl and the dragons. let's hope for a good finale."
2019-05-03,shanelester97,Phenomenal,10,to the people rating it one star just because of one episode? really? pathetic. this show is amazing 😉
2019-05-03,shanelester97,Recommended,6,"amazing show, it would have an even higher rating if people didn't rate it one star for it being popular. soundtrack, camera, acting, storyline, the art is just phenomenal and it's things like that make the show one of the best, definitely deserves imdb number 1 on top 250 in my opinion 10/10 recommended."
2019-08-06,ketekete,Used to be the best,10,"season 1,6 is the best television in our generation but season 7 was so bad it killed the entire series and season 8 was horrible also i don't understand why they took 2 years to write season 8 and this the best they could do i will still give it a 10 because of the first seasons but season 7 and 8 was trash"
2019-09-25,ketekete,........,8,"for the people who will watch it in the future prepare to be disappointed.
i will not recommend this series to any one ever again because of the last 2 horrible seasons but the first 6 is some of the best tv you will ever going to see so i am confused about how i rate this series.
it's worth the watch the first 6 seasons so"
2019-05-13,coltpython82,Biggest let down in television history.,10,"anyone who has watched this blue ball of a show will understand why season eight's last few episodes took a series that once had the potential to be the greatest show of all time and turned it into one long, drawn out denial video. yes hbo and grrm manipulated all of us enough to sit through eight seasons of none stop easter eggs and hints that eventually led to nowhere, as we all watched in anticipation as the creators took the biggest mcguffin of all time and tossed it in the trash in favor of their own politics. they had us all fooled into believing jon snow was integral to the plot and his character arc would pay off in the end... yeah no. what a waste of an amazing character. the ending to this show could have been talked about for years to come, confirming epic dvd sales and repeated viewing, but instead nearly every fan is disgusted and now has no interest in the prequel series coming later this year. congratulations hbo and grrm you destroyed your legacy!"
2019-05-29,rnelon,Awful show,1,"what a waste of time. if you haven't watched this show and insist on doing so, save some sanity by not watching the last season. just make up your own ending and play it in your head. i really wish i never bothered with this show."
2016-06-16,anish-25809,Excellent,10,"this show is a phenomenon.it is so new and original.very few shows can claim to be as great as this one.it gets everything right.magnificent visuals,amazing performances and shocking twists around every corner.even the child actors are really good.every single season improves on the previous one.the characters are so awesome.my favourite is tyrion lannister.peter dinklage is amazing and is easily the best actor in the entire cast.this show has to be the most complicated and intricate show ever.and that is what makes it awesome.my favourite season is the fifth one.season 6 is going on right now,and the stakes are super high.this show shows no signs of running out of steam.by far the best on tv."
2019-05-20,wkin,The last one was the worst.,9,"almost 80 very good episodes. unfortunately the last season and especially the last episode was a disappointment. the seven realms became 6 just to advertise sansa (dark pohoenix). it would be better for cersie to die of heart attack, jon snow to fall from the dragon, daenarys to the barbeque girl and the dragon to turn into chicken. a comedy. a melancholy ending. rip"

2019-06-13,levinsonianj,HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RATE THIS,10,"seriously though, how do you rate something with a perfect beginning, a good middle, and an awful ending that butchers every character and plot line? the show used to have logic, it used to have real stakes and consequences.it used to have a large group of memorable unique and complex characters. it used to have a great mix of fantasy, drama, and politics. the last two seasons lost all of this. before when characters died it was surprising yet didn't come out of nowhere, in season 7 and 8 characters just die for shock value. i appreciate the show for what it once was and i respect the actors and crew but the writers really messed up. if you honestly believe the finale was perfect then you didn't get what the show was about."

2019-06-09,markassbrownie,Re-judgement of GOT.,4,"got used to be so good in its early seasons, but now that the final season is over, we should rejudge the whole show in a different light.undisputedly, the first four seasons of got are simply the best. they successfully changed and redefined the whole fantasy genre since tolkien's inception of middle earth. their legacy would be enshrined in pop culture for decades to come.but the final few seasons have gone downhill since the show run out of the original source materials, and eventually turned in to a pile of irredeemable garbage. all the character arcs ruined, all the plot developments abandoned, and all the world settings ignored. the ignorance and arrogance of david benioff and d. b. weiss are directly responsible for the downfall of got and these two incompetent buffoons must be stopped before they get their dirty hands on the star wars franchise. fandoms of the world, unite ! before it's too late."
2020-08-01,conorsheehan-89113,The ending sucked,4,would have been 10 stars if the ending hadn't sucked so bad. apparently the producers / directors rushed it so they could work on the new star wars movie.
2020-07-07,advocate-6,Barely better than average,10,"while the budget was good and there were lots of interesting story points, the plot was convoluted as hell, there were plot holes everywhere, and major parts of the story simply come and go without cause (dire wolves, raising the dead, giants, magic, dragons, anyone?). if any of those things were known to be real at any time they'd instantly become the focus of all power,struggles. also, people don't change character traits from good to evil over and over. basically, i never discovered why i should care about these people doing these things and by the end i knew that even if the books were amazing, the tv show was absolutely not."
2020-07-03,damfaz,Undoubtedly the most memorable series of the decade,10,"game of thrones is the most watched series of 2010s, especially from the 7th season on. maybe the success it reached is the reason of its decline in the last two seasons. but i'm not here to say anything bad since it has already received many negative comments. so let's focus on the spectacular first seasons of the series.the strong points of the series are the plot's and the characters' developments. the first season is aimed at psychologically preparing us for the others. no matter if you are an honorable person or an evil one, you can survive only if you learn to play the game of thrones. as cersei said""in the game of thrones, you win or you die"".game of thrones' cast is wide and each character has its own charisma. we saw the stark siblings growing in this violent world. we both hated and loved lannisters for the decisions they took in their lives. we have been cheated like rookies by littlefinger's and varys' subterfuges. we have lived all the essos adventures with daenerys, who started her adventure as an innocent child. we went beyond the wall with jon snow and bran to see that an higher danger was coming to westeros. we suffered and rejoiced with all the characters in a very intense way because of the tremendous turns of events.game of thrones is iconic and it will be for sure a source of inspiration for many future tv shows. music, direction, scripting, everything is meticolously studied. fantasy, drama, romance and adventure mix up in a perfect combo which allows this series to be appreciated by everyone of all ages.i'm sad to admit that what i've just said refers only to the first 5,6 seasons. and this is the reason why i rate it 9/10. we will never forget game of thrones, it doesn't matter if for the bad finale, the red wedding, or dany's storyline."
2019-06-09,fran-6591northstar,Yep... screwed worst than Dexter,7,what can you say...no one can write a good ending these days...pure crap
2019-09-23,frankaub-1,Amazing show but what a bad ending,10,"what can we say that haven been said about game of thrones? well, nothing but i will try to add some nuance into it. first of all, game of thrones season 4 is ma favorite season of every tv show i've ever listened too. the show is globally very good, some of the best acting performance of all time from sean bean, charles dance, pedro pascal and, of course, from peter dinklage. the story is generally good, surprising and is not boring and predictable like most fantasy stories. game of thrones and the sources material the books of a song of ice and fire are focus on family, the inside battle of good and bad, etc. contrary to a lot of fans, i liked the fact that danny turned mad. she was always power hungry and her ego was totally out of control. i must admit that it should have been done better. what disappointed me was the last two seasons. they are rush and they left too many questions not answer. why the night king came back now? who was he? plus, i really hate the idea that they chose bran as a king... he said it himself that he cannot be the lord of anything but being the king of the 6 kingdom he can? and finally i didn't want jon or any other character to be a fantasy hero like we've seen so many times, but that ending let me feel bad specially for jon snow. i do understand that writing a great ending to this awsome show was an impossible task, but this should have been better. anyways i gave it an 7/10 and after season 8 i can say that breaking bad was better only because of the great ending of breaking bad and the very bad ending of game of thrones."
2011-04-22,propsguy,"Wanted this to be a gem, all I got was soft porn.",2,"this show was hyped so much that i couldn't wait to see it. the production values seemed high and the actors are of great lineage. so what went wrong? well i blame myself really. i got older and now when i watch a programme i'm more interested in plot and character development than lingering shots of women entering a bath. now don't get me wrong here, if that shot was required for the development of the show, put it in by all means. but most of these scenes were totally gratuitous. plus there seemed to be a gender bias at work, there were no shots of male frontal nudity.in conclusion i think that this show was made for males aged 18,35. fine no problem there. i just don't think that i fit that profile any longer."
2021-02-11,mustangride,Do not invest your time in this series,9,"game of thrones started off along the book lines and the first 4 seasons were incredible (possibly some of the best to ever be on the small screen).but after season 4 it was clear the directors and producers ran out of source material and were winging it, it is also clear in my opinion they (writers and producers) were great at adaptation of source material, they were incredibly inept at original material. you have to understand one of them even gagged ""dead pool"" showing even more they do not understand source material.the author of the series has not finished the last two books and his last book in the series was released 2011. my opinion again, but the author got rich from hbo and was content to make more money on the talk circuit and other places and lost interest in finishing the series.because of the authors actions the series writers and producers were left to finish it on their own and failed miserable, a quick web,search will show you how miserably they failed.so short version, do not watch this it had potential but then turned in to a dumpster fire"
2019-05-23,janbi-87650,Season 8 is a Nonsense.,10,"pity i started watching it. in my opinion s.8 is a pile of rubbish. the show creators don't care about us any more. they think because we are simple tv watchers, we don't see the difference between good show and a bad one. i am so disappointed."
2019-12-15,nadinethart,Sorry Not For Me,8,"i am sorry, i watched it all but i just did not like it. i was not drawn to it and it was all so slow. and i did not feel any emotions. i get it why people like got, it is just not my type of thing. although they had a beautiful decor, costume, visual effects, etc."

2020-04-21,cbreinvestments,Save the drama for your mama,10,"watched and loved all 8 seasons and twice but the end left a bitter taste in my mouth. the mother of dragons killed by her own lover. john snow killing her own lover. death, regret and guilt. where have i seen that before ? oh in every single ending i hated watching. 8 years rooting for two characters that would ultimately end up destroying each other. a lot of people do not like happy endings, not my cup of tea."
2020-08-01,matthewleighton,Great!,10,"it takes a while to watch every episode, i first started watching and stopped at season 5, then i started again and really enjoyed it. a lot of people really hated the last season, yes the ending was bad, but i still enjoyed it the battle of winter fell was one of my favourites, if you couldn't see what was going on you're just blind lmao, the other battles are also amazing. 9/10 would be a 10 but the ending was pretty bad but it definitely doesn't make the whole show bad just most of the last season."
2021-05-02,keithhainzl,The best 6 seasons ever made throughout history,5,"this show could have been the best tv show in the world. if you haven't watched it yet, consider yourself one of the lucky ones because if you're somebody who likes fantasy, history and family drama, there's no show out there that does it better than game of thrones. but please don't watch everything after season 6! season 7 and (especially) season 8 are practically a crime and should not be considered canon in my (and many other people's) opinion. only watch them if you are very brave.the first 6 seasons are a gift and a blessing and you will always want to know what will happen next. every character is well written and the story is just impeccable! i don't even have to start with the music and set design. the heroes have their flaws, the villains are relatable and you immediately understand everyone's agenda and motivations. what a tremendous piece of television.the last two seasons have destroyed the show for me, otherwise it would have been a 10/10."
2019-05-22,paulrf85,GOT is GOAT,10,"this is literally the best show that exists. unfortunately it had to end but it is still the goat! just completed the rewatch so i'm good for a while, then i'll have to rewatch again in a year or two."
2019-12-07,xjumper65,"If you didn't like season 8, you weren't paying attention",4,"i don't understand the people who were disappointed in season 8. i've literally read everything written or sanctioned by grrm on a song of ice and fire and was not disappointed in any aspect of this tv show. imo, it is the most amazingly excellent show ever made. the only reason i can think that people don't like it is 1) people tend to be lemmings and are influenced by people who are often stupider than they are so they let their opinions become poisoned by others and simply jump on the bandwagon when others say they don't like it 2) misunderstanding or lack of thoughtful consideration of the characters, themes, and plots of the entire series 3) irrational misperception that the fewer number of episodes in the last 2 seasons meant the writers and producers were paying short shrift to the story which is clearly not the case when you consider the episode lengths, the predicted number of total episodes from the outset, and the fact that there was resolution to all major plot lines and characters that remained true to the character's story arcs and nature. if they were to investigate, those who say the season was rushed would learn that there was only suppose to be a season 7 with 13 episodes, but with the enormously ambitious scale of these last 2 seasons, the producers were forced to break it into 2 seasons with fewer episodes per season (although these were exceptionally long episodes so the total time was nearly the same. this was done to allow time for post production without the need for an even longer break between seasons. from the outset they planes for about episodes/hours to tell this story. guess how many episodes hours there were: 73, some of which were well over an hour. they also began planning seasons 7 and 8, 5 years before they aired so i have yet to see how the argument that they rushed season 8 holds any water. the scale of s8ep3 was so great that it alone required 18 months of work and years of planning. to even suggest that the team ""phoned it in"" is absurd and demonstrates the ignorance of the person making that assertion. s8ep3, the long night was layered, complex, a technical miracle, absolutely grueling for the writers, director, producers, and cast and crew, not to mention it's one the single most expensive episodes of tv ever produced and contained the largest and longest battle sequence ever filmed for tv or movies. the writing and editing expertly concealed the direction of the plot, contained several unexpected twists, killed off several beloved characters, and kept the viewer on the edge of their seats. and despite the incredibly length of the battle, they kept it fresh by not dragging out fight scenes, brilliant editing and story sequencing that allowed them to switch between characters and subplots to avoid viewer fatigue. that episode is the embodiment of the word ""epic"" and i defy any intelligent and informed person to successfully defend the argument that season 8 and especially episode 3 are anything less than ground,breaking and incomparable television. like i said, i have yet to meet anyone in person or read anything online that makes a cogent argument against it."
2019-05-21,john-connor-freedomfight,Hope for mankind destroyed in a single act of cowardice,10,"it could have been epic, queen daenerys i targaryen could have saved the world from the slavers but then she is cowardly murdered by the traitor jon snow.the evil schemers of westeros (united kingdom) won in the end over the true heroes of the show, queen daenerys i targaryen and her loyal companions. that is what you get for trying to save a people that does not want to be saved daenerys.i could have told you! what a shame! she should never have returned to westeros (united kingdom) and that that evil empire would have been destroyed by the night king and his army, those ungrateful treacherous lot would most certainly have deserved it.i am angry at the writers but most of all i am angry at myself for allowing myself to belive that something good could come out of the kingdom of evil (united kingdom), that they would allow a savior to live and to defeat the oppressors.oh how i wished the dragon had burned the weasley coward jon snow alive and then removed all the little wesles of westeros from existence as just punishment for murdering his queen."
2014-07-17,cbockiii,The Best of the Best,1,"i watched the first two seasons on demand, then i decided to read all 5 books. i loved the books, but after season 4 i'm convinced that the show is better. the casting of each character is perfect, particularly for oberyn martell and brienne. peter dinklage is terrific and emilia clarke is sex on wheels. there is a lot of turnover in the casting and i miss some of my favorite characters, but that's just the story. seasons 1 and 2 were superb, season 3 dragged a tiny bit and season 4 was the best of the series so far. largely because of oberyn martell. the show deviates from the book plot a little bit, and just about all of them actually improved the story , filled some holes with a sensible change. grand slam home run, hbo. there are a ton of great hbo shows and this is the crown jewel. hbo series beat the crap out of 99% of the movies you're going to find in the theaters now."
2015-11-19,charleswjoke,Fantastic (but lacking if book fan),10,"game of thrones is an increasingly hard tv series to review. i started the show during the third season but have since invested a lot of time to the book series and have started to understand the amazing complexity that george rr martin has weaved throughout his emotional masterpiece. sadly, the tv show cant replicate this complexity of each character development and plot line but it can give the audience an enjoyable, funny, clever but somewhat lacking version of asoiaf. if one watches the show without the books, one will enjoy the events even though they are tough to witness and recall the tragedies of recent emotional stories such as the wire. but a book reader will be ultimately left with a shallow view of the multi dimensional stories that they have read throughout 5 books. the performances are excellent but the characters themselves pale next to the complex characteristics of each character in terms of psychology and what grr martin considers the apex of asoiaf: the human heart in conflict with itself."
2019-05-28,onurmems,Seasons 1-5 magnificent but from there Downhill,2,"seasons 6,7 were very bad but season 8 was beyond terrible. it's like they deliberately made it bad.acting was great but the writing from season 6 went downhill. when you start a story with so many characters and mystical intricacies, you better have some kind of plan how they generally make sense at the end of the story. maybe g martin didn't and that's why he can't finish the books.the tv writers didn't for sure, after writing the tragic comedy of s8. such a shame and preventable because even without the books and decent tv writer should be able to come up with a better last season than they have."
2019-05-05,ben_jarmin_4,"The build up is for nothing, writers screw fans",7,"the build up of the white walkers is tantalising. the wait we all went through to get to the final show down was like hot coals under our feet. all the merchandise stated ""winter is coming"". but as the series progressed, the writing started to fall. sure, there were some pretty stupid hollywood plots, however all was forgiven because it was leading somewhere. now, it was all for nothing. the biggest adversary in tv history turns out to have absolutely no other purpose than finning out the northern army. and the death of the night king was lazy, pathetic and just sums up d&d's writing ability. i really enjoyed the ride, it made me read the books and history of asoiaf, but the outcome does an absolute disservice to the entire fiction. it's such a shame. #justiceforthenightking"
2019-05-20,ccrisss,Compelled to lower rating after final season,2,"the stars are for seasons 1,6. they were brilliant.but it's such a shame how d&d burned this to the ground with their incompetence in the final season. it almost seemed like they deliberately sabotaged it. it's that bad.sadly, i can't recommend this series to anyone anymore. the pathetic last season completely ruined it.the only justice for this is if d&d would never be allowed to write anything ever again."
2012-04-03,maz4u61,Something to cheer about!!!!,1,"i kind of click on first episode of got out of blue. the moment episode started, the music caught my attention. when the episode ended, i knew it would be a good ride till the end. and i was not disappointed, i deeply enjoyed the show. the acting was excellent. the cast was amazing. sean bean was amazing. all the supporting cast did really good job. i really enjoyed emilia clark""s part. she is beautiful and acts really well. the show is closely related to everyday life and struggle of different part of the world tries to get a piece of action (just like the present situation of the world where all countries are trying to get upper hand on others ). overall, its one of the best show that came out. if you have not watch it yet, then arrange your stuff and have a look."
2018-01-06,movieguy96,Season 7 review,10,"i have just finished binge,watching game of thrones season 7. over the years i have viewed the show staggered somewhat; i don't have sky or any streaming services available. consequently i have been limited to purchasing the dvd boxsets when i see fit. this naturally means i am never caught up in the initial hype which surrounds the show whenever a new season arises. moreover i'm admittedly not an avid fan of the fantasy genre. i can happily live in a world without lord of the rings, or the hobbit.i have always had a deep respect for game of thrones, for its technical achievement in bringing together a considerable array of talent from tv and film, as well as merging together the fantastical element, with the grim realities of human conflict and psychology.you can be forgiven, though, for not finding the early seasons accessible. i certainly didnt. there was a raw unpredictability constantly lingering, as well as a horrificly uncanny ability to mirror our own world within the constraints of its setting. maybe this was necessary, as we needed to be desensitized to george r. r. martin's unique vision of pure terror, and binary opposition, so we could truely understand the complex nature of the interweaving disparate strands overlapping each other.so here we are, season 7. i feel there have been great tonal shifts over the years. after the aforementioned first three seasons, 4, 5, and 6, were a lengthy prologue for what was to follow. in this respect it delved deeper into this multilayered universe, and the producers were obviously having a ball over the lavish production design, and gifted artists at their disposal. there was a sense of monotony and fatigue starting to set in though admittedly. despite some interesting plot and character development, the show was starting to stagnate.fortunately, season 6 was an effective precursor, which not only showed a noticeable upgrade in the visual effects on display, but had the confidence to start joining together pieces of this complex puzzle, in a way which made sense for the audience, and seemed logical to how the decisions and actions of certain characters would bring them to this moment.to say season 7 is epic is an understatement. what has really impressed me about this one in particular is its sheer audacity in terms of scale and story structure, as well as the fact it manages to transcend the conventions of its genre to become something so much more; a parable in comradship, deceit, tragedy, war, and love, all presented as a slow-burning action-adventure. it is the closest i have seen to a theatrical movie being created for the small screen. to paraphrase mark kermode when reviewing the last jedi, it's like there is a set goal in mind on what direction game of thrones will go in, and it's within those seven episodes that it has to go from *here* to *there*. in other words, it feels like the producers have consummately created a tight bundle, through which their mission is to move the story on in a kinetically-charged style. above all though, for pure entertainment value you cannot beat this. i found the penultimate, and final, episodes, two of the finest instalments ever committed to screen. the transitions between the differing plot strands had a natural flow and motion to them. this was evident with the intriguing interplay between sansa and arya, as they underwent their own complex dilemmas whilst adjusting back into their old lives at winterfell; a relatively slow-burning but nonetheless intense segment of the season, -- coupled with the boys-own adventure occurring beyond the wall. to have these disparate characters all merging together and venturing out to team up against ininsurmountable odds was thrilling, and again a pure joy to see how they all bounced off each other. this turned out to be a technically and visually impressive story arc encompassed in the space of two episodes, which goes to reiterate the firm grip the producers have for telling the narrative. the final set piece, which races at a breakneck rate, leaves the audience with a biting sense of uncertainty. we are constantly aware of the very real threat faced by the characters here. i was taken aback by the consummate skill displayed, of the scriptwriters and directors, to accomplish a tightly-wrapped package which wholly satisfies, without feeling bloated and overstuffed with unnecessary plot exposition. the ability to mingle together both the magnificently mounted action sequences (the dothraki raid on the lannister army, and the final scene of the night king's army marching forward, are two more notable examples), with the smaller reserved set pieces is commendable. there is a pure verve and dynamism felt in these action scenes, all with a total control on how to emotionally manipulate us, the audience.just as much credit should go to the actors though, who all seem to be having the time of their lives, and whose enthusiasm and commitment to performance lend itself immensely to what extent we immerse ourselves in this world. in season 7, i found the blossoming relationship between jon snow and daenarys to add some dramatic emotional heft to the story. by not adhering to the constraints of the previous seasons, and by becoming its own beast entirely, with the confidence to continue the show in a fluid yet meticulous execution, this makes season 7 a much more enriching experience.so there we are! a true pleasure from start to finish, here's hoping season 8 continues the trend, and ensures that it ends in style!"
2019-04-09,oceangirl34,Incredible show,6,"a few years ago i dismissed this show as being terrible after watching a couple of episodes, but i gave it another try today and i totally changed my mind. this is definitely one of the best shows i have ever seen and i haven't finished watching the first season yet."

2021-09-25,dust_in_it_off,9/10 Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades,6,"one of the best shows of all time. would have been a 10/10 and possibly the best show if not for the ending. they could have pulled off the ending they had if it would have been set up a little better, maybe with another season, but seasons 1,6 were solid. the blame for the last season falls squarely on the show runners.hbo and george rr martin wanted to keep the show going but, benioff and weiss were done. look i get it, after 10 years they wanted to do something different, but the fact they tried to blame the fans was ridiculous. in the same breath, they tried to say if you didn't see the ending coming you weren't paying attention, while also saying that the reason aria kills the knight king was because they wanted it to be unexpected. they dropped the ball and trying to lash out at the fans for their screw up was pathetic.imo, the last season should have had the episode of the bells happen before the long knight, but with danny holding back at the last second. she takes kings landing without the massacre and then they go north. the long knight should have been the last to second last episode, with the knight king killing danny and then john killing the knight king. being a targaryen, stark, and the king beyond the wall, he unites the kingdoms.bran becoming king was a joke especially since he said multiple times he couldn't and didn't want to be (although apparently he knew the whole time?!) it also doesn't make sense that sansa and the north remain independent because they don't trust the south, even though both the south and north are ruled by starks! the only thing in the end that made sense was that john would flee beyond the wall (even he didn't want to live in the world benioff and weiss left behind).if not for the failings of the last season, got from start to finish would hold the mantle for the most engrossing show ever. the last season will always be a stain. even though it probably shouldn't, it will be remembered more for its miserable end than the wonderful journey that got it there. the last season casts a shadow over one of the best shows ever, and leaves fans wondering what if."

2019-05-18,luismd-50284,The end of an era,10,"and so it ends. one thing i believe people should understand (especially someone who hasn't watched the show yet and probably won't anymore because of the low ratings of season eight) is that being game of thrones the most popular tv show in the world, a mass culture phenomenon, an extremely complex story with dozens of characters and storylines, and having the biggest audience in the world, it was always going to be impossible to please and live up to everyone's expectations. with an audience such big and demanding, there would always be millions of people who wouldn't like the way it ended, no matter what the end was. the more the viewers, the more the chances of not giving everyone what they want. that's math and logic. even if the last season was reshot three times, there would still be millions of ""disappointed"" and unsatisfied fans because this or that character didn't have the end they wanted, because this or that theory didn't come true, etc., etc. the fact that it went in the penultimate episode from one of the best tv shows ever to the ""worst"" tv show ever in many viewers' opinions, is a clear and obvious sign of expectations not being met for everybody. nothing goes from ""the best"" to ""the worst"" in the end, after more than 70 episodes, unless the finale wasn't what i expected it to be and unless i'm being subjective instead of objective.given the fact that the showrunners actually did bother to at least end the series, while r. r. martin probably doesn't even know how and if he will ever end the story, i think their work has all the merit. at this point people are just overreacting. it's no more than collective hysteria by now, which is being reinforced by the democracy of social media, where everyone gets to give their opinion, be influenced by the opinions of others, share those opinions, turn them into memes, make a mountain out of a molehill about literally everything. social media has thus been the best and the worst thing that happened to game of thrones. it contributed to the rise and establishment of the show as one of the most relevant and influent cultural phenomena, but would also contribute to its inevitable fall and backlash from the moment it had in hands the herculean task of having to satisfy every single one of the millions and millions of fans in the day it ended. one thing is for sure though: game of thrones has earned and maintained the title of the most controversial tv show ever and accomplished what ultimately every tv show wants to: to have everyone talking about it. like it or not, love it or hate it.i for one am thankful and have enjoyed all of the seasons and all the episodes. i take the show for what it is, entertainment, i don't take it too seriously, and i can say that to me it has been the best hell of a ride i've haver had when it comes to tv. i know i won't have another experience like game of thrones till the day i die."
2017-07-25,nmfsd,Best show on TV and in the history of film,1,"unbelievable everything! the dynamics between the plot and the characters are outstanding. it always makes me wanting more! the character development is one of its best qualities, but there are so many other great things about it that i just feel overwhelmed by its glorious perfectness. the story line is always exciting and unpredictable. the writers and directors do an excellent job at putting the viewer in the character's shoes, giving empathy to all the characters and their decisions; the good and bad. the special effects are fantastic but not over used like so many michael bay type films. sometimes, it is so realistic, you feel disgusted and,or relieved, however this only exemplifies its poignant nature. real truths are brought out. even though it is a fictional world, the characters still act like real people in dire situations. this is truly a masterpiece."

2020-06-28,jazwierzchowski-26349,7 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 1 > 8 > 2 > 6,9,"season 1: grounded by a slew of deeply crafted characters, game of thrones' debut season plunged viewers into a world of sex and violence with a story that was instantly gripping and impressively complex, if at times perfunctory. (9/10)season 2:
game of thrones fleshed out its rich world further in season 2, which was mostly fueled by exposition and political intrigue; but it was peppered with enough bloody action and intrinsic sexuality to maintain the show's singular charm. (8/10)season 3:
game of thrones earnestly doubled down on its sumptuous production and refined character work, cementing itself as tv's strongest and most effective fantasy with a third season that contained more mythical elements and unpredictable twists than ever before. (10/10)season 4:
game of thrones' refreshingly focused fourth season continued to hone its signature blend of top tier character development, intricate political machinations, and spectacular set pieces. (10/10)season 5:
complete with a host of exotic new locations, game of thrones delved deeper into uncharted tv territory with its darkest, craftiest, and most thematic season thus far. (10/10)season 6:
game of thrones' first outing without source material proved to be a wobbly one ,- season 6 was, at best, a slowburn that culminated in the best two episodes of the entire series; at worst, it was a plodding and desultory transitional season. (6/10)season 7:
game of thrones returned to form with cinematic battles and high stakes power plays thanks to a narrative sleight-of-hand that helped the show's disparate plot threads coalesce, resulting in long term payoffs for its lovable characters -- tragic or otherwise. (10/10)season 8:
game of thrones' final chapter lacked organic storytelling, leaving behind narrative shortcuts and missed opportunities in its fiery wake. however, it still managed to coherently wrap up most character arcs and twist the knife in enough unexpected ways to end on a satisfying note, all with the help of jaw-dropping visual effects.

2021-06-24,diamondsfan,We were so close,10,"game of thrones was an amazing piece of work seasons 1,6 having some of my favourite moments of tv of all time great storytelling and even walking risky paths like killing main characters but the final 2 seasons really hurt the shows legacy season 7 was ok at best with some shining moments but season 8 destroyed what could have been one of the best shows ever made we were so close to having a modern masterpiece reaching the standards of top tier shows like breaking bad and the sopranos but i guess game of thrones just lost its way by the end of it and for that it's truly upsetting."

""a game of thrones"" aka ""a song of ice and fire"" is: clever in its narrative; entertaining and really complex but therefor way more satisfying than anything i ever watched; brings up political and even ethical questions in a way which doesn't make them look cheap;.... just puts a shame on every single badly-delivered fantasy series out there ...if you haven't watched it yet - even if you're not in fantasy or knights and swords - you may want to give this series a try."

2011-11-14,valithanithizum,Masterful Cinema,7,"after sitting down and watching the whole season in one sitting, i truly experienced something deeply engrossing, highly emotional, filled with dark plot twists, fantastic visuals, and storytelling of epic proportions.watching the whole season in one sitting blows most comparative movies out of the water, this is masterful cinema at it's finest.huge character development, on top of some of the best acting performances i've ever seen. from the lead characters to the peasants, wanderers, and barbarians every role in the whole show is excellent. which i think adds vastly to it's depth. the scenery, the environment, the atmosphere , awe inspiring, breathless, and at times just magical.this is by far the top tv series, the only thing i can see topping this anytime soon, is season 2. which trust me, can't come soon enough. after this 10 hour marathon, i could probably watch another 50 hours straight. it's that engrossing, and with the way they left the ending of season one with so many questions unanswered and the plot developing, the second season should be even more amazing."
2017-07-30,silent_cal,"Winter is Coming, at the Pace of a Glacier",10,"""a song of ice and fire"" is a series of fast,paced fantasy epics by novelist george r.r. martin. with a total of 4,451 pages so far, it took me a little over a month to read. it's an exciting parade of plot twists and prophecies, and explores a rich secondary world with all its cultures and history through the points of view of a diverse cast of characters.""game of thrones"" is an hbo television series based on those books. it has lasted six seasons so far, and each one feels like an eternity. it is pedantic, talkative, static, and predictable. the progress of its narrative mirrors the structure of its opening theme music: circular, monotonous, and endlessly repetitive. its plot twists take the form of stabbings, beheadings, and betrayals, but for all their apparent randomness they arrive at regular intervals -- when things are going well for a character, you know his throat will be slit by the end of the episode.the novels were told from the points of view of its main characters, and its perspective broadened with each book, illuminating new corners of the world of westeros and shedding new light on what's gone before. reading the books is an experience of ongoing revelation. we gradually come to understand the story's villains, and that understanding engenders our sympathy. the show is more direct. everything is laid bare, and the characters are transformed into cogs in the convoluted machinery of the plot. the net result is that none of the characters are truly sympathetic; we can only watch the show objectively, without really caring about what happens to anyone. all men must die, and all got characters will commit terrible deeds for selfish ends.stylistically, the show is bewilderingly dull. when the tension should be ratcheting up, tyrion and his brother jaime pause for a conversation about their mentally challenged cousin. littlefinger and varys, the show's resident machiavellian schemers, regularly deliver expository speeches. other characters proclaim their motives out loud, while still others happily announce things that everyone should already know. it creates the singular impression that the scripts are ninety percent filler. the gears of the plot keep inexorably turning, and the writers struggle to keep up."

2019-05-21,michael_ransom,"That is it! GOT is over. Sadly a huge letdown in the last season. Here is my review, 8 years after I rated GOT the first time.",10,"originally i rated the entire show with solid 10/10 stars. the suspence and drama it delivered, were just amazing. awesome characters you were rooting for and an insanely deep world made it almost a torture to wait for the next season.a few days ago the final episode of game of thrones last season has aired and sadly...it sucked! the whole final season was just a rushed mess and left you very disapointed. do not get me wrong, it is ok that everything happens as it happens but is goes way to fast. the character changes make no sence, becuase of the poor, rushed writing. i get what the writer wanted to tell us but they should have taken more time to build all this up. 6 episodes were just not enough. it would have needed another whole season to make it believable.the only good thing about the final season is the acting. peter dinklage especially did an awesome job with what he was given. over all the acting in this show was superb...with the exception of a cameo by a certain mussician in season 7...since the last season is done so very poorly i have to revoke my previous rating. even if i see the good season now, i will always remeber how bad and lazy the writing is going to get. that will make it hard to rewatch the show in the future. it appears as if everything the writers have build up in the first seasons, does not matter, so i have to give the whole show a 7/10 rating.if you have not seen game of trones yet, either don't watch it, or stop after season 7. it would probaply be best to wait for grrm to finish the novels and read them instead.that's it folks...and all hail to the queen of starbucks..."

2019-05-20,krawia,Great Start Then Disappointing,9,"the first four seasons are fantastic a 10/10 but as the show runners stopped adapting the source material and then eventually ran out of it all went downhill. every season they manage to have better hair, costumes, music and cgi but that is not why people watch. people the show watched for a good story that is not the usual, something fresh.as the seasons go by the respect for the medieval setting starts to disappear, travel is done in an instant and events happen just for the plot no matter how logical they are.in terms of writing: seasons 1,4 10/10
season 5 7/10 - the beginning of the dip in quality
season 6 7/10

2020-12-12,troyhawke,Oh that darned season 8,10,"game of thrones has some redeeming elements and scenes.most scenes involving tywin lannister are good. he has a knack for putting people in their actual proper place, and noone dares to oppose. this is the only character worth watching, and rooting for, in the whole series. of course they had to remove this example of toxic masculinity and replace him with limp wristed cowards and «strong» women. otherwise the series would be over and done with after season 3 or whatever.other good scenes: when the «sparrows» and the mosque of baelor melts in green fire while the princess is watching.when that giant guy squashes the head of that cocky degenerate.the rest is pure garbage.btw why don't they replace all the soldiers with women and girls? they are clearly better in all aspects. lol completely ridiculous.the nomads (dullraki or whatever) are laughably overpowered in the series. basically nothing but light cavalry rabble who in reality would be easily defeated by spearmen in good order.season 8 is the best season, because it's the end, and a fitting end it is."

2016-07-12,alfoster33,"There's a reason why this show is atop of the rest in most of ranks, and it's simply because is THE BEST.",10,"after breaking bad i thought no tv show or story line would be better. turn out i was wrong, though not entirely considering they are very different shows in all kind of ways. sure bb will always have a place in my heart. that being say, if you are looking something else to watch, something really extraordinary, game of trhones has everything you would wish and more, much much more. the story itself, with 3 main plots and such nice development across the seasons, could be enough to make your mind. we have the history of the 7 kingdoms in which one of them struggles an allies with the others for power, for love, for family or glory. everything is connected in the world of westeros (the main continent where the story goes on). the seize of power, fighting all in all to see who sits on the iron throne is the goal here. but another thing and not less important is the characters (and also the cast portraying them) that fills the roles and make us closer and closer as the plot flows. let me give you a little advice, do not stick too much with any of them, could bring you a lot of grief. trust me. landscapes, montage, customs, cgi, everything makes it feel as real as it can be, getting better from season to season. finally, a mystic, terrible and powerful force is awakening to threat the entire world, and there's an old prophecy that says one day will born a prince that was promise, and his song will be the song of ice and fire, which is the tittle of the whole saga from the books from where the show was adapted. so, stop reading and go watch this unique fiction fantasy drama action series, cause if you miss it, you'll be missing the greatest adventure of your lifetime."
2019-04-25,adilmahsan,A Singular Phenomenon,10,"this is a very special show... it isn't perfect, it has its flaws, especially when one compares it with the books, but it is nonetheless a very special show... a singular phenomenon... singular in terms of its combination of popularity across the globe, the quality of acting, sets, music, direction, writing and production value... i'm fairly certain there hasn't been anything quite like it in human history and i'm quite certain there won't be another in our lifetime...do watch it... and try to watch behind the scenes stuff so you can appreciate the details, effort and love that goes into every scene... check out the history and lore stuff as well that they release with the dvd every year... it'll give you some insight into history that gets left out from the books...and if you'd like to read possibly the greatest novel series ever written, do check it out... his style of narration with ambiguity, uncertainty and varying perspectives creates a world that is enchanting..."
2019-10-22,dragava,Shame.,1,"we almost couldn't believe our luck. here we had the beginning of this budding notion that the small stuff could rival the movies. at least technically. but it wasn't just technically sound. the casting was seemingly perfect. the writing was dangerous. and it even had the advantage of a preconceived world by an author who breathes the fantastical air as much as the characters he devised. it's strange to think about all that. about what we had. like sand slipping through the fingers the show,runners dropped all sense of an ending and the show felt a huge lapse in creativity and edge. we got what was easy, and easy is often plain. i always tell anyone who asks me if they should see the show (it is very few people who haven't), to simply do it. there is too much to unpack. for at least the first 4 seasons it was about the best thing on television. fresh fantasy viewing that has not been put to screen as competently since the lord of the rings. some of the best characters ever created, the best lines spoken, and the best battle sequences to have ever been brought to television. shame about the ending though."
2021-04-25,prr_rao,Entertainment beyond belief,10,"the story script so crisp and amazing which reads better than the book. i'm rating it 9 because of my own flaw of not finding any flaw in this imperfect world. severe nudity and violence, which generally i abhor, loved the perfect fit and relevancy in this flick. 73 episodes are the spoilers for me to enjoy any other tv serials."
2021-09-13,blakfox777,It's just a memory now.,8,"wanna know how much i loved this show? every time a new season came out, i'd watch the show from the beginning again. i had seen season 1 eight times when the last season was released.i will never rewatch this show again. honestly, most of the time i don't even remember it as a tv show, like if a friend asks me what shows i'd recommend or avoid, it doesn't appear in either a good way or a bad way.that is the worst possible feeling a tv show, or any form of art, can leave a person with: indifference.this show, which once had the best characters, music, worldbuilding, cinematography, everything,- is nothing more than a memory, to which i feel nothing but indifference, with a dash of disappointment.overall i rate it 7, because as i said-- everything about it was nearly perfect for a very long time. and even in season 8, everything except the writing was still nearly perfect. but the writing was just that bad.what a shame. what a waste."
2019-06-20,movietim14,"It's about the end, not the journey - Season 8 review",8,"game of thrones was on track for years to become the greatest tv show of all time. then season 8, its finale, happened. the writing of season 8 of game of thrones is an absolute travesty, not only for what it is on its own, but because it destroys everything that came before. i hear people complain about the series finale of ""seinfeld."" whatever a person's opinion on that series' ending is, it doesn't change the other 95% of the show, because it's filled with hilarious, stand,alone slice of life episodes.game of thrones on the other hand is a narrative show that was always building towards its end. for myself, the trite, cliche, poorly thought out and poorly executed character and narrative moments destroy any rewatchability the show may have had. this is more than an unsatisfying ending the likes of ""seinfeld."" season 8 effectively betrays everything game of thrones had been about: compelling characters with realistic human behavior, whose actions had real consequences in a world that felt real, with a deep lore, history, and political landscape. the plot was so riveting precisely because it was moved along by characters whose motivations and actions were every bit as real, unpredictable, and flawed as actual people.it's a shame then, both for the viewers and for the amazing production crew and cast, that a show defined by that has an ending defined by caricatures who merely exist and do whatever the plot requires of them in order to give itself an ending. in all honesty, that it had to end this way actually feels more like a slap in the face."

2020-01-01,gwenynamnam,BEST SHOW EVER PERIOD!!!!,9,"yes i write this after season 8! this is just the best show ever from start to finish in my opinion! the story, the acting, the music, the writing, the tension, the shocking moments, the entire world created...nothing can match game of thrones! but it's an adaptation from a series of books and it is so popular that it has a lot of pretentious viewers who are here to be the smartest and think they're writers. of course you can be disappointed because a character didn't end up the way you wanted or because you wanted 10 episodes in season 7 and 8, yes me too! but when i hear that the writing is bad and season 8 is absolute garbage i can't help myself to think that these people don't have any opinion at all or never really liked this show or didn't actually watched the last season! the disrespect this show had after it ended is just disgraceful, damn i hate (most) people!"
2017-10-04,someguyname,"If I rated with my emotions, this would be a 7",8,"i loved this show at the beginning, with the best episodes being those with joffrey on the throne. i realized through the slow pace, the naked chicks, the shock value torture and the irregular quality of acting, that this was to be considered light entertainment, but i still enjoyed the show. what it lacked in actual quality at times, it made up for as a cultural phenomenon , i still follow the show just because my friends do, and i love how it brings people together.the main issue is far too little material being stretched out over several seasons, and now, without george r. r. martin's plot to back it up, it has completely failed to keep the viewer's suspension of disbelief, and to build up any of the tension there was before. i did get afraid of jon snow dying at some point, because he couldn't realistically get out of the situation - but then he got saved in the most immersion-breaking way possible. it's not that i want more blood, only realism. if jon snow couldn't believably be saved and needs to be alive for the sake of plot, don't put him in an impossible situation to begin with. there are too many times in the late seasons where a character should've(realistically and tragically) died, but instead we get theon's personal victory at the beach, and other such fairy tales that lowers the stakes. game of thrones also doesn't feel like an actual game of thrones, when the victory of house of lannisters from season 1 still lasting, despite everyone wanting to kill them. also, what's so great about being on the iron throne, when a religious group can easily sway the idiotic peasants, and take away their power? i sure wouldn't want that kind of ""power"".the lannisters are my favourites, though, because they by far have the most interesting character arcs. my favourite is cersei, an alcoholic dumb - but wickedly sadistic - blonde, who wants so badly to be the scheming genius her daddy wanted; and what she does is basically failing at this over and over, and in the most hilariously karmic ways. in the end, she always has to resort to brute and dumb methods to get her way, and is on a constant quest trying to regain her dignity. she is the only character in which the drawn-out got-style works, because it's in line with her character to never amount to more. her love for her twin brother is interesting, the omen with losing all her children was great, and i love how she drunkenly snarks at everyone. best villain ever!i think cersei and early season tyrion showcases what got could be, but won't, because fewer seasons with tight writing and high-concept characters mean less money. there's too many scenes of people staring at fireplaces and repetitive conversations, that does nothing to plot or character development. i especially hate the character sam, whose version of ""character development"" is par for the course in got. so, he had book smarts and no courage at the beginning, and you won't believe what happens, he remains that way. i think well over five hours has been spent on him reading books and talking to scribes. seriously. he has beady eyes and rosy cheeks for personality, and he only looks like a real-life smart person, because he has a stupid, inbred wife(and that's the extent of her personality, btw).opening a can of worms, the much-debated misogyny: i personally find the ""got is misogynist because such were medieval times!""-excuse to be both simplistic, and ignorant of history. yes, i know that all the depicted things on screen really did happen, but hear me out! in the case of the character, ser loras tyrell, people reading this should look up on google images what medieval religious groups realistically did to torture gay men like him. after you have, ask yourself the question: do you think the inclusion of these rape torture devices would make a better show? would showing stuff like this graphically - like they do with women - give you a better understanding of the hardships of medieval times? or would it feel more like exploitative shock value?for the record, i'm not interested in seeing gay people further marginalized in got, and i don't wish all instances of misogyny on the show deleted. tyrell's sad fate was treated with taste, and it still got the point across perfectly. but why does got grab each and every opportunity there is, to show women being raped and degraded, when it clearly avoids giving the same intense/graphic treatment to other oppressed groups? why is it so hard to treat women the same? as a history buff, it's jarring to hear the ""back in the day"" argument, because women getting naked were not the situations in which the most gruesome happenings took place. more creativity, less misogyny, please. (and don't give me that ""men gets killed on the show, that is worse than rape!""-excuse - there are equally graphic deaths of women, and in this universe they even go to war - where do you see a huge outrage for that? ... yeah, that's what i thought)it saddens me to give it a 5, when i followed the show from beginning, and will follow to the end. but there's not enough quality and substance in the show to make it above average. it's a money-machine, and despite beautiful costumes and great production values, i still suspect that people twenty years from now will be left confused with it's popularity. it's cheap, it's opportunist, and quality-wise, it was already starting to die a long, drawn-out death several years ago, entertainment-wise."
2021-08-12,bulbulshakib,THE BEST SHOW ON EARTH TILL DATE,9,"this is more than a show. it's more like a journey.i'm not here to anything more about how this show is, because i don't i'll say anything new. every character development, every little detail of the story.. i don't know the words to appreciate this masterpiece. this is the only show where, after finishing season 7, i wished that i don't die before the final season. this is only show that i watched before my hsc examination, couldn't hold my excitement. the only show that gives me goosebumps every time i see a cutscene or footage on the internet. this is the best to me, that's all i know.i would rather put some points here why the last season is as great as any other seasons and i'm not disappointed at all, 1. got was never a show that goes by what the viewers expect. it has been always different from expectation.2. no matter how good daenerys was, she was the blood of mad king. it happened bc it had to happen.3. john never wanted the throne. he was never meant be the king on the throne, but the king beyond the throne.none of these might make sense to you. but it does to me. probably i'm in love with this show a little too much, i'm biased. probably no, i'm absolutely right."

2019-05-20,dameterpeter,"Perfect, most the way",1,"got was a series too perfect to be true. so it was.
what a beginning, what a story.
and what an ending indeed.
the quality of the series is splited in two parts: the better half of it was covered by books. without the books the tone changed into something more predictable, more generic ... stiff stuff. more pithy, badass one,liners, less story.
the quality declined from season 5 to the banal final season.
i guess there is a difference between an author and a screenwriter after all.
maybe this awesome series gets a well deserved (alternative book) ending from its creator one day, because tv-wise, it was boring.
every great story deserves a great ending."

2020-04-20,hsoarc,Sadly it took 2 season to affect the whole perception of the series,10,"while the show is godlike from 1,4, good to great 5-6, mediocre and bad 7-8; the fact that we come to realize how bad of a treatment most of these characters fate meet, the replay value is lost for me. example of this is the way nk is worked on as the most frightening entity in the whole thing and is dispatched in one single episode with the most anti climatic way possible and by that one character."
2020-04-06,mhdi-jr,An unrepeatable series,8,"i can't say much about this series. one of the best series in history, which scores excellent in all respects, only regretted that the events of the last season, although it could be said to be realistic and showed the result of the war for power, hurt it. of course, this ending was not bad for a lower series, but i expected more from the got. one of the sad things was the fate of john snow, who really didn't have the right to return to the wall as an exile after all this sacrifice. i will remember the series until the end of season 7 at the latest."
2020-05-16,yaols-95555,Game of Thrones,9,"not to mention the excellent production, perhaps the greatest significance of this play is to show a way to survive for the now declining magic theme movie and tv series. magic monsters are all floating clouds, a moving story, a group of characters with distinct and full character, a hazy but complete world view, is the king. what's more, as a literary adaptation, most of the fans also hold a praise attitude towards the play. amazing drama."

2021-01-05,ntnkapoor,GOT is GOAT,9,"king of all shows ,greatest on planet before 2020 i was a breaking bad fan and was my favourite show but now got is my favourite show by large margin . no show has such a great music , plot twists , story line and everything . this show is simply the perfect show.
many people get disappointed at end even i was but after rewatching everything made sense . ending was clear from the starting
by far all the shows i have seen this stays at top
(breaking bad , peaky blinders,true detective, the wire , the sopranos and many more)"
2020-06-24,triptisahu-21402,Ending was pathetic,6,"this was indeed a great show, it had everything plot, story, casting, acting and direction, but it actually destroyed everything in last two episode. it had potential to become the best, but it ruined it. and after watching the ending i am unable to watch even the previous season, i still wish if they could shoot those again and give it an epic ending."

season 8 was so awful that i can no longer call myself a game of thrones fan.season 8 introduced continuity errors and lazy writing. worse still, the central theme that was established in the very first episode of the series and built up throughout the whole show was concluded in the third episode of the last season in the most anti,climactic way i have ever seen!however, i don't think we should be *too* hard on season 8. after all, it has saved me hundreds of dollars on a blu-ray box set, merchandise and celeb autographs at conventions. i can't think of any other tv show that has saved me money by watching it.how i calculated my score:s1: 10

2011-04-25,jakimiku,Winter is Coming,9,"after watching the first episode i was so impressed and impatient that i decided to read the book immediately to see what happens next. then i thought that i should wait at least for a couple more weeks to see how the adaption goes before i write the review , i found no need because, hence small changes for the sake of the show, it is excellent.this show is amazing. the plot is very, very good and complex and has so many different layers that only it should keep people wanting to see what comes in the future. i won't even start with the characters: they are brilliant and so different that everyone should find someone to root for. and thanks to this being tv-series, we can have true and believable character development, something that many fantasy films lack these days. constant plot twists and sudden deaths are heartbreaking to say the least, but after every shock the show just manages to keep the grip on the viewers even tighter.the cinematography. nothing to say except praise. the medieval-like era and wintery aura give the story a grim and dark background, which suits, again, very well. the special effects are splendid, just take a look at the wall or the large cities, or the dragons and white walkers in the later seasons.the acting is very good as well. the cast itself is splendid, with most of it coming from the british theater scene. sean bean captures eddard stark impressively and peter dinklage as tyrion or newcomer kit harington as jon snow are just a few examples.after the fifth season the show will undoubtedly take a new path and will still have us waiting eagerly for the next episode. as for the show, just sit back, enjoy, and let yourself be taken over by this magnificent world."
2019-05-21,sophoclaw,Why the Hollywood way?,3,"i liked got quite a lot until j.r.r.martin stoped writing the series. it was a very noticeable phenomenon mostly because many of the characters began acting different from what they supposed to be from what martin had painstakingly developed through many years. not one of them was a stereotype, that is non of them was what we call a typical hero or a typical villain like in the hollywood jargon, no, they were more like human, sometimes they made good and great things and many times terrible mistakes, mostly they had a lot of flaws, like they were weak of character, violent, speculative, manipulative, treacherous, sadic, prejudiced, aggressive, vicious, etc. but hey that's precisely why got was great! and they killed each other but the series was constantly being replenished with new and exiting characters all the time so that there was plenty to take from and they could continue apparently to the end of time, but there exists another world, the world of reality and real human beings where the series were being created. it seems that martin could not cope with the tremendous pace of tv and the new authors couldn't find a way, things were rushed, suddenly the world of the realm got smaller, distances and times got shorter, the pace of destruction faster, the wave of new characters stoped, in able to end it sooner than originally intended they changed personality, like they thought it had to end in a ""normally"" human worldly way, but why the hollywood way?"
2018-06-24,vulture64,The Best,10,"put simply, the greatest tv series of all time. great cast, fabulous production, only flaw is they are 'dragging' the last couple of seasons out."
2015-06-03,linnet100,Season 5: the sad demise of GoT,10,"i'll declare my hand. up until season 5 game of thrones was comfortably the best thing i've ever seen on television. it had all the best ingredients. i would have reviewed all 4 seasons at, or very close to, 10.season 5 by contrast is a bitter disappointment and a marked deterioration in the brand. it's not just that it has become desperately slow moving, nor that so much of the first half is dialogue driven. it's also that the plot lines have become stultifying. great characters have become bogged down in, frankly, very boring stories: examples being arya, tyrion, daenerys and the dragons (who never seem to do anything). even the wonderful sansa has been sent to a backwater and, ironically, denuded ramsey bolton of much of his original interest. the two of them are stuck at winterfell, which would never happen (sansa's far too regal too have gone to the boltons as grr martin knew full well). the intrigue which surrounded king's landing has vanished in the face of really rather dull religious fanatics. so, for example, we've lost most of the wonderful lannister,tyrell friction. it's partly because we've lost the evil people with power such as tywin, but it's not just that. the series has become that most awful of adjectives: bland.a lot of this series comes across as shot hastily with poor scriptwriting and shoestring budgets. it's a bitter disappointment but a sign that perhaps game of thrones has had its day. i hope not because we're set for a grand finale, but the producers really need to get their act together and bring this back to form, and fast."
2019-04-15,asellusborealis,A game- changer... and I'm not even a big fan of fantasy,5,"game of thrones is simply unbeatable: there's no other tv show with such complex yet perfectly tied together story lines, unexpected twists (that actually make sense!), such well, developed characters, clever dialogues, amazing photography and ever better soundtrack.i'm sooooo glad got happened in my generation because i feel that this is a once-in-a-life time kind of thing. i'll be forever grateful to be experiencing this first-hand, as i assume future generations will not be able to appreciate the impact that this show has had on the tv industry and will inevitably talk about got in the same uninterested way ours does about ""cheers"" or ""upstairs, downstairs"", to name a few.got is a 10/10 for me. and again, this comes from someone who doesn't usually enjoy fantasy all that much."
2019-10-01,jjay37,Worst Ending Ever,5,"i have literally never been so absolutely disgusting in an ending like i was the end of this show, as the seasons kept coming they got better and better, i was hooked, i got so excited to see it each year, then the last season come, and it has put me off it for life, all them years wasted on one of the worst written endings ever, if george r.r martin had his say which i am assuming he didn't, actually we know he didn't have a say in the show and the writing, which makes no sense because it is his book, he should have had full power over the show, regardless if the books was out or not, he would still have had a vision, he would have known the ending in his mind, i have never, and will never watch the show again, or the spin offs, i'm not interested anymore, all the things i bought game of thrones, all the t shirts and everything i feel like i have wasted my money, i wouldn't reccomend anyone to watch this, not even the good seasons, because when you get to the end, you will have wasted all many hours on it, unfortunately for us we wasted years on the show. i would just not watch it. your better skipping the last season and making your own story up on how it ends."
2013-06-11,hoboss-511-909039,Fan since the very first hour,1,"i cannot understand why people talk about abomination and sex and why it is bad , when placed in context. wow. never happened in history before at all... so that's why we are all created by god and even should make political correct shows... wtf! omg. get real. it's fantasy... and i never was a fan of that genre. but what some people write here is just stupidity. i mean, referring to an iq of the people who watch a show to distract themselves and want to be entertained is just pure ignorance.for me it's one of the best shows ever made although i prefer the books. for me, as a native german, the books are harder to understand than the show actually is, but still. images come while reading. yet, i have to admit that the show/series is very close to the books and the pictures match.i always tell my friends if got would run for 24/7, i would take holidays for that.keep it going. looking forward to season 4, although i know what's coming."

2019-03-08,yodaschoda,Not a Bot!!! Swear! Simply Fantastic!,7,"if i were to present some form of video as representation of what kind of potential this medium has, it would be game of thrones. the writing is fantastic and poetic. the characters and casting are fantastic as well. even if they were to adopt the cocoanut clacking of monty python's holy grail for its coming final season, it would still merit a solid 9! but in all seriousness, the entire series from start to finish is simply amazing.it really does represent the pinnacle of the medium as a whole, and shows what can be possible when content meets substance. if only more series/movies took this approach... we might not see such a fading of its artistic applications."

When I Rate something on IMDb a 10, it's because I compare it to this show.",10,"so for you people that want to write reviews or just leave a review rating, just say this show is a 10 and compare that show to this. because this is a masterpiece. my father didn't ever like anything that could be fake, i showed him 1 episode and he was knowing more things about the show than i did and i loved it! for him to be into this show is like having a snake and mongoose being friends, unbelievable. that just shows the amazingness of this show. for someone that doesn't watch or is interest in fantasy or sci fi and actually love it. it shows a lot. i've been watching since i was 22 and my father at 54. so that shows that any age will love this."
2020-06-12,lukekeden,High Budget Trash,8,"yeah the costumes and set pieces look good, but really all the sex and battle scenes compensate for a lack of writing ability. i finished season 5 before i realised i was actively murdering brain cells by consuming this poison. i can't develop characters so i'll just kill them off or i need to fill 10 minutes of this episode why don't so and so bang."

season 8....... started fine, but the writing went downhill at an alarming rate, the actors are not to be blamed nor the cinematography etc just the writers they really did let every fan down badly by rushing potentially the greatest show there will ever be. instead the fans are left with a bitter taste and the sad realisation about what could have been if only there'd been 10 seasons."

2019-05-31,bijanadhikari,What went wrong?,10,"everything has been said about how bad season 7 and 8 turned out to be. and i don't see how i can write more than that already been discussed but this interview when breaking bad ended always lasted with me. so here is what i think went wrong for got summed up perfectly by a show runners who actually cares about his show.vince gilligan( breaking bad creator) on how he wrote the show : people think of writing as dialogue and but to me writing is structured, dialogue is cherry on top. the real story telling is how structural it all feels like by connecting every character. sometimes you think of a great scene, oh we really have a head on turtle and then have it blow off whatever but if you have to square pegs into round holes in order to get to that scene then you are doing it wrong. we questioned everything, we thought of every possibility but then we bet it against is it legitimate as to the characters forward momentum. we wanted to know where walt's head at and we applied to it every other character. we had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set piece scene that we thought had to be there but the characters dint wanted to do what we wanted to do. as a show runners your story line don't mean anything if you don't know where your characters head at. there's very little of what we wanted, it was mostly of what would he do next. it was always step by step what in this position knowing what we know about this guy what is his next move. balance of the show is taking him far enough, but not too far too fast."
2021-08-03,averylubocki,Season 1-4 is a must watch!,10,"seasons 1 to 4 are pretty much perfect. everything was at 100%. the writing was top tier and was complemented by some of the greatest performances in television history. season 5,6 noticed a slight dip in quality since they ran out of books to adapt. but the acting and the visuals were there to amaze whenever the writing faltered. i still really enjoyed them. season 7 was rushed. characters started to make very questionable decisions, and the story very slowly started to nose dive into... season 8. season 8 is disappointing to say the least. the acting, visuals and music were at 110% while the writers seemed to be operating at 10%. it feels like they just threw in the towel, which really sucks. however, the seasons that proceeded it are too good to miss. even if it didn't stick the landing, got is still a great show that i would recommend to everyone."
2017-03-20,beispsyd-18523,Broad Beginning,5,"the issue i have with ""fill"" being used too much becomes very pronounced when viewing such a great story line which is this show. hate to see too much dialogue used as a device to fill over content; see it in all shows. don'y know why has to be relied on so much, but does allow new plots to happen. thing is, the turns need to be believable... stark girl could get out of bad situation and leave with the hound, but stays. same with ""dwarf"" lannister, why leave and have something better. or, release of jaime lannister by mum stark....""huh?""or, other stark girl... could have ""three wishes assassin"" kill bad king, etc. but no. was even asked why, but conveniently, and unbelievably, dropped for new angle. but...everything but the obvious doesn't allow to shift thoughts. needs to be explained, not explained away.even with shades of ""token"", the added pain display and sex adds seasoning, but then becomes a mandate. perhaps so the ""brain dead"" show viewers (with modern age mentality)will watch. but perhaps they will think in spite of themselves...hum, a function of keeping a show series going i suppose."
2019-08-05,adityavora-20055,Not worth it . Dont waste your time,9,imagine the best season 8 ending in your head and live with it .. coz if you watch this you will be very disappointed. it's a poor storyline made with super graphics and cji etc etc ... not worth it ...
2021-05-23,adityavora-20055,Season 8 should be remade,5,so much could have been done with season 8but bran the broken is king with his 1 word answers .dumbest season i have ever seen .there is a limit to cruelty that a man can watch . eg jamie lannister. he is bad the good then bad then good then bad then good. i dont know what the f is going on anymore .there is now a new king slayer in town watch out . its sooo dumb that i feel like abusing every one who is in the seriesjust to create new twists in the series they did some pretty stupid things and made a good character into a stupid one eg emilia is now the mad queen . everyone else is unable to see how she is going mad .the smartest man is varysand the smartest dumb is tyrion lannister. is asking for forgiveness all the time after making dumb mistakes . i dont u understand why to write a story like that . keep it simple . make him the smartest hand that ever lived . why screw up his character . make jon snow to be the best turn around character . the secret was superb but they butchered it by making him go back to the walli mean i can go on forever . but it's just soo disappointing to see the last season.

2020-05-12,mattjackman92,An era defining show,8,"how sad the way got's ended. whatever you say about the truly awful climax, it can not be understated how amazing this show was. it was the pinnacle of tv and has left a big void which i'm sure many of us worry will not be filled again. if the show was one (maybe two) seasons shorter it would have been 10/10 from me and this review would be hailing it as the greatest ever tv show (albeit without an ending!). unfortunately, i feel the damage done by the awful conclusion will forever tarnish this monumental show.it has everything, from big,budget hollywood blockbuster scenes, intense drama, brilliant acting (peter dinklage is simply superb) and amazing scope. every episode draws you back into the land of westeros. the costumes, locations, set designs and music are all second to-none. even the opening credits are unmissable! it's crazy how much it made me care for so many characters and kept so many storylines running so smoothly.overall, i would recommend this show to anyone and everyone. it's brilliant and you will love watching it. just please enjoy it for what it is and try not to take it personally (as so many of us did) when it all falls apart at the end!!"
2019-09-03,elder_yautija,"I stopped caring after season 5, I stopped watching after season 7...",1,"... and dumb & dumber made sure i was right to do so.i will just say that the myriad of youtube videos that focus on tearing seasons 7 and 8 apart for how badly written they are, are way more entertaining and intellectually useful/satisfying than those seasons of the show. i recommend the pair of nitwits responsible for this once masterful adaptation's steady decline and untimely demise to go watch those videos and learn from their mistakes."

2019-11-01,mirkodreher,A show of ice and fire,6,"game of thrones was a total hype. every episode was topic in the lunchbreak for sure. it was not possible to not get spoiled if you didnt watch it right away. but not every season was that as goid as the last 3, and some episodes especially in the middle of the story were just not that great. also the ending kind of sucked. because of that i can only give 9 stars."
2020-03-03,arated-96629,It hurts to write this review,9,"what was once the best tv series slowly decended into mediocrity and then into pure trash.at least season 8 had amazing camera work and music like all seasons did.i cant say i would recomend, becasue to go through all of the hard (but amazing) times in early seasons just to get a wimpy ending isnt a good way to spend your time. the writers ruined what was a masterclass in tv. shame!"
2019-08-14,stefmuts,It ends how? Huh?,7,"it could have been a 10/10 if they just took the time to build up to this ending up to the final season this was an epic series, but instead of taking 2 or 3 seasons of 10 to build up to this ending they just cut it short, like they had enough and wanted it over with (?) they took years to build it up and just tore it down in the last season. i heard some fans want them to rewrite and refilm the ending and i can understand that but i don't think it ends bad, its just too fast with too many plot changes compared to the rest of the series"

2021-03-22,snowadian,Season 8 destroyed this series for me,10,"this series was one of the greatest series i've ever watched, right up to season 8. it wasn't that the last season was super rushed, or that the storyline didn't fit my expectations. my disgust with season 8 is that not a single storyline (and there were many in the series) had a proper conclusion. it is one thing to jolt viewers with an unexpected death, as got did throughout the series, it's quite another to not capitalize on 7 seasons worth of build up. if hbo re,did season 8, or better yet, did a new season 8, 9, and 10 - it would be a financial windfall for them.
i've never loved and hated a show so fiercely."
2019-05-20,cjza,unrewatchable,1,"it's almost too difficult to watch any of the early seasons now that i know how badly the final season was written.some of the best acting and cgi,etc i've ever seen , completely let down by writers who once they no longer had source material were incompetent.incredibly disappointed that they rushed what could have been a good ending into a few episodes and skipped all of the dialogue."
2020-02-16,bart-680,LOVE IT OR LOVE IT.,8,"i have unfortunately not read the books so i cannot compare the two. i have to say my hats are off on this one to the writers,
the story is so compelling and considering there is dragon scenes involved the cgi is immense, yes there is violence and scenes with nudity, if you can handle that that you will love it. crossed with vikings and the witcher, but in league of its own.

2020-11-04,kingjosh500,Didn't Stick the Landing,10,"first four seasons were arguably the best television ever. seasons 5, 6, and 7, the cracks began to show. the best parts of the show were adapted from the books. when they ran out of books to adapt, everything fell apart.the last season is so frustrating that i honestly wouldn't recommend watching the show at all (unless you're ok being epically disappointed)."

2019-05-25,warberg11,I wish I had written the last season(s),8,"starting out as a great show with high emphasis on quality dialogue, terrific world building at a low pace, but the sheer decline in storytelling, dialogue and realism from season seven and onwards is overly significant , albeit this will be mostly noticed by the book readers. i found some moments in the rushed last season to be really cringe worthy and insulting to the viewer. without spoiling what happened, a number of events played out in such cheesy ways that grrm always carefully evaded. however, casual viewers might still enjoy the entertainment in the last season. my dissatisfaction with the last season also doesn't take away that the show at earlier moments was magical with a great appeal. i will never regret watching the show and would recommend it to others. but a masterpiece? no, the series has lost that title in my regard."

2015-02-21,bks-508-290401,Can't get enough of this show,1,"i've never read the books so had no idea what to expect when i started watching this series. but everyone i knew who had read the books raved about them, so i wanted to see what the fuss was about. i don't know that i would've stuck with the books if i'd started those first, with some subjects, i find visual images more interesting than printed versions. i have to say, i'm officially hooked, and have just finished the fourth series. i've never been disappointed with most of the acting, some of the leads are particularly good. the people you're meant to despise do an epic job of making you feel exactly the right way. but then again, some of those i hated at first have now become my favourites, the character development has been excellent. i found some story lines truly shocking and upsetting, since i'd grown to really care about the people involved. it has a lot of fantasy elements also, which make the story even more interesting for me. the cg is really good and hasn't disappointed. the violence is quite extreme and very convincing, and has made me gag a little now and then, but it just adds to the realism. some of the sex scenes are also a bit gratuitous, but nothing i'd really complain about. there's only one main character who's got on my nerves to the point where i hate her scenes, she's so smug and self,entitled, but seems to be a favourite among fans. i'm hoping she either gets knocked off her high horse (or rather her dragon), or she develops some humility and grows on me. i'd highly recommend this show to anyone. i never believed i'd get so immersed, but i can't wait for the next season."
2021-10-06,oliviachape,Great for WOW fans,10,"very good, but not the best.at the time, ""vikings"" was a contendor. now, i would say i prefer tv shows like ""breaking bad"", ""dexter"", ""squid game"".i liked how there were different chess pieces on the board to this game of thrones. within the realm of fantasy fiction, this story is very successful.however, i believe they rushed the ending, like they had ran out of time."
2019-05-22,thielgirl83,The best series ever,10,"the acting is terrific. the story is filled with mythology, intrigue, and is executed flawlessly.
the imagery is gorgeous.
george r. r. martin based the song of ice and fire (the books are called that) on the war of the roses.
i want to mention one caveat, the showrunners, david benioff and d.b. weiss, ruined the last season.
it was the very worst series finale i've ever seen. they should be ashamed of themselves.
with that being said, it's totally worth the watch. once you see one episode, you'll be hooked."
2015-10-03,bencsik-laszlo91,This decade might be the renaissance of TV shows,10,"in my opinion, game of thrones has 3 major points that are responsible for the show's success.1. creating and exploring a whole new fantasy world george r.r. martin dreamed and the showrunners created a complex and diverse universe. the medieval atmosphere serves as a perfect base and fantasy elements were integrated into the events masterfully. the politics of westeros seems to be real and this huge world ensures inexhaustible resources, like: interrelated connections, family feuds, references to past events, different fractions, duels and battles, legends and beliefs, religious sects, mythical creatures and so on.2. there are no unequivocal characterswe receive complex and multifaceted individuals from different social classes with different goals. some of them have the power to achieve whatever they want, others can't even reach the simplest desires. social inequality does exist and power relations change constantly. characters fall from grace, others rise from the dirt and this insecurity leads to unpredictable events. we can't be really sure what's gonna happen next. smaller events sometimes evolve into the central storyline, so some actions that seem insignificant may have an aftermath later.3. outstanding verbal duels/ the weight of wordsmost of the scenes are basically conversations between characters in different places, but the incredibly talented actors and actresses are capable of maintaining (our) attention with well written dialogues. it makes time flow like a river. the show reflects genuinely on the consequences of verbal abuses. we witness fellowships and relationships vanish within seconds just by verbal communication. many characters took an insult too far, and sometimes a few words proved to be the main reason for war. it's interesting to watch friends becoming arch enemies and enemies becoming allies.all in all, game of thrones ensures qualitative entertainment for everyone and i'm pretty sure this series is a huge milestone in tv show history."
2016-12-03,fenrir_sleeps,"""A Song of Ice and Fire"" for dummies",8,"i gave up from watching ""game of thrones"" in the middle of its third season. the little fun that i had since i began following the series, even that little bit was lost for me. i realized that i was just watching it for the sake of watching it, because i've been reading the ""a song of ice and fire"" books. and life's too short to waste our free time on things that bring us no joy, so i'll just stick to the books from now on.long story short, i gave up from ""game of thrones"" because it made me feel dumb. i don't demand a show created for mass entertainment to have intellectual stimulation as its main feature, but, at least, i don't also expect it to be an insult to human intelligence. and that's exactly what i felt all the time while i was watching ""got"".there's that old saying, ""the film is always worse than the novel"", right? the main problem of ""got"" is the way they don't just simplify the plot from the novels (which was unavoidable), but they also dumb down what they simplify, to turn the series' argument, i assume, 'accessible' for the average tv viewer. it's literally ""a song of ice and fire"" for dummies.after i read the first book of the novel series, and then watched the first season of ""got"", when i picked up ""a clash of kings"" (the second book of the series) and while reading it, i could get in on ""got"" writers' minds, and guess which parts of the novel would be picked to be put on screen. basically, everything that features violence or black comedy (which in the books don't detract the story, but only helps to define it), is amped up in ""got"", and the tv series' plot is built around individual, shocking scenes, to grab the ""average viewer"" by what instinctively impresses the human mind the easiest.i'm recalling the scene when tywin lannister is appointed hand of the king, in a ceremony on the throne's room and the horse on which he's mounted makes a dung while the hand of the king's pin is being placed on his lapel. while in the book the scene goes just like this, a fine touch of english,like humor, of political satire in the story, in ""got"" they decide to open the hand of the king's ceremony scene with a great plan of tywin's horse fresh dung, and then film him going while he trots in the throne's room. as everyone understood the joke? or maybe they should have made a great plan of the horse's butthole while he was making the dung, just to make sure everyone got it.to all this mind-numbing sort of explained anecdotes, and to their analogue for the violent scenes, add a cast mostly composed of bad actors, who most of the time are trying to fit in their characters so hard, that they make every scene and dialog seem made-up and artificial (exception made for peter dinklage as tyrion lannister), and you have here a really cringey tv show. for the ones who find valor and amusement in ""game of thrones"", i feel great for you, but i guess that, for me, this isn't just my cup of tea."

2021-09-19,josephmayes,Imagine a Ballerina dancer...,10,"...and i do mean the best damned dance you've seen. one whose leaps around in these beautiful twirls and a near perfect execution. these dances well integrate with the set around them, the backgrounds characters aid in the mystical performance. and when that dancer finishes with a split, their legs give out further than anticipated, creating an unbelievable pain in the crotch and the dancer screams mutually as the audience and crew abroad stares in shock and disappointment.that's my thoughts on game of thrones in a nutshell. an excellent performance with a terrible ending. some people like i do will remember this brutal masterpiece of a show fondly...but we all remember how it ends. instead of an excellent, satisfying conclusion, all we got was a harsh reminder of the phrase: ""pride comes before the fall."""
2017-09-27,ruhsa,This TV series is magnificent,9,"with an average score of almost 10/10 from almost 1 million users, do i even need to write a review? oh well, why not?no tv series or movies can be compared to got. in many bs movies/shows you can predict the ending after watching it for a few minutes (good ones always win and the bad ones seem to be completely retarded, blind, and incompetent. well, not anymore!!!the story in got is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events.acting is great, costumes and scenery as well. every character is unique and interesting, and its great watching them develop. everything is top quality. if you start watching this, be prepared to get addicted quickly , you'll just feel a strong urge to watch the next episode, and another, and another until no more episodes are left. and finally i want to say that the series is really wonderful at all, and the soundtrack has been a genius and has contributed significantly to the perfection of the series."
2019-05-21,pvsteijn,"This hurts, but must be done.",10,"3 years ago, i would've told anyone this was the best show ever made. it was, no doubt about it. the first 5 seasons are absolutely brilliant. stunning visuals, an absolutely fantastic cast and thanks to the books, the best dialogue and writing ever to grace television. season 6 was still amazing, however that's where it took a turn..season 7 is where it started to drop. characters were acting.. out of character more and more, people could seemingly teleport all over the world and the once cunning dialogue seemed to have faded quite a bit. then came a 2 year gap with the 8th and final season, which, i feel, made a lot of people forget about the slight disappoinment that season 7 was. huge hype and anticipation was utterly crushed by probably the worst ending i have ever seen. the quality did not just continue to go downwards, it plummeted and crashed into the ground.it's still visually stunning, the music is still breathtaking and the production quality overall is just mindblowing , except when it comes to writing. 7 seasons if storyline were butchered, including the main villain and basically all of the main characters. it wasn't a factor of me not agreeing or me not being 'happy' about it - they literally destroyed their storlyines and made them act like different people whilst all they, and therefore we had gone through, meant nothing. it's been extremely painful to see such decline in what was genuinely the best thing to grace television. i truly believe that.i'll still give it a 7. the first few seasons are without a doubt the best you'll ever see. but if you missed out or come across this in 10 years time when the next generation will find out about this phenomenon: know that the ending and the whole last season are an utter disappointment an ruin it all."
2020-07-04,vkikherii,It's a TEN. That's it.. Nuff said. H8TERs be gone..,10,"got is a masterpiece that makes lord of the rings look like a fantasy movie from dr seuss. i unapologetically rated this series a 10 even when some people demanded last season remake because it didn't suit their taste. the thing is, got is so unpredictable therefore dany's falling into madness in the last season was actually targaryen business as usual (mad king, anybody?). i liked it when she torched the city like a mad god (or rather like the god from the old testament who destroyed sodom and gomorrah in a similar fashion) from above. finally when jon got to hug dany, i somehow knew instead of jack and rose's titanic moment, jon was gonna show his undying love to dany in a much more unique way. this is a pure cinematic gold at its best or call it poetic justice if you will.rather than season 8 remake, i'd rather see they make prequels or perhaps sequels. can't get me enough of thrones..."

until the very ending, when the creators of the show destroyed everything we loved in just one episode, as if it was on purpose...
so don't do it! avoid the pain!"

3. has great sword fights.
4. has the greater characters in the whole world.
when i was done watching this show, i legit felt depressed. i had spent so much time with these characters that i don't want to see them go. unless the dragon in the end took daenerys to a place that she could be revived and then she wrecks havoc on the world, which they won't do, there is no way i will ever see these people again. be prepared to be depressed once you finish."
2019-05-22,colbertmark-65901,My conspiracy theory,10,"corey feldman has gone on and on for a long time about the people in hollywood abusing young actors, and that one day they'll be outed.well i have a conspiracy theory about the got final season. months before the season came out, several full scripts appeared, with very different storylines to what actually eventuated. back in 2018 betting agencies started listing betting for the final season. at first, the bet 'who will rule the iron throne at season end' had bran as favourite (and he remained there for the majority of the time), but a close second was 'jon snow's child'. he didn't even have a child. but a script that was here there and everywhere said dany died during childbirth (jon's child), and that child ruled at season end.now these betting agencies prove over and over they know the outcome of any tv show, they repeatedly give away who will win wwe matches, and who will win shows like the bachelor and survivor, before they've aired. so they definitely knew something if they had an odd selection like bran as favourite from the beginning.my theory is, we got such a terrible ending, because some naughty dealings were going on behind the scenes, making a lot of people rich.let's see if this review gets posted!"
2018-11-11,jabbathehans,Political Fantasy Full Of Intrigue (Watched All Seasons Except The Last),8,"game of thrones is revolves about certain characters vying to get control over the fictional world, and the domino effects those desires have created, driving the whole story forward. the story is mainly set in a world similar to the european middle,ages, but with magic.game of thrones has a lot of characters that i cant even remember the names of 90% of them. because of the huge world, the story is expected to be usually dragging during the first half of the season as it tries to set-up the final episodes-- which i will tell you are truly magnificent! even the earlier seasons are set-up for the grand final season that will surely be one of the best final episodes in the history of modern television series.if you are a fan of shows that deal with politics, fantasy, family, drama, and intrigue, you definitely need to see game of thrones."
2020-02-07,alchemist-77127,The ending did not suck,2,"people only dislike the last season cause it does not deliver the predictable sweet ending that comforts them. it is not a story of how it is supposed o be, it is a real ending. the story and actions maintained their excitement till the end. the pre,last episode wherein the dragon completely destroyed kingslanding was cruelly awesome... the last episode was a political statement. jon snow killed daenerys to prevent a mad ruler become the new terror and he was right. the choice that bran becomes king is not an option the fans wanted but completed the story because he would be the one ruler who maintain the dull and peaceful period they all need right now. not what you expect, but complete when you really think about it. this series is the best ever!!!"

2019-06-01,rozsnyaib,Great beginning worst ending,3,"game of thrones was fantastic at the beginning. it was that kind of serie that noone knew what was gonna happen. it had turns, great acting characters and an enjoyable story to watch. it was, till the last season. it kinda messed up the whole story and i thought something bigger gonna happen."
2019-05-31,snkhan-27905,Season 8 - What the F!!!!,7,season 8 is the reason for the 1 star. it's like the creators had no interest or ran out of ideas for the last 2 seasons since it wasn't based on the books. the most pathetic ending to one of the best series!
2020-07-16,josephf-05083,Had the potential to be the best,10,"game of thrones is by far the greatest thing i've watched but it could have been so much more if not for that last season. d&d really let us down with that last season, it just didn't feel right, felt rushed, thought the cinematography in the battle episodes was amazing but they built it up for 8 years only for us to be disappointed by the outcome of the series. i mean come on who else wanted to see jon snow as king and not bran, it makes 0 sense as to why he became king as he stated earlier on in the season that he is ""the three eyed raven"" and that he ""can't be king"".
i think it would have been a good idea(for the viewers of game of thrones) if we got a spin off season dedicated to jon snow or all the starks as it would be interesting to find out about what arya's doing west of westoros or how sansa and bran are doing being lords and lady's and most importantly what jon is going to be doing now since he has been banished to the knights watch.
anyway these are just my thoughts and what would be good for viewers and what we are owed as fans of this show and my dislike for the final season (more or less the very last episode)"
2020-10-30,oreddish,Mixed feelings.,9,this show has the greatest start of anything i've ever seen. they proved that you can make characters that we love and still have them do things that shock our conscience. the ability to turn bad people into good was remarkable! and the early dialogue was nothing that has ever been done on screen before.season 5 and 6 is where the turn began. the show was still great but it had lost the edge that put it as the greatest show ever.by season 7 all was lost. the story imploded. the dialogue was cheesy. and there was a number of writing blunders. also particularly in season 8 the battles were completely wonky in set up.when i think back on got i get so happy that i got to experience such an incredible show. but i'll never watch it again as the decent down in the later seasons is too hard to bare.

2020-05-30,yls-27389,Game of Thrones,10,"the play is an absolutely fascinating example. it's a bit boring to watch the first few episodes every season, and then the more you watch, the better you look, and finally you can't help yourself"
2020-07-23,kbscrank,Not the Greatest TV show ever made but great,10,"i wasn't into the hype around game of thrones...but decided to give it a whirl a few years back... despite everyone else's opinion i found season 2 boring...however the season prior and the four seasons after are golden. 1,3,4,5,6 amazing tv.i found that very few characters stuck out in terms of development however, arya stark was the shining star in that case. when the whole dispute happened it went downhill. season 7 was badly rushed that it could no longer claim to tbe.season 7 was farcical tbh it started becoming bad tv even though it's fan base remained loyal and defended it.season 8 pulled it back in terms of realism but again it was rushed and put together sloppily.in the end it lost its soul"
2020-07-09,siddhesh02,"Disagreeing to the idea of ""bad final season""",8,"most of the people are unhappy with the last season. but i would say it was the only best ending possible ending got could have.
if you go by actual human history
its alway best, if great things come to end before it becomes great destruction and for new thing to enter.its also kind of natures law. best example would be the fact of non,existence of dinosaurs.
it will alway be my life times most fav series."
2019-05-20,jonathanraven1980,Began wonderfully. Ended horribly. What an atrocity. Never buying anything GRRM again.,8,"i'm disgusted. horrified and disgusted. this show ""was"" amazing. i read the books. loved them. i have been a huge fan for years. until now. i'll never buy anything grrm writes again. i'll never subscribe to hbo or buy anything of theirs. never. the show was amazing. but with each season, things deteriorated. characters in the final season did not seem in character at all. everyone acted out of character.the final episode was the single most boring episode ever, when it should have been the best.jon snow was built up to be the king, and they throw a cripple with a dumb storyline on the throne, and exile jon snow.arya is built up with a wonderful arc, and just tossed away stupidly, after her dumb scene killing the night king.jamie is killed dumbly protecting cersei.sansa is built up, dumbly... and to no avail. oh wait, she becomes... queen of the north, i guess? in the last seconds... okay...the battle with the dead was stupid, and lasted one episode. it was glorious to watch, but had a dumb ending, with a little girl killing the night king. so yes in a way arya had a purpose. but it was stupidly executed.and they had the little girl queen kill a giant, stupidly.the show and books got worse after robb stark was killed. up to that point, this series was astounding! the best of its kind. really there was nothing like it. nothing as good. but then grrm had to do that who ruin your expectations thing, and in doing so, ruined the story."
2020-02-17,harcarmichael,Very Good Show,7,"if you have the time to invest, you probably won't regret watching it since all of its entertainment values are truly top notch. however, it failed to claim the goat title due to many blunders during its final few seasons, especially seasons 7 and 8, basically they milked it at the end for all it was worth for commercial success, and turned it into a hollywood blockbuster that was dumbed down.it's not that the first six seasons were without flaws, either. it was always a little bit overrated, but it is definitely a great tv show, especially relatively speaking. i would put it in the top 5 non-comedy series of all-time. it just needed a better and more coherent ending. dany should have unquestionably won and claimed the throne and even if she didn't, it should have been better."
2014-03-11,xecutionrecords,An Alternative To Popular Opinion..Read On If You Dare!!!,10,"ok if you are reading this i am guessing you are one of those super fans who can't get enough of game of thrones & like wallowing in your appreciation of this despicable sorry excuse for tv fantasy drama. as you can tell i am not one of you. game of thrones has so many good reviews & such glowing praise as to make me wonder if the whole world has fallen asleep or alternatively hooked up to some matrix,like hive mind channelling this drivel through a tube placed carefully up your backside, can so many people be so wrong? well the answer is yes obviously. to critique this show in a sour way is tantamount to treason i am sure but i am british & trust me it is ok to voice your opinion in a negative way despite the whole world wanting to spit venomous bile in your eyes. i have like most of you, watched every episode of it & although you will rant that i have a choice not to watch it or to plainly just go away, i, like a lot of people these days like watching tv shows & be they bad or good it is always good to watch the things that everyone is talking about (and talking about, and talking about) so i carry on in the vain hope that one day i'll switch this show on & something will actually happen but instead i get b grade british actors talking about 'the wall' or saying things like 'something awful is coming' or 'let's shag!' & on & on, talking, more talking & waiting & waiting, always waiting for something to happen, has anyone noticed that nothing has happened in this show for the last 2 seasons? oh but there was a big battle! yes there was except we missed most of it as we were watching the women hiding below talking some more. oh but there was 'the wedding' yes there was, 5 minutes of action tabbed on the end of one of those lengthy talky episodes (you know the ones) 'wow so radical, killing off some of the main characters in such a ghastly manner, no one has done that before' give me strength!! game of thrones is like a really bad carrot, like the ones you always throw away to get a better one in the grocers, and the viewers are like ageing donkeys continually following it around until you are so accustomed to doing it that you just carry on regardless, yes i am one of them, i've been suckered as well!, i admit it but by always tossing out the promise of dragons i persevered anyway & now i am at a point that i am writing a review about it, not because i like the bloody thing more because i am sick of these endless reviews praising it's 'boldness', it's 'genius', it's 'lord of the rings-ish-ness.' my god people, what version of lord of the rings have you seen? the one i watched was majestic, action packed, sad, uplifting, funny & the real definition of genius. not this pile of puss spewing troll bile that passes itself off as fantasy, if anything its more like playboy channel soft core porn than epic fantasy, obviously one of the main reasons its so popular. of course you will tell your girlfriend/boyfriend your watching it for the breathtaking dramatics or epic storytelling (because of course it has both of those..cough..choke!!) so you will go on watching it telling your friends how amazing it is, how shocked you were by it etc etc but deep down you all know the truth, that this is just a low level generic hybrid of the red shoe diaries, dr quinn medicine woman & the recent crap conan movie. in years to come this will be joked about, like in one of those tv shows that reminisce about the 80's or 90's with a headline like 'how 10 million people could be wrong' & you'll sit there & laugh to yourself in a sad 'i wasted my youth' type way, you will finally realise after years of trailing after the carrot that nothing is going to happen in this show, you'll be left with one last talky exposition scene (whilst a battle rages on somewhere else, presumably somewhere they can't take the cameras) everybody will sit round the throne & toast with fine wine & grapes, there will be singing & dancing & orgies (of course) and maybe if we are lucky, one of the dragons might take a dump? seriously if people don't start waking up soon i worry about the world, i mean reeves & fishburne are way too famous now to give a toss so save yourselves. there are much better shows out there to obsess over, much better fantasy books to read, much much better fantasy films to watch & certainly way better porn! but of course if watching evil characters twirl their moustaches & cackling behind peoples backs whilst masturbating over incestuous kin doing the humpty dumpty is your kind of thing, there is at least one scene like this every couple of episodes so knock yourself out. oh and of course you will get the promise of dragons just at the moment your thinking about switching off & watching re-runs of breaking bad instead... awful tv, watch lord of the rings again, that might wake you up my matrix loving friends. game of thrones, enjoy your stay of execution but one day your head is going to be lopped off just like the only good actor in your show... by the way if you are thinking i am a troll, i'm not, trolls are fictional beasts that usually turn up in decent fantasy shows along with goblins & dragons, all of which do not feature prominently in game of thrones!"
2019-05-20,faeez_rizwan,After 8 Years,1,"i writing this review right after the finale. i gave it a perfect 10 for season 1,7. i'm not gonna downgrade it to 9 just because of season 8. true, it was really disappointing, but got was one of the best tv series ever created.thank you for all the fun and dramatic experiences you have given me for the past eight years. i really love this show and i believe it'll stay in my heart and memories forever."
2021-03-26,wellyforpm,It sure starts out well....,1,the first 4 seasons are some of the best television has to offer. they are ruined because a little girl has a tantrum that her nephew won't engage in intercourse with her.
2019-09-15,jke_up,"I loved the show, and rated it 10/10. Up until season 8....",7,"i loved the show up until season 8. i think season 6 is easily the best season. i thought season 7 was awesome when it came out in 2017, but as i rewatched all seasons before season 8, i realised that season 7 has a lot of the same misses and mistakes as season 8, however not nearly as bad, still one of the best shows ever around, and still very recoverable.in short, this show needed both season 7 and 8 to be full 10 episode long seasons, and the show probably required at least another season on top of that, a 9nth season, in order to end on a good note.i dont how to explain this without spoilers, but season 8 just sucks, in every way. honestly, the issue isnt just that it is 6 episods long, the way these 6 episodese were made is bad as well. there is a very good youtube video in which a person gives their own version of season 8, how he thinks eveything should have happened, even within the constraints of 6 episodes. and it is so much better than what is actually in the real season 8.the show is overall still one of the best shows ever for the first 7 seasons, but i have to bump down my score just by how terrible the ending of this series is."
2019-06-11,mmjnr10,I'm only giving those 8 points based on the previous seasons!!,10,i wasn't going to write anything about this series simply because i got so heart broken by the terrible ending that never touched my wildest dreams but in a negative way!! if you tell me a year back i would rate this series anything less than an 10 i would've considered you crazy beyond repair but now things has changed and an 8 is a compliment in comparison to the total let down that i recieved from season 8!! thing is i would've been ok with finishing off the white walkers in one dark episode and if the last two episodes concluded in a decent rational manner i would've accepted the season despite its multiple flaws but to end it the way they did in the last two episodes is pure murder to us viewers and to the name got has created for itself through sheer brilliant story telling and execution at the highest level.. there is no need to go on further because after reading a few comments i was aware that it's an almost universal feeling that season 8 was such an ugly shocking let down that one has to live with... wish they could work on an alternative ending like some movies do and give us all the ending that we crave for with a good pinch of humility and optimism maybe that could heal things a little
2019-05-13,deleonmoshe,Never encountered such bad stupid clumsy writers,10,"after 5 episodes of season 8 , i simply refuse to believe such bad writing is allowed by hbo management. they should take personal responsibility and quit, all of them!no more hbo for me.unless they all quit!"

2019-02-12,splosh3,1s and 2s. Really?!,1,"quick review of got is, it is fantastic, probably will be regarded as one of the best series' in history. the story of this show (while differing in places to the books) is an epic tale of fantasy in a medieval setting.
the scale of this show and effort put into it puts a lot of high budget hollywood film's to shame.
i applaud david benioff and d. b weiss for creating this masterpiece.rant time:
now on to all of the people who have tried in vain to make this show go under a 9. i cannot comprehend why any person is rating this show a 1 or a 2. the cinematography and effects alone make that objectivly wrong, to anyone with eyes.
i felt physically bad reading people say this show has no story or substance, or worst of all, that it's boring. i understand that people may not like this show, and that's fine. but some of he arguments these people give tells me they have no brain cells."

2017-07-25,zidwaters,Too good,1,it is too good to explain in a review just watch it! its too hard to explain i tried to write a long review about it but i realized it got to much. this is by far the best series i have watched till now and i love medieval and fantasy so this was perfect for me. the series has epic large scale battles and horrific massacres and they do all the scenes amazing.
2017-08-10,onelovemustsurvive,Truly Phenomenal,2,"i'm going to preface this review by stating that i usually dislike medieval,themed shows. this show really is like no other. even though it started off slowly, it has cemented itself as one of the best shows of all time. i have been watching it since the second season and i have loved it ever since. even when the episodes seem like they are dull and go on for a very long time, they have a purpose and are always well-done. this show is excellent in every way, from the acting, the writing, the cinematography, the score/music, it's absolutely wonderful. it's filled with interesting, complex characters and situations that are introduced every season. it somehow remains fresh and constantly surprises and impresses me every season. even though some people may see it as overrated, it's still an undeniably excellent show, regardless of your personal preference. it manages to be hilarious, heartbreaking, interesting, intriguing, and dark all the same time. whilst this show may not be ideal for those who have read the books, i imagine it is still fascinating to see these character and this vast world come to life. there's something in this show for everyone; fans of practically every genre can appreciate the hard work and art the cast and crew produce that is evident in every episode. the first season may seem confusing and overwhelming to take in at first, but after you manage to sit through it and watch how all the different plot lines and characters progress, you'll realize how crucial the first season was and how great it actually was. the character development and acting, not to mention the superbly done special effect, are what really stand out; and for good reason. give this show a try and be part of the ever-growing fan-base or just check out what all the fuss is about. however biased it may sound, this really is the best show i have ever had the fortune of watching over and over again. i hope many more continue to appreciate the overall greatness of the world george r. r. martin has created."

2019-05-25,tosifm,Amazing,9,i don't understand the why there is so much hate for season 8. everyone knew this was the last season and the maker had to close the story. and honestly i never wanted a happy ending for such a great show. for me this was the ending i was expecting and it closed in the best. felt sad to see the ending though.
2019-06-05,airsnob-18715,This WAS the greatest show ever on tv.,10,"i loved got. i thought this was one of the greatest shows i had ever watched , one of the greatest stories ever told. whatever. up till season 8, this might be true.
at season 8, the show pivots.
it isn't the dragons, the dead zombies. or the little children that become the fantasy.
see this show had so much about it that made it what it was. that made it cross over to a wide range of people, places etc..
i think the characters were so beloved and the story was so beloved that at season 8, when the writers thought they could take it all and smash it again, it didn't work. it didn't make sense. and it doesn't matter if there was a fantasy aspect to it , we needed the characters to make sense, to ring true.
season 8, became a lie.
nothing made sense.
beloved characters started making no sense. the writers started pulling our legs, trying to be funny. trying to shock.
basically season 8 everything took a dump and the writers really started trying too hard. trying too hard to make an impression and trying too hard to entertain and shock us and come up with the same shock and awe of the previous seasons - but they didn't have the author or his story to relay on anymore and it shows.
nothing made sense.
season 8 becomes so shockingly sexist and stereotypical , when it really wasn't trying to. in fact i wager they thought they were doing something revolutionary. but in the end, after several seasons. it just became a lie.
this guy can forgive anyone and every man gets redemption- no matter the awful deeds they do. in fact men can commit atrocities and become better people! but not women. . you can tell the writers are religious.
the show becomes so shockingly bad and the ending is just about the most awful series of choices and decisions on the part of the writers - that the entire show doesn't deserve its high rating anymore.
i hope everyone comes back and changes their initial vote ( take your 10 and turn it into a 2) so that the rating can accurately reflect the show at this point.
that ending ruined the show.
i'm sorry but got isn't the same show.
the ending has forever altered it. ruined it.
when i think of watching the show over again, i can't. i don't want to. why? because i know how it ends. and the ending is terrible.
it isn't worth it anymore.
as a huge fan of the show i didn't even watch the last episode. i never will.
it's that bad guys.
we all need to show how horrible this ending was.
the writers deserve it.
change your vote!"

2021-02-13,milicalusimp,I love it,1,"i'm 16 and i just started watching got, i love it it's very well made but i have to say that it has a lot of violence."
2019-06-03,jeremycorbyn,There should be no place for this show in civilised society,1,"game of thrones overall has decent acting, mediocre dialogue and lovely beautiful settings. the story and characters on the other hand, as well as the insidious message the show dishes out to the viewers, is absolutely awful. i'm still infuriated that they allowed a lovely female female character to be sexually abused onscreen, i had nightmares about sansa suffering from ramsay for days on end after that. ramsay himself even sexually abused me in my dreams afterwards, those nightmares traumatised me. this show is just too brutally nasty for me. i'm also disappointed in the lack of black people in this tv show, the show lacks diversity and the fact there's hardly any black characters in it shows that it's also unrealistic.i understand this show is set in a medieval world and whilst the medieval world had far less rights for women and was more violent, i don't think that should be replicated realistically in fictional tv shows in this civilised day and age. it might be unrealistic for a fictional medieval tv show to have the average woman as powerful and as rich as the average man and for them not to give brutal death penalties for criminals but that way at least it would be more closer to our current time and frankly considering how terrible medieval history is i think people could do the world a favour by not talking about those years ever again and forgetting about it completely. this show could've been great if it focused on chivalrous honourable knights making love to beautiful princesses with equal power for both genders. i'm thoroughly disappointed in this show, overall i don't recommend this show to anyone."
2021-05-04,aidan-36288,GoT was fantastic,9,even though the final season was rushed it is still a fantastic show. i would recommend it to anyone who loves a show with a great story!!!
2019-06-06,florinc,"S1-7 almost perfect, S8 Holywood stupidity",10,"what is to be added to what is already written? i only want hbo to understand the very very low product s8 is. one of the lowest i know: broken plot, broken seasons, useless cg, the very few unexpected deeds were indeed poorly designed, developed and acted. it is as if some college kids did it. not apity, but shame."
2019-05-23,mirkoacquaviva,Perfect show ruined by bad writers,10,"this show needs no introductions, one of the best shows with an interlaced and unexpected plot that sadly went nowhere cause the writers only had every plot point up until mid season 5. until that point they managed to adapt ""a song of ice and fire"" by g.r.r. martin very well and even seasons 5/6, that had no source material, were still pretty good if you glance over some major character assassination in the dorne plot. by season 7 the show started to decline, characters started doing things just to progress the plot and not because they a reason behind it and we start to see the first appearence of plot armor that constantly saved our heroes but overall was still above avarage television. season 8 was a total mess, stuff just started to happen because the plot said so and if felt very rushed, the plot armor thickened and character developement took the back seat in favout of spectacle and bringing the plot to an end.overall i give it an 8 because the first 4 season are up there with the best shows and even though the writing went really bad in the final seasons the cinematography, sets, costumes and the acting still were top notch. it's really sad just because this could have easly been a 10/10 show if the writers didn't rushed the last season (that took 2 year to film/write) or gave the project to someone more talented and involved with the books that could have gave the show the ending that we all deserved after 9 years."
2019-04-22,felixmh,"What the hell were they thinking? A ""recap episode???""",10,"this is episode 2 out of 6. the first episode was kinda meh, the show,runners wasted a lot of time on stereotypical hollywood fillers you would expect from a second-tier police procedural, but sure, a little reunion here and there wasn't totally superfluous.however, episode 2 is like a badly written version of episode 1, and unexpectedly took the use of fillers to a whole new level, a level unacceptable for got. the writers must have really run of ideas to do what is essentially a clip show. again, this is something you would expect from the last season of friends or the office when the main characters would sit around and reminisce about ""remember when you did this and i did that, those were the days, and we've all grown so much since then."" and arya, are you kidding me? even though it was foreshadowed like crazy in episode 1, i still had some hope they wouldn't completely destroy years of character development with one gratuitous scene. my god, what a waste of an episode, the sand snakes don't look so bad now.well, at least we can expect a cgi battle next week, i guess we'll see how it goes, but i honestly didn't expect the show to deteriorate to such an extent this season."
2012-07-02,flemur13013,Pretty boring,9,"spoilers probably.it's mostly people in funny clothes gossiping about other people in funny clothes. like the books! and they show people talking about action, rather than showing the action.which means they could skimp on the sets.i watched a couple of episodes and wondered when they'd show a ""wight"" , then discovered that the ""wight"" was that tall guy in a long coat: i wish i'd known he was a wight, because then the tall guy in the long coat might have been scary.it's too diffused, too many uninteresting sub-stories going on and too many characters who never seem to do much of anything. except gossip about the other people who also don't do much of anything. like the books!"
2016-10-31,roswellfan,Both Good and Bad,10,"""game of thrones"" is basically about four families involved in battles for the throne of the kingdom of westros. they are: the starks, a northern family, honorable and good; the lannisters, cunning and ruthless (tyrion being the exception, a good and clever man); the baratheons, now practically extinct with the end of season five, and the sole survivor of the targareons, daenerys.this last one is the daughter of the one known as the mad king. he was overthrown by a coalition of the above three families. she is currently building an army to retake the iron throne and in addition has three dragons to aid her.there are various plots and subplots that keep the viewer guessing and often unexpected twists and turns. so far after the five seasons i have seen, this has kept the series interesting.the acting is very good, and i do not recall one bad performance. peter dinklage is especially excellent as tyrion lannister, making tyrion the best character in the series. from season one, he immediately makes the character connect with the audience.for a tv series, the special effects are well done and the computer generated images are mostly good. add to that the great scenery, and an atmosphere is created that helps move the story along.that was the good, now for the bad. there is excessive violence and cruelty. considering that got is emulating a violent period in history, one can accept the violence, but the cruelty no! children being crucified and burned alive adds nothing to the story. especially the scene where stannis baratheon has his little daughter burned alive while she pleads to him and her mother, this scene was extremely disturbing! it just ruined the fifth season, and what did it really add? it only made me want to abandon the series!then, there is the writers' tendency to kill off or maim the heroes. yes, i know that in real life heroes die and get maimed, but this goes to excess! also, one does not watch and read fiction for reality. for that, one turns to the news!with these criticisms considered, i wonder if got will end on a dark note, with evil triumphant. if it does, it will surely make the entire series meaningless.i am rating ""game of thrones"" a seven, if not for the above flaws i would have given it a ten."
2016-08-04,mohsin-mohsin6,Most Addicted TV series ever mad in history ....,1,"i have vote this series as 10/10 because it really deserve . without further ado let me describe some prons and cons of the seriesprons:1.graphic is excellent without a doubt they spend a huge lot of money to make this incredible series . 2. storytelling is more than perfect. the most amazing thing about the series is you can't expect what comes next and if you tried to predict you jaw will open soon. 3. casting . the best casting i have seen . every character play their role perfectly not only that they were also suited for that character. 4. direction. no point on telling the director and his direction was excellent . 5. new world map . i guess its almost impossible to make your own world map which is done here. 6.reality mix with fiction : the series take some reality politics but added fiction like giants, witch , magic , wizard ,dragon etc which make series more and more watchable. 7.heart stopping ending at every season.cons: 1.sometime unnecessary nudity and sexuality which wasn't necessary . 2. too much talking in some episode which makes bore.verdict: this is the best series ever made ,worth watching ,yes but watch alone not with the family .(the review is made on the basis of tv series not on book)"
2018-08-29,grimmalkin,Dense interweaving storytelling,10,"dense interweaving storytelling with a lot of different motivations for different characters, which makes the overarching storylines a lot more unpredictable than one could imagine."
2019-05-22,aphilipp,Wow. So8 blew my mind LOVED ep 6,10,"big fan of books & tv series. i reckon almost all the characters got the life they would enjoy, even if they were not reconciled with what that ended up as. super duper tv series absolutely fantastic."
2014-04-18,suzanne-sellers,swimming in the sewer,7,"i have watched all the episodes of got as of april 18, 2014, so admittedly the new season has only just begun (the disgusting wedding of joffrey and margery just aired). the latest episode finally made me realize how utterly despicable this show is. not because of the violence, not because of the sex. i have seen wonderful shows that have too much violence and sex. what is missing from got is any semblance of humanity. i can count on one hand the number of decent characters still living (danerys and her general, arya stark, tyrion lannister, john snow, and the two small stark boys whose names escape me.) yes, there are a few more decent folks here and there, but they get very little air time and have no influence on the story. the rest are either corrupt, despicable or just plain evil. it is simply bad storytelling to only show evil and corruption, without a counter,balance of decency, love or normal human feeling. no one really loves anyone in got, or if they did, you can be sure somebody died horribly because of it. watching got feels like you swam in the sewer for an hour, and you're actually relieved when the hour is up. unfortunately, you can't get some of the hideous images out of your mind."
2019-04-29,azeezhaneef,Always the greatest series of all time,10,great fan of this masterpiece. always will be my favourite series.
2019-05-20,marcin778,The truth of GoT,9,from all main characters a virgin get's to be a king :)
2021-05-02,sagarpandya7762,Superb,7,perfect package except extreme levelled and disgusting presentation of human tendency and culture which tries to prove that human can be such disgusting animal. i hope it must be just imagination of some culture because if i talk my ancestor's culture than they were even better than modern human society we have now.... and even if it was so bad; some disgusting sex or belief scenes seemed forcefully added in series which felt like director is enjoying it personally....great thing is series itself. what a creation. mind blowing.
2018-05-31,dr-cheyno,"Once again, skip these idiot reviews and watch for yourself.",5,"as per usual, the imdb fan base has flooded the review section with biased trash. it's either 10/10 or 1/10. and a load of garbage in between. 
both lovers and haters have points. i feel it's a good story topped up with a bit of trash to fill in the time.
if you don't like gore, don't watch it.
if you don't like nudity, don't watch it.
if you don't like rape, incest and gay sex. don't watch it.it's a good watch if you don't mind these things. personally i have gotten sick of the whole notion of what i call ""shock value"" in tv series. killing off characters or having a rape scene purely because there's nothing else to do.
and the men, wow! this show is actually rather sexist towards men. women have all the power in this show, which given the age the show was set for really makes no sense at all. but i realise it's the in thing these days.
having a 12yo girl (let alone any 16,17yo) become a hero is just stupid imo. it's an adult show we don't need 12yo's running around acting hero. she is a good actor and does her job very well but just portrays a ridiculous character.decide for yourself, don't let the 99% of completely biased 10/10 - 1/10 reviews fool you.
both have their merits and it's worth deciding for yourself, don't let the die hard fans or haters decide for you."
2019-06-11,pkhall1,Had it 10/10....had to tearfully drop it to a 7/10....breaks my heart :(,1,"i thought nothing could ever top breaking bad. i was convinced that after ""the rains of castamere"", ""the mountain and the viper"", and ""hardhome,"" that got was able to give bb a true run for its money. then came the episode in season 6, ""the battle of the ba*t**ds"",--and i realized that breaking bad was dethroned. even after a weaker season 7, i had the feeling that got had it in the bag as best drama ever made. then came season 8, and i realized that got became different somehow. it very rapidly began losing its quality and its well earned place atop television's own ""iron throne."" breaking bad retook its place on that throne, and the gap widened with each episode of the 8th season. it literally crashed harder and faster than greg norman on the final day of the masters, or jim kelly or dan marino in a super bowl. i finally decided to lower my vote to 7/10. that is a c minus. that's the best i can honestly do. with the decimation of the series by the atrocious 8th season, that's really all it deserves. this is what is sometimes referred to as ""scr**wing the pooch."" imagine if rocky ended during the final boxing scene with rocky balboa just stopping during the fight and he began to literally scr** a pooch. it would seriously leave the viewer with an incredulous puzzled sickening moment and affect one viscerally and disturbingly. thanks d & d for scr**ing the proverbial pooch after 7 seasons of previously perfect work. you guys deserve to take home every razzie award to be given out for the next 10 years."
2017-03-10,bilalhussain-46904,Greatest thing to ever air on TV!,7,"you know how they always say it's one the best well, this is the best! game of thrones is without doubt the best written show of all time. in my opinion, no movie or tv series can stand toe to toe with got. the acting, the sets, the amount of work everyone puts in behind the scenes, the camera crews, the cinematography, the music score and actions scenes are right up there. from e01 to e60, s06. it has been an exhilarating journey. always unexpected things are happening. how according to some people bb is interesting and this is not, is beyond my comprehension. they can make separate tv series having 10 seasons with, tyrion and bronn, hound and arya, and jon snow and sam. every series has one or two favorite or least favorite character, it has dozens. oberyn, hound, lyanna, arya, ned and cersei, jofferey, ramsay, walder frey. uncountable greatest scenes, tyrion's speech, hardhome battle, battle of the bastards, oberyn and mountain dual and so much more. they way they make the simplest things dramatic is one of it's best qualities. upcoming 2 seasons will produce 10/10 episodes. it's completely and utterly unpredictable, if you have not read the books of course. i find it extremely annoying with the people who are always on how something is not real enough, to hose i say it's a fantasy. how dumb can a person be? despite that it is more real than most of the tv series present. this is as close to perfect as something can get. this is not overstating it. if you can't watch nudity maybe you should watch cartoons. can't wait for next seasons, when daenerys faces cersei, jon meets arya, dragons vs white walkers, littlefinger vs varys, this will be remembered as the best tv show to ever air, after it's finale."

i like the show 10/10"
2020-08-28,sudarshan-52058,I rated 1 to reduce average rating.(would rate it 8.5/10),5,"you have to admit that season 8 was not good at all. season 6,7 were also not good as previous seasons. this happened when d & d could not copy from the book."
2019-04-15,xrphantom,Good. But slightly over rated,1,"unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard of got.my 2 cents?it's good. very good. but also very over rated.watch. enjoy. experience. buy don't buy into the hype."
2019-03-22,pilawsopo,The Best TV Series in the World So Far,9,"got is a well,deserved perfect rating of 10/10. what else can i say, almost every critique here already said what needs to be said. i am just extremely glad that given the fact that the earth is approximately 4.2 billion years old, i managed to be born in the same era as game of thrones."
2017-08-11,evi-75011,Innovative!!,10,"no one is evil,even joffrey is a psycho insane as ramsey bolton,no one is good!! what an innovation!!you discover the heroes and their evolution throughout the series!! different from the books but less boring and completely unpredictable can keep the interest in higher levels than other series!the medieval scenery,the strong personalities,the battles,the soundtrack and the excellent performances make got the most popular tv series of the decade!but it is high time to be completed otherwise it will be tiring p.s season 7 was g r e a t!we got the satisfaction and the justice we were waiting from season 1when ned stark died in such an unfair way!arya and sansa's evolution are amazing and at last we understood that robert baratheon's rebellion was for nothing! the show deserves another golden globe and many awards for its deep personalities and great performances!martin knows a lot about psychology,for instance joffrey and ramsey have got reasons and difficult childhood that explain their insanity or cersei,who was an orphan and rejected by robert since the last one could not forget lyanna,has also reasons to be so cruel and narrow minded.martin's characters remind us dostoyevsky's karamazov brothers even the books are written in a simpler way of epic fantasy style i am wating season 8 to give the right end with a bitter sweet justice!!"
2019-05-23,evi-75011,A prequel is needed!,9,"i think the end is absolutely suitable for this piece of art!but maybe in a hurry so a prequel with the mad king's storyline maybe is needed,this way targaryen's insanity,as children of an incest,is going to be explained,however,i believe this ending is awesome!so many metaphors!dany is corrupted by the power although she has her good side she still remains a tyrant who should be eliminated!bran is handicap but wise!many people want heroes to be strong and handsome like aragorn in the lord if the rings but got isn't so predictable!yes guys a handicap can be more suitable as a king!and the instinct of a dragon explains why...drogon destroys the iron throne because the hunger for power corrupts everyone... if you expected a happy ending with a wedding between john and dany you wouldn't understand anything...got has no manichaeism,there aren't good and villain,this isn't marvel comics that's why we love it!!excellent characters and performances and maybe one day we will see not only a prequel but a sequel based in the upcoming books!!why not??i would love it!"
2020-01-19,danilovuletic-82696,Collapse of epic proportion,7,colapse of season 8 makes this whole series absolutely horrific and unrewatchable. knowing how disastrous it all ends makes me feel betrayed and fooled to involve myself into watching this and caring. the greatest disappointment in television history by far!!!!!!
2020-05-08,greennprple,A 9 but had to drop to an 8 due to last season,10,"the show was amazing for a while but then the seasons became a bit slow until the final season where it all fell apart. plenty of grandeur but no substance, and even the cinematography lacked. the ultimate fantasy drama with dragons and zombies and betrayal, murder and sex. it's still a must watch but prefer for disappointment"
2020-09-13,canurag-68747,Best in class..,8,the web series have everything except nice ending the the web series strong dialogue and serious characters give it edge and the story is just amazing...
2020-06-17,a_nikoloyiannis,A great love and a great disappointment,10,"for years i was a big denier of game of thrones. i watched it for the first time during quarantine, after years of brainwashing from those around me. i can say that i fell in love with it, especially until the 5th cycle. and not to hide, while i had no idea what impact it had for so many years, i fell in love with the character of daenerys or khaleesi if you prefer. it happened so normally that when i decided to see it again in the last few days, i felt exactly the same. and to end up with such a scenario disappointment. a real mess! in conclusion, the series until the 5th season is definitely for a 10/10, in terms of criticism. but beyond that, without the support of books, quality is constantly declining. probably, after 50 episodes of the first cycles, at least thirty more were needed to complete its story correctly, or maybe more. this never happened and it seems that it has damaged the series in the end and possibly its backwardness. because, even if we accept that the final ending of the characters is the one that george r. r. martin will show in the last books that have not been released, the way to reach this end was completely wrong and outrageous. for the 6th season i would score a total of 8/10, for the 7th hardly a 6/10 or at most 7/10. finally, the tragic 8th season with what happened does not pass the base, so i would indulgently put a 4/10, but i think is lower. the downfall of the story of knight king and especially daenerys, condemns the 8th season to a low and unacceptable score for such a tv project.i believe that the series should have stopped in the 5th cycle and should not have moved beyond the books. the series eventually fell victim to its own success. mainly for the first five cycles i will give a general score of 8/10."
2018-07-22,peytonfredonson,All was well until the end of Season 1,10,"i have spent the last 3,4 weeks, watching got when i can. i work full time, so as you can imagine, i don't get much time to myself. i spent years, i mean years, hearing about this series. i was always skeptical, but i thought i would give it a go. i was enjoying the story line, until i reached a certain point of no return. things took a turn, maybe to excite the audience and make them want to watch more? i have no idea. acting got bad, plot got messy and frustrating to watch. it was sad to watch ned and cat stark disconnect from their children. also, when ned was locked up, where the hell was cat? some people might say that i don't have a life, if i'm looking for a new tv show to watch. i do have all time favourites, which are that, my favs that i literally never get tired of. so i'm not just a person who doesn't like anything. but i was willing to give this a try. i didn't even reach to the end of season 1. long story short, i believe that life is that, short. no body has time to waste on bad tv. this show is so overrated."
2015-08-31,anne07876,Great BUT!,4,"great acting, great photography, setting and story! the creativity and imagination is a joy to watch. i give this 2 stars due to the raunchy nature of the script, and its strong misogynistic elements that are in just about every episode. it seems to render this story much more a film of our age, rather than a timeless classic that it could be. incidentally, if this is a mirror of our times, then we are headed for some dark days indeed. some say frankenstein was pushing the boundaries back in the day, and the violent 70's screamer horror films was another genre that pushed the boundaries. screamer horror films evolved, and those old screamers are a rare sight these days. the same will happen to this series. we will move on, and evolve. i'm glad i didn't invest my money in the production.it makes me also quite sad to think the level of lack of respect shown in this series is required to gain public attention, which i don't believe is true. i think it cheapens the series, and is definitely unnecessary. my toes cringe every time a scene that is clearly sadistic and unnecessary comes on.a great story, told well and photographed beautifully, is all that is needed. this series has lost 2 viewers from my household after watching just series 2 for these reasons. we doubt much will improve, and fear it will only get worse. after reading some reviews, it seems to be the case. we'll be moving onto far more worthy programs such as true detective and penny dreadful , great story telling, great acting, photography and scenes that remain in line with the story itself. the hobbit film trilogy will remain my firm favourite in terms of fantasy epics - a film that holds its integrity without relying on naked bodies and sadistic shock tactics to sell it."
2020-06-10,calebstephens-90947,Shoulda Coulda been the greatest show of all time but NOPE,10,"i was waiting to see if got would have a decent ending so i can say if got is the greatest show of all time or breaking bad, nope it doesn't. if it had at least a decent ending got would be the greatest show of all time but nope it has a garbage ending. shoulda coulda been the greatest show of all time but nope now it officially goes to breaking bad. smh"

2014-04-08,rich920215,Booooooooorrring!,9,"i have given up on this piece of garbage, it is so boring, being nothing but an unending parade of characters, all with mops of hair all over the place, fur, leather, steel, breastplates, swords, spears, blood and ambition. every show is nothing but turgid scene after turgid scene, strung together in no discernibly meaningful sequence, of these buffoons endlessly engaging in inane verbal sparring matches, torture and murder, or sex. even the sex scenes stink, nothing but flat chested babes obligatorily baring their embarrassing aaa cup breasts. it doesn't even qualify as porn. the plot, if there is one, moves at a glacial pace, strewn with confusion at all turns. the editing cuts from one verbal sparring match to the next, with nary a thought to continuity of place, character or plot. it is boring, repetitive and leads nowhere. there are simply too many characters, locations, schemes, supernatural events and words to form a coherent presentation. if you took all the episodes of the whole season, cut them at every scene and then scrambled them all together you could then splice them back together at random and you'd have a new season of episodes with no detectable difference. my wife is addicted to this crud so i have to endure it as she endures my netflix choices of history and documentaries. i read while she rots her brain with this horrible waste of electricity, running the tv and dvd player."

2012-05-08,connelly-shawn,Sets the bar impossibly high for a TV series!,8,"i just watched the first two episodes of spartacus and i am unsure if i want to bother watching any more of that series. in stark (no pun intended) contrast, i was absolutely captivated by game of thrones by the first episode of the first season. i am pretty critical and up to the latest episode, i cannot say anything negative about game of thrones. it sets the bar impossibly high for all tv series. game of thrones represents the epitome of classiness, quality, character development, and it has successfully included sex and violence in a manner that is necessary for the story line.kudos to all those involved! it is everything that spartacus is not!"
2014-04-15,geekroad,UnimaginativeTestosterone Pretending To Be Edgy,1,"i confess i did not read the books, and did not even give game of thrones a try until just today when i watched the pilot. the name simply didn't appeal, but after catching positive buzz about it, i wondered if it could possibly be something like my beloved spartacus series which sadly ended last season.i could not have been more wrong. the one thing they do have in common is production value. that's sadly where it ends.where spartacus had deliciously gripping plots weaving phenomenally,written characters together into intimate dramas, got throws out an endless cast of colorless, simplistic characters hoping something will stick. worse, the plot is as old and moldy as the characters, (kings wanting their mtv, yadda yadda yadda). and while spartacus had more than its share of over-the-top violence and depravity, it all served a purpose and the writers still managed to expose the humanity of each character through it all. in got the sex, depravity and greed is gratuitous, shallow and as pointless as the rest of the show, leaving me with a sense that i just watched the unimaginative fantasy of a 9yr old boy with anger issues.the first five minutes had me thinking maybe this was going to be a good show... but it quickly derailed into boredom and by the halfway point in the pilot i was wondering if i should waste my time watching the second half. i did, but it only confirmed my opinion.spartacus always left me feeling exhilarated because of the outstanding writing and characters. in fact the characters and plots were so well written the show could stand on its own with most of the sex and violence edited out, as could happen if it is ever syndicated for network tv. game of thrones, on the other hand, feels like a flat, old, board game. no standout character. no standout plot line. nothing to pull me in and make me want to see more."
2011-05-25,ipselute,Simply the best!,4,"i'm no fan of history shows, whatever type it be. yet i do enjoy this show. and that's no little thing, especially when it be coming from a startrek/stargate addict. it's purely fictional, yet it ressembles middle age england. i admire screenplayers and actors for using a pretty strong language sometimes, yet i have no criticism on that, i believe it makes the show more real. truly brits. i wish i had a detailed map of the realm and a genetic map of all the characters. there are so many distinct characters, sometimes is hard to keep track on who's related to whom. i don't know why imdb.com is forcing me to write at least 10 lines of text on this subject! if i'd write 10 pages on it, it still wouldn't be enough. you just have to watch it for yourselves!"
2013-05-15,mandy-715-527949,Best Series Ever!,3,"i cannot remember a time when i've given something 10/10 but game of thrones deserves it. set in the backdrop of a fantasy land, where there are power struggles for supremacy galore! the characters are well developed and you feel you slowly get to know everyone. the beauty of this is the characters grow and you get to find out more and more about them, they become deep and intricate.you have to stay on the ball as there are many story lines and there is much to follow, but it's worth it. it is gripping, really gripping. the author isn't afraid to shock you, to take characters out and there's always something unexpected. story lines continue over each episode, and it takes a while to work out what is going on in some cases, which all adds to its mystique.i love this series, i cannot recommend it enough! be aware there's lots of bad language, sexual scenes etc, but strangely you don't mind as it adds to realism of the story and its setting. truly amazing work and the actors are epic in their roles, every one of them believable.go and watch! :,)"
2011-04-20,ivan-caldarevic,"Blood, Sex and Fantasy!",10,"first thing, i am a huge fan of george r.r. martin books, specially the songs of ice and fire novels.i was so happy when i heard that this novels will be filmed and released as a show. enormous plus was the fact that it will be filmed in hbo production, which is in my opinion, the absolute leader in the field of filming shows and series.last week i saw first 14 minutes of the show on official hbo website, and.... shivers went up and down my spine of shear excitement!finally the day to see the first episode was here. and here were the expectations, so much of them. and that probably is the thing that almost ruined everything for me... first 14 minutes that i saw earlier were so tense, realistic and even scary! everything was as i imagined while reading the book! characters were on a highest level, setting was awesome, the winter was coming! i was thrilled! and expectations increased accordingly... after that moment something happened and my overall experience with the episode went down the hill. i found some of the acting a bit weird, music didn't fit all of the time and sometimes annoyed me. interiors were too artificial and, again, didn't fit my expectations. everything happened too fast, which is logical since the information in the book are massive and it would be hard to fit them all into the series, but i could notice that, and that is more than enough to give me the reason to think is it possible that one of largest and most beautiful fantasy books ever are too complicated and complex to film a series about them.after the first episode i can only say: peter dinkleage and sean bean are awesome as usual! the episode followed the book in best possible manner (even though too fast), characters and locations are just as you could imagine them while reading the book. the plot is is intriguing and will pin down to the chair everyone that haven't read the book. of course, there is plenty of sex, violence and blood for everyone that expect that from hbo.even though i think that there are flaws, the game of thrones episode 1 deserves enough of viewers attention to watch it once again before the second episode, just to give it a shot and i think it will repay you for that in later episodes.all in all even though my first experience isn't the best one, i think this one is a winner which will be a must for every fan of the book, and one of best series in some time in eyes of most of the viewers that didn't read the book. another hbo's success! enjoy the winter!"

2012-12-28,pk1873,Hmmmmm,8,"as i await season 3, this show has been posted as the 'top user rated tv series of 2012' while i thoroughly enjoy most episodes i have found one thing in particular lacking... meaningful battle scenes.. we have seen armies sweep across the fabled land of westeros while rarely seeing them draw a sword in anger, this show is in effect a 'medieval' soap opera with occasional glimpses of the real action, my main issue with this is that the program demands more action and on a much grander scale and in reality it pretends to have these set pieces in abundance which is a little bit of hype on the part of the producers. anyone who wants to see epic battle sequences will be bitterly disappointed. i can only hope that in this coming season we will actually see more of these 'wars' played out on the battlefield rather than focusing completely on the aftermath of battles or the reactions of various noblemen."

2020-12-06,kdiamond666,"I gave it a 6, but Honestly I will Never Watch again or Recommend",9,"the 1st 4,5 seasons of this show are a solid 10. i can't find a flaw in them at all. everyone knows the story from here on out, so i'll keep it simple. the beginning content is retroactively ruined by the worst ending ever. it's not just the last season either. it begins around season 6. however every episode in the final season is progressively worse than the last, up to the last episode which is nothing less than nauseating. you will feel cheated. endings matter. and i love downer endings. this is just awful hot garbage writing. so....do not watch this series at all"
2015-01-24,swanmj,This show is boring to watch,9,"i watched one and one,half episodes of this, and i got bored with it. all that it was was gossip, sex, and conspiring to back-stab each other. there are no heroic quests or epic battles. none. it all hinges, instead, on gossiping about who-had-sex-with-who and who-back-stabbed-who for the throne. there is no real substance to it. i did not really feel any connection to the characters. i did not feel like i was in a fantasy at all. i felt more like i was in a world of boring gossip. if this were to be any other genre, it would be much less popular. people probably only like this because it has a medieval setting. however, when you take away all of the castles, armor, wild boars, and swords, you are just stuck with a bunch of gossips."
2019-11-24,callvikastimes,Best in fantasy but too cliche,1,first of all i would like to thank producers and makers of got who visioned this. now come to the point...this series was too cliche we have seen many war sequences like this but without dragon. writing was good till season 5.
2021-06-15,cathj-53991,Season 6 should be the last one,10,"in my opinion, something happened after the end of season 6. but no one is telling exactly what. many people say that this is david d and david w fault, but i don't believe they ruined the show on purpose. some people say that actors were very tired, or was not enough money to continue... only god knows what really happened then."
2019-05-20,godsdesign,This is only related to Season 8...which has been trash,3,"overall: the show is still a solid 8.5,9 out of 10 in my book. season 8: 5 out of 10the actors really did their best. the visuals were done really well. but the showrunners ignored everything set up over 7 seasons. then they tried to justify their failings in the aftershow commentary.i'd be fine with the way the season turned out if there hadn't been so much foreshadowing done over the last decade. there were things that were beaten over the head to foreshadow. all for dan and dave to say, ""nope. we're just gonna rush everything up so we can move on to something else."" it was all a huge letdown and truly a disservice to the fans. i enjoyed the first couple of seasons and really got hooked in season 3. it's disappointing to have seen everything so hurried that basic character arcs were abandoned or seemingly forgotten.the show is over. but, next time, hbo, when the showrunners of the most popular tv show of all times wants to wrap things up in a rushed fashion: please hire new people.if you've never seen the show before, or aren't too deep into it yet, ignore all foreshadowing. treat each season as it's own story. at the end of the day, it's still a great show. just a massively disappointing conclusion."

That was enough!,4,"it's so sad that we've now evolved into a race of easily satisfied, pseudo reality tv watching, brain fried morons, but it's fortunate for the makers of this type of dross that we have, otherwise an intelligent, critically thinking audience would never have given this nonsense the time of day. it is clearly a rip off of many ideas from tolkien to i claudius, from homer to peckinpah and finally ray harryhaussen!! take elements from each, add graphic violence, sex and nudity and you've got a hit for any teenage boy. unfortunately a large section of the viewing public now also have the limited intelligence of a teenage boy. so sad."
2019-07-20,undsiebzig,From good to bad,10,"as a fan of the stories george rr nartin wrote, i was syked to hear they'd be making a series adaptation.i first thought to myself, wow... the writers (d&d) are really good at this. all of the fight scenes were brutally epic and the story corresponded to the books. after season 6, when they clearly drifted apart from the books, because the next book wasn't finished yet, the quality began to slip. the first three episodes of season 7 could have been all under one episode. then i started thinking to myself, well technically, george rr martin wrote the books, d&d were just adapting it for tv. after season 8 it became quite clear d&d had no idea what they were doing. either:
they (d&d) rode high on their success and forgot how to write a proper storyor:
they had no clue since day 1 and weren't paying attention to the previous episodesseason 8 started off a little dull, yet still alright, in the first two episodes they were preparing for the big battle at winterfell
the 3rd episode was epic, with all the action and so on, but when you think about it, which characters that were essential to the story perished? maybe sir jorah or theon, but other than that?
one thing that upset me was the lighting, you couldn't see a thing in the darkness of the night.
from there on the plot was really rushed, which was too bad an ending for such an epic show."

2017-09-20,abs-75657,A masterpiece,10,"this series could easily be considered a masterpiece as far as tv shows are concerned. there was a fair share of lackluster performing from certain members of the cast insofar as the delivery of certain lines was concerned, but all in all it's great. other than changing how certain lines were delivered/the inflection of voice with which certain lines were delivered, there isn't much else to gripe about. this series is worth the hours of your life you lose watching it."

2020-07-02,dyssonant,Utter failure,4,"a very good show along its first half (seasons 1,2-3-4). then the downfall starts and it goes downhill. the writing becomes growingly nonsensical from season 5 on. brilliant conversations and character devolpment cease to exist and we only witness plot advances which come completely out of the blue with no rational construction. arya's plot becomes absurd, so as well dorne's plot, the whole plot of going beyond the wall to capture a wight is beyond ridiculous, the love story between jon and dany falls flat and lacks any chemistry, the long night against the others is cortoonish, the character of bran is just sort of an oracle who becomes eventually king for no reason at all, the transformation of dany into the evil villain/bad tyrant is also cartoon-like, the interaction arya/sansa is childish and utterly irritating. a terrible level of writing, everything was rushed and nonsensical despite the millions dollar producton value, a very poor and embarassing intellectual complexity. complete disaster from season 5 on.and listen to me: dont't trust those who say that it was all good til last season, which ruined everything. last season was indeed terrible, but the seventh was maybe even more terrible, and also 5th and 6th were no better. actually, only a miracle could salvage the show at last season, but should have been clear at that point that the show runners were not adequate to write a show of high quality by their own (dialogs and plots).the downfall of game of thrones will remain as a supreme example of a miserable failure of a television show after one of the most stirring start ever.no interest at all in any rewatch of this series."

2019-11-01,rhirahan,The first seven seasons were absolutely incredible!,9,"obviously we were all expecting to be taken into another dimension watching the last season, which unfortunately didn't happen but exact opposite. cinematography however was amazing. anyway, the disappointing last season doesn't change the fact, that the first seven seasons were the absolute top tier of all series ever filmed in our history. if you're planning on watching the series, go for it, but know that while it is great, it is also as vulgar and cruel as it can be."

2011-04-19,mark-d-jordan1,"OK, But Not Excellent",9,"i give this show some accolades so far for sticking to the books pretty well. the acting was actually very good as well as the costumes. i can't say i was a huge fan of the settings. something was missing that i could not put my finger on. maybe too much cgi? i'd prefer real sets in this story i think, where possible. i'm getting a little tired of the same type modern computer graphics look in all these different series on the various networks. the other problem was the speed they attempted to introduce the characters. seems like i couldn't quite get an endearment for any of them yet. i guess they were just trying to get people hooked from the beginning and introduce the whole map area and various families. i'm not sure that worked well in practice. i'll watch the whole thing with the hope that it works out well, but i am not real overly impressed with the beginning. not bad, just not excellent."

""red woman"" was one of the most truly evil characters in the show yet she has done so much to let the ""good prevail"" in the end. that was my favorite moment which i would like to see several times again.* spoilers end*so my friends, don't listen to haters, there is a trend going on to ""bash"" whatever that is popular among common people. don't be fooled, watch several episodes and decide it for yourself.game of thrones will remain in my memory as one of the greatest shows i have seen."
2011-04-17,psypeterson,Excellent adaptation.,4,"readers who come to this review later in the series must note that, at the time of this writing, i have only seen the inaugural episode. it's probably safe to say, when dealing with a series of novels as beloved as the song of ice and fire, the most scrutinized aspect of the t.v. adaptation will be how well it holds to the source material. i am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.while certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). the characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably peter dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. however; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.special effects were well done, though nothing mind,blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). it also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.all and all, i am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and i went into it expecting to be disappointed. if i were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.updateafter watching the entire first season, i can safely say this is perhaps the best adaptation of book into film/tv. while many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.in addition, new scenes (by which i mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (eg: asides which explain character/world history).top form, hbo. top form."
2011-09-24,kaleko,Nudity and Gore,10,"i really wanted to watch this. i really did. and i really wanted to like this.there is just so much nudity that i am not continuing.this show seems to have lots of neat and interesting points to it. but i have seen enough of women's naked body parts. and i simply cannot stomach any more.many people obviously don't mind this. but i absolutely hate that what looks like such an interesting show has been cheapened so badly. some people may call it ""gritty"" and ""realistic."" i find it trashy. you can still imply things are happening without shoving it in your face.i am extremely irked because i simply love fantasy, and the mythical creatures, political situations, and intricate world makes me want to watch this badly.but i don't know if i can get through my disgust. i almost turned it off after seeing yet another de,robing of a woman (the second time with this particular woman) with her pointed parts in plain view, while a man proceeded to take advantage of her while she was crying. i mean, this show can stand on its own without all this stuff and still be successful. what is the point of throwing in this trash? is titillation to draw in perverted viewer counts worth ruining what could otherwise be a very respectable timeless work? i believe that whoever decided to include this was directly, and absolutely, lowering the value of this work.anyway, i'm sure many will disagree with me, but i was extremely disappointed.additionally, yes there was a fair amount of gore. a lovely intestine hanging out of a freshly sliced man, maggots on a de-gutted deer with a closeup of its head and bloated tongue, be-headings with pretty views of the red neck meat. ugh. it was not as bothersome as my prior complaint, but i don't have too much of a problem with gore. also it wasn't as frequent.with so many positive ratings, i feel that my viewpoint should be put out there."
2011-07-20,alnu-930-982284,Perfect,8,"intrigue, action, perfect portrays of characters, vivid acting. it required all my attention since the dialogs were linked throughout the whole story and playback would have made me ruin the awesome epic flow of narration. 10 lines of review would be quite demanding in terms of praising possibilities to depict the hunger i had for watching the next episode during the whole of this 1st series. watch this as it is not only meant to be a lesson in taste for viewers but also a masterpiece that probably won't be equaled for many years, a grindstone for film directors and aspiring movie stars. do not watch it all at once as it requires your eyes and ears to be wide open. i bow to the art."
2019-05-21,rickfletcher28,It was 10/10 till season 8,10,"this series really blows your mind. starts out hitting hard and always surprises you. you fall in love with some characters, and loathe others. the depth of the story is very well thought out and it seems like there is a large purpose for what you are watching. season 7 was short but amazing. it told a story of something that we all dreaded was coming, an ending. but low and behold, season 8 rushes in and destroys all hope for a well written finale to a story that has dedicated to staying true to the plot. so if you just now start watching this show, prepare yourself for a disappointing end. and even after people saying that we never should have expected a happy ending, that wasn't what we hoped for. i believe we hoped for an ending that would coincide with the rest of the story. not something rushed and out of the blue."

2015-06-01,shesetsail,Enough,10,"i have watched got from the start, and sometimes i have been absolutely captivated. had a wobble at craster's keep, but decided to give the show another chance.there's always been that sense of sexploitation in got. apologists say that this is just how the world of westeros is; a very violent, very misogynistic place. people in general are treated badly. but here's the thing, in got world, men may be slaughtered horribly, children may be threatened and slaughtered horribly. but only one gender gets threatened, raped, humiliated and slaughtered on a regular basis. and that's a bit peculiar when you think about it.male rape happens in the most horrible of horrible worlds, as does child rape. but it never appears in westeros because, quite rightly, most viewers would thoroughly object. so if it's not ok to depict male rape or child rape in a fantasy world, why is it ok to depict female rape in the same situation? because the audience is used to it? because the audience accepts it? because certain parts of the audience may even like it? sexual abuse as screen filler seems particularly cynical when it has no background in the source material, but covers a very real issue in later got; with the charismatic and clever villains gone, the story is slowing a lot. no amount of sexual violence is going totake the place of pace.bring on the dragons and the white walkers because if we can't have good writing, we might as well have great effects , and if we can't afford to get the audience used to high fantasy blow-outs, what's the answer? more women screaming and sobbing? don't bother on my account. whatever i'm watching, it won't be more of this."
2013-08-25,jjb-sonis,"The Story of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is not Being Told",10,"*** includes spoilers , do not read this if you love the books and have not started watching the show yet! ***first, if you have not started with reading the books, then i suggest waiting until the show is finished. then again, maybe i will be too nit picky with my review, and you can simply enjoy watching and reading...summary: a great production and a great show when based only on its own merits, but is a disgrace to the story of ""a song of ice and fire"" and does a great disservice to the fans of the books it is to be based upon. the shows do not come close to being true to or measuring up to the quality of character development, world building and the just plain excellent storytelling enjoyed when reading the books. season three did an especially bad job sticking to the story told in the first half of ""a storm of swords"" as it just goes off, messes a lot up, and tells it in a way that i suppose would be required when only ~10 hours of time is made available.details: since each season and every episode of this show have martin's blessing, i am assuming that he is okay with ""game of thrones"" being loosely based -- in an extreme manner -- on his epic masterpiece of fantasy literature.i could tolerate the first two seasons as they were not too incredibly far off from the the first two books (still, very far off). but the third season takes things way too far regarding the show's deviation from the books.i watched the premier of the third season until i saw how badly the storyline of every primary protagonist of the books was going to be abused by the very excessive of creative license taken by the writers (and maybe martin himself as well) of the show. what really struck me was that for some reason selmy was on his own when he came to save daenerys and that a simple yet important character such as strong belwas was absent. i decided at that point to stop watching. and the season ended and i was determined not to care, not even when the ""red wedding"" became national news during a slow news cycle.however, as time crept on i came to terms with the fact that the show and the books are not the same and that the overall quality of the show cannot be compared to the far superior and actual story of the books. ""game of thrones"" is not ""a song of ice and fire"" and i now view the show as telling one story and the books telling another.after thinking on it, and being somewhat persuaded to do so by others, i decided to just watch the third season since i had mostly enjoyed the first two. the quality of production and (for the most part) dialog and acting are superior to just about anything else tv - i rank the show on its own merits being on the same level as the sopranos and boardwalk empire as far hbo shows and most any other shows on tv go. but, still, despite the fact that i have come to understand the show as being a very condensed and exceptionally loose adaptation of the books it is to be based on, and despite the fact that i do enjoy watching the show, i can only say i really half like it because of how much i loved reading and re-reading the books and how often i have to ask ""where is that character?"", ""why did they leave that key event out?"", or ""why would they change that when it would be just as easy to stay true to what was in the book?"". add to that the alternate story for asha that starts up in the season finale of season three really irks me. not to mention the bones i have to pick regarding bran's story...if only hbo could dedicate more than 10 episodes at ~50-55 minutes each for a season, maybe the story of ""game of thrones"" would be much more in line with the actual story of ""a song of ice and fire"" and would be a much better show because of it. however, that is not the case. it will be interesting to see what they do with the second half of ""a storm of swords"" and exactly how great the show itself can be while still messing with my book-reading mind.yes, i enjoy the show, but my love of the books necessitates dropping my vote to a 5/10 and it's getting a 5 and not less because this is in part a show that is being overseen by martin himself and i have come to appreciate how he has agreed with and influenced in whatever way he can the story being told in ""game of thrones"" and how it is being told.now, can we book fans please get ""the winds of winter"" sooner rather than way too much later???"
2020-08-04,alexathan94,"Never understood the fuss, plot holes in the last seasons",10,"amazing costumes, breathing settings, expensive production, amazing cast yes, but let's be honest the plot was slow and repetitive. it was clearly game of thrones, every now and then someone was killed in few episodes. and let's not get started about the final season, it was a total mess, a patchwork of scenes and characters actions that never made scenes and led to the destruction of the cohesion of the show. the big bad night king killed single handed after somehow she reached to him, although surrounded by his whole armyi never liked the woman with the hundred names, way too annoying about her birthright to the throne, she was an awful leader and person, with great opinion about herself. the ending was expected that she would go nuts, become the mad queen and thankfully find her maker. the most suitable ruler for this crazy land was cersie, she would have killed them all and lived happily ever after.the only season that was truly great for me was season six. the events that took place were breathtaking and fast paced. loved the music of the light of the seven and the whole scene.all the other seasons were way too slow, and especially the trial of tyron that kept forever."
2020-05-12,manas-kido,Lost the game of thrones,10,"could have been all time best show, terrible writing in the end ruined the show. season 1,4 was best, then became cringy and dull. and season 8 was like typical bollywood action movies. this is the only show where they developed 8-10 major characters. overall show is mind blowing."
2020-10-12,lovejoycaleb,Show deserves a 0 after the worst TV show ending of all time.,10,no need to say more. it's a sad excuse for a tv show when the ending is so bad it shouldn't even have been made.
2019-05-22,samadeeb,Why!!,7,when you let kids continue what giants started .. that's what happens.. you've destroyed 8 years of passion .. the reason is why!!!
2014-07-26,kunovega,Not as good as it should have been...,10,"let me start off by saying this is hands down one of the best tv shows on the air today. unfortunately part of me can't help but wonder if it's the lack of other quality tv options most of the time that lead me to feel that way.there is a lot to love here: quality acting, nicely done sets, great attention to detail in props and scenery. judged on it's own merits there is a lot to enjoy and take in. as a spectacle of it's own this is among the best tv has to offer, with only a handful of movies (with larger budgets) that can top it for its genre.the problem is; this has source material. being based on a book series that is simply far and away the best of it's kind printed in the last decade. having read the books this is where the problems with the show begin to bleed through: the plot simply is not as good as it pretends to be.you have a,list material from the books which could have been lifted page for page; but instead the show writers have chosen to not only truncate the dialogue but also write in their own mediocre scenes.don't get me wrong, i fully understand cutting some things simply because the books are so much longer. but what i can't agree with is cutting material and than replacing it: that means you did have time for things you skipped...the stuff being added is b-grade at best.that's the shows biggest sin; dumping good scenes and adding in fluff. the laundry list of other changes (characters that were cut; merged and otherwise changed) is also a bit unsettling. the entire ""game of thrones"" has essentially been dumbed down for tv. what should be a chess game of monarchs is watered down to a couple of idiots playing checkers. some of the blood lines for example instead of having multiple heirs only have 1 and the threats and plots surrounding them have been simplified or nearly cut entirely. and in its place? extra sex scenes from minor characters.the show is at it's best when it stays true to the books, the dialogue and plot twists shine and keep you engaged. than it wanders off into la-la land where the writers think they know better than the source material and all i can do is shake my head and wonder just how truly epic and amazing this could have been.so; is the show good? yea. just not as good as it should have been. they were handed the keys to one of the most well developed fantasy worlds ever written, and i just wish they would stop hiding under the bed sheets and stick to the source material.in summary all i can tell you is this: read the books. unless you lack imagination and reading comprehension it will be one of the best reads of your life.watch the show afterwards and take it for what it's worth: a 9 that should have been a 10."
2019-05-26,brickscube,Was a 10/10 show at first,9,"i enjoyed season 8 episodes 1,5. yes even 5, i saw it as fanfiction and was able to enjoy it as a ""what if?"" scenario. basically tricking my brain. i went to watch episode 6 but it doesn't even work as fanfiction or amateur writing.this is going to sound unbelievable but the finale seemed like it was a parody episode. it had the same beat, the same scenic timing, and implausibility of a parody movie but then someone tried to take all the humour out and just keep the plot or story structure if that makes sense? and also add in amazing special effects and acting to wow the audience.but it becomes this bizarre show where all this epic music/vfx/acting comes in but your brain is just confused because the story doesn't match the quality of these other aspects."
2017-06-30,baliakashbali,The best show on planet earth along with Davinci's Demons!!,4,game of thrones was the second ever watched series for me... and just because the first show that i watched was davinci's demons... i rate it better and as the best show ever!! but that doesn't mean that i need to take anything away from got!! wonderfully written and wonderfully acted... this is what signifies got!! got features complete different worlds and stories taking place at the same time... and my god what a long way it has come... because the way it was at the beginning... and the way it is now... a big round of applause for george rr martin and the cast and crew of the show........there might be very few people who ain't aware of how amazing this show is... but there still are such kinda people... so do yourselves a favour and watch the best show on planet earth along with davinci's demons!!
2019-05-01,fivelocks,Good action. Zero storytelling in the end.,1,game of thrones went from best series of all time to a video game of action with a bad script. the depth of it all disappeared between idiotic romances and beautiful war scenes. the biggest disappointment.
2019-09-16,thenerdygamer,Built Up To Be Torn Down,10,"it's september the 16th, it has been almost 4 months since the final episode aired and i still haven't gotten over the fact this show ended so poorly. i had no hope left that this final episode of the entire show would surprise me and actually be good unlike the previous episodes in season 8. i still can't belive how this show ended. i can't belive that i will never witness a proper finale to what used to be the best tv show. i am heartbroken, shook and completely and utterly dissapointed. the writing used to be best thing about game of thrones and in season 8, it was thrown out of the window to rush the ending. so much was built up just to be torn down. only thing keeping this show from being a 1/10 is the amazing visuals, acting, action and all the incredible previous seasons before season 8. goodbye game of thrones, i don't think i will ever watch this show again."
2019-05-03,subhodeb,A must watch for every Fantasy as well as realistic drama lovers.,10,"this show is awesome. i started watching it last year and as of nowi didn't found any reason to be its critic but yes on some points it could've been more accurate as an example the night king throws a sphere to the dragon which worked, but the same way when bronn thrown, that didn't work. so just this kind of short things.. otherwise i loved all the episodes and also the recent episode 3 of season 8 , the long night is tremendous!"
2019-05-17,thekissinggirls,Love it!,1,i must be rare in that i found the first few series of got boring and have fallen in love with the show from series 5 onwards! i love this final series so much. i particularly love that danny has finally shown her true colours and can't understand why anyone would be surprised by her actions. i for one am in no way disappointed or shocked. love love love it!
2019-05-12,joannae-32397,Best Show on TV,8,"this is the best show on tv, hands down. it can go a little overboard on cgi and feels a little rushed compared to the books toward the last season but you it still keeps you on your toes and guessing."

2019-06-23,maarten_c,Disapointing,10,great show. bad ending... they rushed everything in a few episodes wich aren't all to bad but hardly resolve any story lines and basicly are nothing more than a 'thank you for watching but let's wrap this up. fast.'
2018-05-01,joshkej-84077,Pleasantly surprised,9,"for so long i'd been hearing so much about this show but never felt the urge to watch it since i've never been a fan of a medieval setting and i'd started to grow tired of over the top gore and sex, but still i wanted to find out what i was missing since so many people seemed to like it.all i can say is that i'm pleasantly surprised. i've just finished season 7 and while i was watching i couldn't stop. it quite literally sucks you in. yes there is a lot of gore and sex but there are many genuinely heartwarming moments too. it does drag on a bit at certain points and there are several subplots that pretend to be important to the story that i actually ended up skipping, but for the most part the story is brilliant and complex and filled with both genuinely good and wonderfully despicable characters. the cinematography is also georgeous and the world is stunning and diverse. i'm looking forward to the final season.overall i'd say that it is really worth a watch. don't be put off by the fact that it's got blood and boobs and just watch it! you won't regret it!"
2019-05-22,ocnu-87277,Anticlimactic end,10,"the show was a 10 all the way up until the 8th season and then hbo doesn't want to do anaraya stark spin,off they should think about sending her west in pursuit of the dragon and the targaryens body and making an epic adventure we're tired of prequels even though it does have some interesting qualities to it show us what becomes of the world after a new king is appointed if hbo isn't going to do it let somebody else"
2020-12-19,barnabeast,Used to be so good,10,"used to be a great show for the first 4 seasons, some parts were even done better in the show than the books, then season 5 was no where near as good but not awful, 6 was a bit better, had ups and downs, 7 was poor in quality but not outrageous, and 8...wow, it's honestly quite funny how bad it is, i just can't get my head around it, the only good parts after season 4 were: sansa getting raped (weird thing to describe as good but it shows what more she has to go through and how strong her character is)
stannis' speech to shireen
the last two episodes of season 6
hold the door!"
2019-05-21,kellingjonas,It was a ride,10,"i loved the first 5 seasons than it went down for a bit in seasons 6 and 7 but season 8 was ok enough (not i context of the entire series (in that context it is bad)) but over all there will probably be nothing like this for the next 20,30 years (in my opinioni have lots of criticism for the show but this is a general opinion and not a review :) ps: my favorite charakters were sansa,jamie and littlefinger
least favorite were aria, joffrey, ramsey, daenerys( i liked her in season 1 for a wile and in season 2)[...]"

2019-05-07,richruzicka,Last 2 seasons sucked,10,1 threw 4 seasons were great 5 and 6 were good 7 and 8 so bad can't believe hbo could call it game of thrones. maybe with different writers the whole series would have bine great.

2020-04-15,ianmcclure-51882,Shame it could of been a 10 if not for that lackluster of a final season,3,"i will say that this still a great tv show and one you should still watch but, man that last season was really bad."
2021-01-03,steveantonchuk,Ended so badly it's now a forgotten joke,10,"started great, last 2 seasons were so bad that i can imagine ever watching it again.compare that to bsg, breaking bad, or even lost and it's obvious that this is not worth wasting your time on."
2020-03-13,caenleranzo,Hollywoodized to Death,10,"this show has been hollywoodized to death because the characters in this show are more physically attractive compared to the characters in the books. daenerys targaryen is still annoying with her self,entitlement complex to me. littlefinger gets killed in a boring and disgraceful way in game of thrones. characters such as tyrion lannister and cersei lannister have lower i.q.s and less suspenseful intentions after george r.r. martin stopped being involved in this show after season 5. jon snow never says much and there's never any narration about what he's thinking, so i don't find myself interested in him. ygritte is better than daeneys targaryen from my perspective, so i was feeling uncomfortable the entire time that daenerys and jon were intimate with each other. ramsay bolton in the books was more dangerous in the books than in this show because, like i said, this show has been hollywoodized to death to benefit the sensitive audience at the expense of quality violence, quality suspense, and quality character development. nothing in this show was ever interesting after season 5 for me. i watched some videos on youtube to know what happened after season 5, but i got tired of watching this because the sensitive audience that watched this show prevented characters from showing rape, genitalia, all forms of torture, and so forth. game of thrones will never hold a candle to the books that it is loosely based on. starbucks cups prove how increasingly incompetent the showrunners became."
2020-03-02,jimmy-51803,Wow,10,absolutely awesome!!! the last season let it down for me but overall was a really good show.

2020-11-29,muhammedraeess,THE BEST,10,"i usually don't like stuff based on medival era but this series... i'm shocked that how i got addicted to ityou just can't get enough of one episodei was watching whole day this show and completing one season per day, i wasn't like i wanted to watch it or complete the season per day, the show itself was addictiveif i didn't need a sleep then i would have completed all 8 seasons by watching non stop, just for the sake of sleep i had to break the chainonce you start watching it, you get hooked to it, you can't stop watching then, until you complete all the seasons"
2021-07-30,fionam-43725,Last season doesn't count.,10,i'm giving it a ten because i truly have counted the last season as a fan creation and not official cannon. therefore there are (in my mind) 7 glorious seasons of game of thrones. but if you must include the last season then it's an 8.5.
2020-09-01,michelliaghassani,A series that has everything on it,10,"this series is stupendous, in their earlier season, and always gives me chills. there's no doubt that the season 1,5 have the most well-written storyline. everything is in its place and they would finally get the answer when the dots are connected.
there's dwindle in season 6 & 7, then come the worst season; season 8.this series is that special and beautiful. you could see everyone point of view. you could see the dark side of human and how greed could turns someone into. we could love and hate a character in one time, this series is just something. there's no enough words to explain about how great got is.however, as i said, season 8 is the worst season (for me) and here's the reasons why:throughout the seasons, we would always get pictures of how great, magnificent, and mysterious the night king is. i remember, there's a scene in the night king's castle with a baby. i always curious and wondered about who is he, what is he, how can he be that powerful and dreadful. but guess what, he's been killed, by arya. no doubt, the first time i watched that war, i was amazed and thrilled, but once i rewatched it, isn't it too easy? i thought he's that powerful. and the worst one, there's no further explanation about who he really is and how can he be like that. i think i'm just going to read the book.we all know that daenerys would turn into the cruel character, seeing how she's been portrayed all this time with her idealism. but i don't really get it, about how the war in king's landing could be that chaotic and she suddenly just burned the whole city. and of course, she's dead, killed by jon.i actually have never imagines that what i read in twitter, several days earlier, would become the ending of got. bran is the king. i could accept it now, but the scene where people listen to tyrion, even though he's my favorite character, just bother me. i mean, he's a prisoner at that time and why would you listen to him? i understand that they want to become a democracy, but the execution to get there just doesn't make any sense at all.if there's one thing i enjoy from season 8, it must be sansa become the queen of the north."
2020-09-10,joshtjj,Winter is coming,3,"game of thrones is not only a great fantasy epic, able to rival titans like lord of the rings, but also a masterclass political drama. indeed the show had amazing visuals and a sense of scale that no other show has had, but it's best qualities were it's huge ensemble of great characters, brilliant and talented cast, and genius dialogues. game of thrones could have gone down as the all time greatest show, but its poorly written and hugely disappointing final two seasons will keep it from claiming that title. nevertheless this show is definitely worth a watch."

2019-05-06,dawnrzr,Great apart from S8,8,"i've really enjoyed got as a whole. not everything has been perfect, but most shows are like that, and this is not your average tv,show.. this is an extremely rare genre - a dark fantasy show, i'm willing to cut them some slack. it's too bad about s8 though, i even liked the previous, rather fast paced season (which many people despised). episode 4 of s8 really ruined a lot i think - it's overall sloppy and just plain dumb, very little effort and thought was put into it. you can tell the creators just got tired of it but continued due to it still making the $$$. we never asked for this."
2011-11-02,phantasy_star_4,Best Television show I Have ever seen.. And thats saying Something!!!,10,"i read game of thrones back in 2000 it was amazing i made all my friends run out and get it as well. i just recently got the chance to see game of thrones threw hbo go and it brought back all my fond memories with ten times the amount i couldn't have even envisioned in my own head. its true to the book and the visuals are breathtaking.sean bean just happens to be one of my favorite actors of all time but honestly all the acting is so good i cant believe how good it is. even though i love seans skills i have to give it up to kit harington as he pulls off snow so brilliantly, although i shouldn't say that because there has been not one person within all episodes that has not done a top notch job. the music is fantastic and the sound effects divine, except on one occasion one the first episode where it showed horses being rode in the snow, the sound effect was that of horses walking on a road rather than a forest with snow (should of been soft followed by crunches fellas lol) anyway this show is an easy 11 out of 10.i hope this series goes on forever. game of thrones was the only reason i picked up hbo and if it stays on hbo, hbo will forever be purchased in this household."
2011-04-28,old_man_from_scene_24,Absolutely top-class!,4,"being a big fan of george r. r. martin's ""a song of ice and fire"" series, i had very high hopes when i heard that hbo were turning it into a t.v series, and was expecting to be disappointed. as it turned out, disappointment didn't even cross my mind whilst watching the first episode.two episodes shown so far and ""game of thrones"" is already in my top 10 t.v shows of all time.the acting is superb, with no actor/actress delivering an unsatisfactory performance , they stay completely loyal to the characters george r. r. martin created, and the results are always fantastic. the dialog and attitudes of each character are very typical of a medieval fantasy series, which shows that the actors and developers alike have managed to perfectly capture the atmosphere of such a time and place. the setting is exactly as i imagined it would be after reading the books published so far, with the haunted forest being particularly unsettling at the start of episode 1. so, top marks for that as well.the effects used are never over-the-top, which i always like to see in either a movie or t.v show, as some movies have to rely solely on good visuals to win over an audience (avatar springs to mind here...).perhaps the best thing about the t.v show yet is how loyal it remains to the first book of the series. every important scene, and some of the great witty remarks of certain characters, are played out to great effect exactly as they are written. the one thing that the t.v show does not remain loyal to is the age of the stark children, lannister children and of dany. however, this is perfectly understandable, due to some of the scenes the children are involved in (no spoilers, but suffice it to say, they are pretty shocking at times, particularly in dany's case).all in all, i have to give ""game of thrones"" 10 out of 10, but not just because i am a huge fan of the book series; because it is a superb show, with excellent acting, a great realistic atmosphere, terrific sets... and it manages to remain loyal to its written counterpart amidst all the inspiring greatness."
2016-08-02,aryassen,"Good visuals, actors and atmosphere, but...",10,"...i don't understand why is it so special. my friend gave me the first 2 books as a present years ago (knowing i like fantasy and good sci,fi), with his personal recommendation. i couldn't get through the first half of the first book. now my other half got the series, and we have watched the first 2 seasons, so you can say i don't have the full picture yet, but on the other hand i feel i have had more than a glimpse. with so many positive reviews, i'm sure i'm the odd egg...but my issues are the following: 1) the balance always seems to be off for me (example: winterfell is a capital, but it can be taken by 20 men, when even without garrison they say there were 200 ""northeners"" inside...it looks like the size of a family farm in one set when showing the inner courtyard, then in the next set showing from the outside it's like the size of the castle of dover...decide already, please: either is fine, just be consistent). 2) politics are way too prominent for my taste (but, if one likes that kind of storytelling, i can understand its popularity). 3) nudity and sex again is much in front, and while i have absolutely no issues with sex, in a fantasy show i find it excessive (and so cheap) that half of the story seems to revolve around it (yes, of course it is important, but this much? really? what are we, 13?) 4) so many twisted characters, so little sanity. i wonder how this whole realms survived at all with so little common sense and ground, but it might be again a personal thing...for me, it is difficult to like a show with so few likable characters (and having some more characters with a bit more sanity or moral composure wouldn't make them or the story ""one-dimensional"", i think) 5) magic on the other hand (in general) is way too much in the background. example: they said the birth of the 3 dragons are the most important and relevant happening in the last x hundred years, and yet in the entire 2nd season the same dragons (including scenes when they are talking about them) got maybe 10 minutes of screen time (if that - but we have lots of tits instead, every 10 minutes or so).that being said, it is transparent that a lot of effort went into the show: most of the actors are doing a fabulous job (and the rest are still good, at least in my view), the visuals (including attention to details) are great, the music is excellent and contributes to the overall atmosphere (which is the main reason i'm still watching this and will continue to season 3). i just wish it would be more fantasy and more storytelling, with less cheap sex/sexual references and fewer ""imbalanced"" (to put it mildly) characters."
2014-01-30,gattobuono,Don't Trust the Stars,1,"they say you should never judge a book by its cover. likewise, you should never judge a film or tv series by its imdb rating. there's not much that i can add to the criticisms that have been leveled at this pretentious, humorless and vacuous twaddle, especially as i only just managed to get to the end of the first episode. but from what i've read, nothing much changes, and i've certainly got far better, if lower rated, shows and films to spend my time watching. i'm sure that if i was about 13 years old again i'd love it, but it's a total mystery to me why it has so many 'adult' fans. i guess a lot of people just lead boring everyday lives and need to escape into this kind of childish fantasy."
2019-05-25,kaspard,Great series with a great ending,9,"it is really a shame this many people didn't see the events in season 8 coming.... many people are complaining, while the finale is actually the best possible way for this story to end! it all fits perfectly. daenerys has been losing it during the last few seasons. i really can't imagine how people didn't see that coming? it only makes sense tyrion didn't see it coming. for the first time in his life he had found someone he could look up to and who he thought he could trust.... of course varys wasn't blinded by daenerys' presence, so he did see it coming. unfortunately no,one listened to the master of whisperers.... people just didn't want to hear the truth (just like many got 'fans' still don't want to hear it...).there are great similarities between daenerys and many real world rulers who thought they could change the world into a better place, no matter the costs... daenerys' character was actually inspired by hitler. and still people say her story isn't realistic at all.... take a look at history. that's as real as it can get.also i've seen complaints about cersei's death being totally non-heroic.... that is however the entire point of it... cersei considered herself to be bigger than life. for her to die anonymously in some basement by a cave in is the worst way for her to go. no songs will ever be written about that pathetic death....i loved all 8 seasons and can't imagine a better ending for this wonderful series. 10 out of 10. without a doubt.and to everyone who's complaining about season 8: please watch the entire series again and see the incredible amount of hints and clues that gave away it would all end in disaster like it did.... just like tyrion and like john snow you have been blinded by your total faith in daenerys being the saviour that would put an end to all injustice. when watching it a second time you may not believe how you didn't see this coming the first time watching it. it was that obvious! and it really the only proper way this story could have ended..."
2013-09-23,jan_lebbe,Why do people always compare series with books?,10,"my title says it all. why do people compare series or movies with the books? series or a movie can never be as good as a book! i almost never read books but when you read a book you use your imagination and your imagination is always better then seeing series. just to say that the comparison is pure rubbish. you can compare series to series, movies to movies and books to books but not compare a series to a movie or a book to movie, etc.. some of the critics here say that the cast is bad. i dare people to make a better cast for this show, especially peter dinklage as tyrion lannister is superb. i never read the books and i think game of thrones is awesome. maybe it's because i never read the books, maybe it's because it's just a brilliant show. but only for the opening credits you can give this show a point or 2 extra. i say this without any doubt in my mind that that is the best opening of a show ever made.for the people who compare this to lotr. yes, it's a bit of the same scenery with the knights and the fortresses but except for that they has no similarities. lotr is mostly known for their epic battles were game of thrones is more about honor, love, betrayal,... . and as i said movies can't be compared with series. this is a perfect example. in series it's much more about character building with lot's of characters were movies focus more on one character or like in lotr they focus more on the mission of destroying the ring and the story around that. you can say that the ring is the main character in those movies. game of thrones has lot's of main characters (the lannisters, the starks, daenerys targaryen, jon snow, theon greyjoy, etc.).what i think about this show is that it's the second best series i've ever watched (except from breaking bad). if you like a well written, well acted fantasy series with lot's of drama, action and humor you should watch this show. you will like it !"
2013-08-02,dannov747,Exceptional storytelling with unmatched depth,10,"i'm not much of a tv show fan. and while i recognize the greatness of recent dramas like breaking bad, mad men or house of cards, it is very difficult to get so invested in the characters there, and i don't think i've ever waited anxiously for the next episode. and that, is what game of thrones does better than any other series, it makes you care for the characters, and it keeps you waiting for the next episode. game of thrones isn't the best tv show out there, that honor would probably go to the wire, but it is shocking that despite not even being held in our world, it is far more fascinating.the best thing about this show is it's unsurpassable depth, especially in seasons 2 and 3, which have focused more on the characters. personally, i used to watch this show casually, and skipped the parts i didn't like while asking my friend to remind me what was happening. it is massive and it's hard to keep track of everyone, and so a casual viewer might not agree with my statement of depth. as a casual viewer, i thought so too at first. i didn't like the talkative season 2, or even the beginning of season 3, as the show slowed down there.but during a very boring summer i decided to invest more in the series. i went to a wiki and read the characters backstories, watched every episode again and then read through the first two books. the more time i spent on the series, the more i noticed how deep the story is.i also think, contrary to many other opinions, that the show is steadily improving, despite the fact that the plot is slowing down. it's focusing more on the characters, which is fine with me, considering that they are the most interesting ones out there. the lannister males, tyrion, jamie and tywin, in particular are some of the best characters in any show, ever.the first season suffers from sexploitation, and second and third seasons have talkative episodes that aren't always interesting, so i'd give it a 9.5/10, but since that's not an option.. 10/10"
2017-11-09,shahbaz-khan79,This TV series is magnificent! And Its Awesome.,9,"i was absolutely shocked to watch the pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. the language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. it stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. if you enjoyed what you saw in the pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""game of thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. i would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.a special note to viewers that have not read the books... keep watching! this series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. it may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait"
2019-01-16,pwolf-900-528634,A Modern Masterpiece,8,"first sopranos, then breaking bad, and now game of thrones. we are all living in the greatest times for entrainment, through the tv series.the characters, the storyline, the script, the acting, the cinematography, and the attention to detail makes game of thrones, hands down, the king of television.if you don't like stories about fantasy or medieval times, but you enjoy watching great stores, then try the first 5 episodes game of thrones. by then, you should be hooked."
2019-05-21,humanmud,Thank you,5,"this was a great show i enjoyed while i watch, thanks for this 8 amazing seasons, yes even for the last episode u gave me 7 good seasons and 2 good episodes from the last season, i will read the books now thanks for that to, u left a mark in my lifetime, thank you."
2020-10-27,cborg2505,The last episode was the only misstep,9,"best show of all time, hands down. only issue with season 8 was time. it was rushed and should've had multiple more episodes. way too many narratives left untold after a decade of almost flawless development. each episode of season 8 by itself was enjoyable, except the series finale. with the exception of a handful of decent scenes, it was a complete disaster. but anyone who says the entire series was ruined because of it is an idiot imo. if you're one of the very few who havent seen it, ignore the manic depressives with the low ratings and watch it."
2016-12-07,tomgoodwin815,The most overrated TV series in history,5,"after seeing hundreds of ridiculous reviews calling game of thrones 'a masterpiece', 'the finest piece of tv ever' etc, i felt as though i had to explain that this is simply not the case. a 9.5 rating on imdb is baffling, to be honest, as there are literally tens of thousands of titles that deserve a better rating than this series. having watched the first several episodes of s1 and selected other episodes from various other seasons, i can confirm that this series really does not live up to its reputation. not by a long way. truthfully, i actually found it rather dull, and lacking anything of real interest. i'm convinced that about half of game of thrones's audience is most likely teenagers who simply watch due to the large amount of nudity/sex scenes, because that's really the most notable aspect of it, and that isn't even necessarily a positive factor. i've read some of the books by george rr martin, and they were far more enjoyable than this, so if you want to know the game of thrones story, i strongly advise you to read the books rather than sit through 60 hours of this nonsense. it's nothing but a chore. but if you're looking for a tv series that could actually, realistically be considered a masterpiece, there are many other and let's face it, infinitely superior ones. breaking bad. true detective. lost. these are just several of the shows that i guarantee you would find far better than this, and they prove that game of thrones getting a 9.5 rating is, quite frankly, a joke. if you're thinking of watching it, please don't waste your time. there are better shows out there."

2019-05-20,muathq1,This TV series is magnificent!,9,"after 73 episodes, you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. overall, i think, it won."
2019-05-22,xiphoner,"Despite the horrible writing in Season 8, still a brilliant series overall!",4,"game of thrones is a masterful adaptation of g.r.r.m.'s fantasy novels, with absolutely impeccable acting, cinematography, music (score), special & visual effects, and for most of the 7 seasons , incredibly good writing; intricate storylines, profound character development, great storytelling, and insanely immersive plot. all of the above is not true for season 8 though.so, what was wrong with the final season? and why was it so bad?the problem is not that character x died, or that event y happened. the problem is how it happened, aka how poorly it was written. people who defend d&d under the excuse that ""fans are angry because they wanted a happy ending"" or similar crap, are just blessed with ignorance & lack of perspective so they managed to enjoy the good visuals of the final season and ignore the massive dip in quality of writing & storytelling.the last 4 episodes of season 8 written by david benioff & d.b.weiss. who evidently didn't care much about the show at this point. they had gotten a deal with disney and started working on star wars, so their writing in the final season of got was extremely lazy, full of retconning & plotholes, continuity issues, and logical errors..in an interview from a few years back, the author of the books g.r.r.m. said that he originally wanted 12 seasons for game of thrones, but the aforementioned showrunners d&d wanted 7. they went back & forth for years, until the latter finally agreed to do the 8th season. they didn't even want to make the last season, which is evident from their awful writing.it's hard to rate the show with a 10/10 after watching the atrocity that was s8, but it's also hard not to give it a 9/10 because most of the first 7 were incredibly well written & executed seasons."

2019-05-21,gotrek_fabian,The best fantasy TV show ever (Very minor spoilers),9,"score breakdown: seasons 1,6 = 10/10
season 7 = 8/10
season 8 = 7/10
overall, still a 10/10 due to the sheer pleasure i got from this amazing show. forget what all of the naysayers spout about it's ending and the imbecilic 1/10 ""reviewers"".with game of thrones we have not just the best fantasy tv show but one of the best tv shows of all time.
the tv show is based on george rr martin's epic masterpiece (yet to be completed), a song of ice and fire and named after the first book in the series (this was due to only one season being funded initially as it was unknown whether the public would take to a fantasy tv show) and for the first season it's sticks very closely to the penmanship of the novel. as of season 2 there are omittances and alterations and the further into the novels you go the more changes there are but this is not to say that it makes for a bad experience.the overall story is one of a political struggle for the iron throne of westeros, a monarchy in the land of westeros whose capital city is king's landing, and an ominous threat from the uncharted north beyond 'the wall' whose existence is a threat to all mankind known as the white walkers and led by a mysterious wight called the night king (the beings in the novels are known only as the others and the night king doesn't exist). the person who sits on the throne never does so for long and the ruler of westeros changes quite frequently one way or another.the most endearing quality for me is the way that characters are written as multifaceted beings which endears them to me so much more than stories with two dimensional heroes. there a bad guys with good and redeeming qualities and there are good guys with altogether disgusting traits or horrid histories which makes for much more enjoyable viewing. it causes you to wonder which side of that character is going to surface on plot points and keeps you gripped within their stories as well as the overall plot of the show.game of thrones has changed the way tv shows are thought of today and the way tv shows are made. it is a game changer the likes of which will not be seen for some time to come. it shocks, disgusts, causes great ponderance on what is to come, confuses and delights in droves and every episode will leaving you desiring more.the show has its flaws towards the end, mainly due to grr martin having not written the final two books yet (the winds of winter and a dream of spring) and the directors, benioff and weiss, having to write the script themselves. the impact of this is apparent to anyone who embroils themselves in the show with time passage becoming a little odd as well as characters acting somewhat erroneously and making choices which seem odd for their personalities. this is not a major detractor though and is only apparent due to the high standard which this show set itself from the very first episode. even at its lowest points this show still surpasses nigh on anything out there available for your viewing pleasure today and if you haven't seen it then take a chance on it, even if fantasy isn't your thing. after a couple of episodes you will likely be hooked (i truly envy you if you haven't yet seen it!)."
2019-05-14,besseling_nina,Why all the disappointment?,10,"i dont understand why everyone is disappointed. okay, they could have done a better job. but don't you think the expectations were a little bit too high because of the loooonnnggg wait?
i think its still great. the change of the caracters, the good being mad, i like it.
there is still one episode left and i can't wait to see it!"
2020-05-04,anticurous,Still number 1,2,"as pretty much everyone knows more or less the theme of game of thrones i'll give a short review: so, the plot is based on the continent of westeros which is comprised of 7 kingdoms (the north, the riverlands, the eyrie, the westerlands, the reach, the stormlands and the crownlands), dorne, the iron islands and the land of always winter which is divided from the rest by an enormous ice wall. noble families, who control each kingdom and their bannermen fight over the iron throne and the control of westeros. all the while a force of half,dead walkers arise after thousands of years in the land of always winter. the story is mostly based around the starks (noble family of the north), the lannisters (noble family of the west and the rulers from the shadows) and the targaryens (the family that united westeros with the help of dragons) which was exiled and banished to essos (another continent). the first 6 seasons are phenomenal! politics, wars, intrigue, mysteries, pacts and betrayals. a lot of characters are perfectly described psychologically (especially cersei lannister, tyrion and tywin lannister, catelyn stark and olenna tyrell). yet, season seven was kind of rushed, while season 8 was disappointing to say the least. anyways, you should definitely watch it! the plot lures you into their world, you become nervous, paranoid, sad and happy and you really attach to the characters."
2019-04-15,surreyreviews,Still over hyped and dreadful,10,"glad to see the back of this appallingly over acted, dreadfully scripted, over hyped tripe. it should not have lasted pass season 1 , it survived based upon hype only and the masses lapped up this chewing gum for the eyes. having sat through several episodes at the request of those who bought into the hype, it just shows how low the bar has been set for literary works - it's been rinsed for every dollar it could take out of the hands of those who follow it like a cult. dreadful, but at least it about to die and be confined to the history books of television, unlike the rotting corpse of the walking dead that even andrew lincoln could not run fast enough away from - they really are about to inflict yet another full season of absolute garbage on the public with such unrealistic story lines it's farcical. if you enjoy such shallow trash as escapism from life good luck to you and i hope it lives up to everything you want it to be and more."
2019-05-22,joseph_f_klatt,Gripping Journey to a Disappointing End,1,"seasons: 1,7.5 were great! very edge of the seat and will keep you sitting on the couch watching episode after episode until you realize your whole day is gone and you have to get up for work in the morning.seasons 7.5-8
horrible, horrifying, terrible, miserable, dull, doesn't make any sense. asking why, and why again!? thinking any fan could of wrote this better. characters are out of place and doing things they wouldn't do. the writing is garbage and lacks effort. they threw an end together that seemed fair to them and tried to make everyone happy i guess but they had no passion in it. the whole got team let their fans down to say the least.you can have a great movie/series but if you can't finish with a good end, then it can make it feel like the whole movie/series was all for nothing. that's what happened with got."

2016-06-07,klarsichtgerda,Bring in a new Interesting face - Tino Struckmann,3,"this is a good show that potentially could be better, however what so many tv shows seems to lack is new faces. i suggest, from having watched most of his movies that you bring one of the csi supporting cast tino struckmann with you on this new endeavor and give him a bigger part. we need new faces just like his. he can act and does not look like all the other boring actors and he have chops. i know most series casting or execs do not read reviews but as a fan and somebody in the industry i wanted to open the door for new talent deserving of your attention. a veteran who does his own stunts, knows hos to hold a gun, he started on e,ring and lead a bunch of indie movies but it is time he gets a break. he became known for his book on women's safety and have his heart in the right place. he in originally european and know how to swing a sword."
2017-07-10,flaviaj1991,A show with ups and downs and definitely overrated.,10,"let me tell you something. i've never read the books and i don't intend until grrm finish all this damn books, if one day he will do it. i watched all the seasons up to now, and i intend to finish it, but even much i enjoy the show, i can't deny that the story taken certain directions that disappointed and displeased me.in the first half of show, the story had great twists and episodes really memorable and awesome as ned's death, the battle of blackwater, the red wedding and all the exciting fourth season. unfortunately, there was a decline of certain characters in lasts seasons. daenerys was an incredible character in beginning as a conqueror, but after she took power in meeren, she's simply annoying now. all plot in meereen was boring. and what about tyrion? after he fled from casterly rock, his story seems to have lost its charm. the hard truth is that he's now just the shadow of the man he was. he was terribly wasted in the last seasons having been reduced to a mere comic relief. arya, in particular, what the hell she did in the last two seasons, i cannot say. her excellent and entertaining interaction with the hound gave way to a boring and wtf training in braavos, and the show lost a lot with that. about dorne, i don't even need to comment. was ridiculously ridiculous.as for the end of stannis, i don't know what to comment either. the character had one of the worst plot outcomes i've ever seen. and rickon stark? he died as he lived: being totally useless. and even when the show was at its best, there have always been some freaking stupid and bizarre things that sound too exaggerated and out of place in story, which has a more crude and realistic tone in itself. i can easely accept the dragons and the ""mediumistic"" bran stark abilities why they fit into a medieval universe. but i can't stand melisandre giving birth a freaking shadow that killed a guy and then disappears like smoke. what? and there are the zumbies and the arrival of the white walkers, that i never give a damn.this army of ice zumbies often feels shifted from realistic political universe in got. seriously, this plot sucks.the positive points is that stories of jon snow, sansa and bran became much more interesting in the last seasons by far. it's cool to see jon snow standing in his rightful position and sansa finally standing up for herself. bran's character, by the way, has finally gained some meaning for me now. i hated him until season six, now i really like him. hodor's death was touching and surprising. the battle of the bastards was epic. so, not everything displeased me.i don't know if season seven and eight will be able to lift the fun and surprises that were the first half of game of thrones. the show feels somewhat lost amid so many changes, and seems to feel the weight of having lost so many interesting characters along the way."
2021-06-05,joomie0208,Masterpiece,8,greatest series of all time. the first time i watched i did not understand why daenarys was killed. i watched it a second time and i can say that the last season was perfect!

2019-10-10,florianleiss,Wasted potential,10,"seasons 1 , 4 = 10/10, season 5 and 6 = 9/10, season 7 = 8/10, season 8 = 5/10. overall score 9/10could have been the greatest show of all time, but unfortunately the writers made the last two seasons with so much unlogical crap and bad character development. kinda sad, i really loved this show."
2019-06-21,iljas-94273,"A perfect show with, unfortunately, not a very good ending",7,"the writing of this show was amazing through the first seven seasons. i was impatiently waiting for the last one, which definitely wasn't what i expected. i don't mean that the ending must satisfy absolutely everyone, but this was just really rushed forward and couple of questions remains unanswered. of course not all of them could be, the series is a masterpiece and so elaborated, they just couldn't fill all the endings they intended. but truth is, the writers themselves set the bar too high. is jon snow azor ahai? what is the intention of the white walkers? these are the two main questions i would love to be answered and i would rate it a 10 star show, nevertheless the ending was just pitiful...on the other hand, the story was very well written, the characters were brilliantly portrayed and described with a story on it's own (my personal favorite is stannis baratheon), the cgi was marvelous, the acting was outstanding by most of the actors, the costumes, the battles, just all of it. i must admit i loved it. it's just the ending that left me unsatisfied... i personally agree with most of the fans who think they should've made it at least 10 seasons, to wrap it up nicely."

2021-06-08,shubhamcritic,Overhyped. Unnecessary sexude scenes to attract audience,9,"honestly, i never understood the hype for this show. the story is not unique, moreover too many side plots are just distractions. one can easily avoid this."
2021-08-02,rahulsalunkhe-03045,#1 In My List,6,"this series top me a lot also others who are fan of this. this series covers every type of aspect which is needed in any movie. from romance to politics, from darkness to murders. everything. if we just keep aside season 8,this show sets a limit for other shows. from versatile acting arch to filmography, everything is excellent. now let's peep into season 08 , everything went so rapidly due to rubbish writing and plots, actors story arch is destroyed brutally. #restorewesterosabout actors jaimie, cersei, daenarys and jon snow played well till s07
tyrion and sansa were in their character till end
arya and brans character went far away which was hard to swallowand the end, it's worth watching
we can't judge the whole show based on their last appearance
love you westeros and a good farewell from us."
2021-05-03,madmaxnightrider,One of the Best Shows of All Time!,10,"what can i say. almost everybody loves this show unless you are a prude & don't like violence or nudity which this show has in spades. this show is just about perfect. the one thing i would say is bad about got is it can be hard to keep up with all the storylines for each character because there are so many. it is perfect except for all the stories going on at one time. other than that it is a perfect 10. it has everything going for it. it has action, characters, plenty of story, great acting, great cgi & beautiful women."
2021-08-25,selenabella-87251,The show should of stopped after season 7,5,"just imagine , night king and his army, along with viserion, broke through the wall, went over to the other side and killed literally every living thing they could find. the end.how amazing that would be? like seriously tho - there would not be ""what if"" theories, people would not be able to discuss how that and that person ended up, no one would fight over if bran is a good king or not... every single character would just be dead, which would mean everyone got the exact same faith. it would be the perfect ending.but the writers just had to ruin everything with season 8, did they? smh..."
2021-01-03,alitahir-01043,Still worth watching,5,"if there was an award for the best produced tv show, this would have it. hbo really didn't spare any expenses with this one. the cinematography, the visuals, the special effects, and of the incredible soundtrack, all made this slightly imperfect show worth watching. had the last 2 seasons not been ruined, this would've been a solid 10."
2011-05-26,charwoman,Quality HBO production,4,"i'm not a huge fantasy fan, but i am a bit of a sucker for anything brit,flavored and anything period, even if i can't always choke them down in the end. with historical productions, disappointment often comes with too many liberties taken with the facts. literary adaptations suffer the same problem for those who have read the books. i hadn't read the martin books when i gave this series a try, so i had no expectations. however i was wary because starz's pillars of the earth, which i also had no expectations for, turned out to be such an overwrought bag of cheese, full of bad writing and direction and what must have been a closeout purchase of chicken-bladder neck-blood- spurters. then camelot (also starz) lost me in the first 20 minutes, and after that i had no stomach to even check out the borgias after seeing what showtime did with the tudors. but with sean bean and peter dinklage, i thought game of thrones was worth a try, and it has been.the production values are fantastic, and the acting and writing are very good, with only occasional forays into excess. the violence and gore are kept in context, although the sex and nudity are a little heavy-handed at times, probably as a safeguard in case the plot lines turned out to be too complex for some viewers. i found the story compelling enough to download ""a song of ice and fire"" to my e-reader after watching a couple of episodes. it's not a perfect creation, but it's very well done and as others have said, each episode makes you anxious for the next, and without the need for cliffhangers and sensational devices, just a desire to keep going. bean and dinklage are indeed both great as ned stark and tyrion lannister, and mark addy unfolds as an impressive and flawed king robert. having liked nikolaj coaster-waldau in the short-lived new amsterdam, it's good to see him back at work as the arrogant jaime lannister. michelle fairley is a formidable catelyn, and maisie williams as young arya stark clearly has a great career ahead of her. in fact, most of the acting is solid-to-excellent. sometimes the story line with the targaryens and dothrakis seems a little too over the top to match up with the very naturalistic feel of the rest of the series, but it's still interesting, and i look forward to seeing how it intersects with the rest of the tale. although it's not vital to the story, the opening sequence is beautifully done and worthy of mention. hbo generally doesn't half-*** their projects, and they certainly didn't skimp on this one. worth a watch."
2021-07-10,angryleprechaun,Fantastic.. until season 8,10,"season 8 is the finale of got and it is just horrible. d&d had to write the season and they messed it up badly. character arcs get thrown out of the window( pun not intended), ending makes no sense and all characters have become dumb."
2021-10-23,theashcritique,We needed more season...!,8,"top episodes season 6 episode 10: the winds of winter
'for more than 15 minutes of amazing soundtrack by ramin djawadi with the plan in place, i was just blown away by how you could actually manage to keep almost an entire episode with no words just music and you just cant blink.. how the director executed this episode was enough to make me admit nothing can ever compete'season 6 episode 9: the battle of the bastards
'season 6 just took us somewhere else. this is the kind of episode thats going to make you enjoy cruelty and how euphoric you will feel about revenge'personal opinion:
i loved every bit of this series, eventhough i once said i would never watch it. the acting, the directing, the stories, the links, the new languages, the photography, and the shots were all perfect and engaging, even with 10 episodes in each series. it's the only series that i wouldn't get tired of even if it lasted 20 seasons, and trust me, it wouldn't been enough to explain all the strings he pulled. if there is one thing thats bad about the series, its that it definitely needed more seasons to wrap up everything, yet no matter how he could have ended it, no one would have been satisfied.'you can't live without watching it, even if the ending is bad, because this series is going to take you into a whole new world and reveal joy you didn't know'nb: if you just started watching, you might feel a little bit confused and off track.. keep watching, it is going to spice up after the episode 'baelor' season 1 episode 9."
2011-07-23,tomsan84,overrated? in my opinion; yes,9,"first of all, ill say that i didn't read the book, nor did i ever heard of it. second; i watched the first 6 episodes so far (thats 6 hours).most reviews are mainly positive, but many of those are written by the book readers. if one feels that you have to read the book to enjoy the series this review is not for you.this series is a drag. i think thats the best way to describe it. its a never ending introduction of people whom may become important later or whom may not, you don't know for sure. its about intrigue, backstabbing, leadership, honor, good, evil all that.. but it doesn't deliver. some things happen, and if it does the show will definitely let you know ""something"" happened. even if its not that special it will become the main part of the story for to long. six episodes is almost 6 hours, nothing 'epic'/'grand' happened. all six hours is talk and no show. you might see a sword fight or two (not much more), but no battles or some breath holding scenes. even those who love this series cannot deny this. there are no real scenes in it, which will 'take you away', in lack of better words. so far, to me, this is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. you keep switching from story line to story line, and although they are put together nicely it just gets boring after an hour or 4. once again i'd like to state that nothing really happens. there is one thing this series does. it somehow keeps you interested. i think i know why. its because the story lines that are plotted out continually give you the feeling something grand is going to happen. i had that feeling since episode 1, but it never delivered. they set,up this epic wars and battles that are bound to happen, but they don't. i imagine something will happen soon enough, but its too late imo.i am not watching dragon ball (or am i?). i don't want to watch 6 to 8 hours for one action episode. that makes it a soap. i am all for 'complicated'/ extended story lines, but not this. its to much. to much characters you need to know, to much different protagonists, to much parallel story lines. acting wise, i am not to impressed (also not disappointed). its hard, because there are to many lead-roles. the big roles are filled by competent actors. in this aspect they do transcend a soap, but there are many roles that are filled with lesser ones. (for me; jaime lannister and jon snow don't hit it)i am not shy to sex-scenes. i am from the low lands and we like to make sex the main basis of all our movies, but come on. the abundant nakedness almost makes me think someone is compensating... for lack of action that is. sex scenes are fine, but imo to much emphasis is placed on some in this series and that makes it a bit weird now and then.to conclude; i actually don't think my comparison with dragonball, for the ones familiar, is that bad. one battle could last a season. in this case a season is comparable to the preface of a dbz episode. it only remains interesting because they constantly talk about grand wars and actually ride to war since episode one, but the 2 out of (the?!?) three sword fights are fought with wooden swords (not kidding) and my patience is starting to evaporate soon."
2019-05-20,febangel30,Last Episode-Disappointing,7,"my husband and i were hooked by the first episode, season 1. the character development was amazing with each new season. many characters were not black and white, therefore you connected with their personal flaws. i took off 3 stars for the last episode. it was a slap in the face to all got fans worldwide. i agree with many comments online. it's as if the writers ran out of ideas and just winged it. wth?!? i understand the frustration. we deserved a better ending. at the end, it did not make any difference that jon snow was half targaryen and heir to the iron throne. he was banished to the night watch to do absolutely nothing because he killed his queen. the same queen that stood parallel to cersei when she killed a multitude of innocent people because was ""mad"". i do like that he reunited with ghost and the wildlings. sansa received exactly what she wanted, to rule the north. as for brandon being appointed as king of westeros, i have reservations on that matter."
2011-09-18,javier1976,Excellent adaptation,8,"hbo did a great job with this show. i was afraid they may not follow the source material (like amc did with ""the walking dead"") or that their depiction of certain events and people/creatures would suck) but i was pleasantly surprised. all of the cast members did a great job and most of them really fit the characters their were assigned. the production values are excellent, everything looks as if this were a big budget film, it really must have cost them a fortune to make this show. except for a few (mostly minor) exceptions they were really true to the book and all of the major events were shown with as much detail as they were in the book. however there were some changes i didn't like. the biggest one is the age of the ""children"" (the starks, baratheons and daenerys). almost every single one (except maybe arya) is way too old. rob and jon are 14 in the books. here they look to be in their late teens or early twenties. the same goes for daenerys, she is supposed to be 13, here she looks like 20. in her case it would be somewhat understandable since the producers were probably concerned about showing a 13 year old girl f*cking like she does, but in the case of the boys i see no valid reason for the change, and considering that the events in the books so far span a few years where you see the characters growing older the decision to cast older actors seems rather nearsighted. the biggest age difference is from rickon (also known in the show as the invisible stark :p). in the book he is about 2. here he must be 6 or 7 at least. another thing i didn't like were the scenes that weren't in the book, like the ones with the spider and littlefinger or the homo,erotic scene between stannis and loras tyrell and the ones that are in the book but not in the show, namely the battles. there are only 2 battles in the first book but we only see their aftermath in the show (and in one of them an important fact -certain deaths- is not mentioned). i can understand that this may have been due to a time constraint (they were trying to fit the entire book in a mere 10 episodes) but if it was due to budget constraints one has to wonder what are they going to do in he following seasons? books 3 to 4 (i haven't read 5 yet) have dozens of battles, some very large (including a naval battle), that are essential to the plot. if they choose to only show their aftermaths that will certainly detract from the show."
2016-07-29,lordlucansghost,I don't get it,1,"you can have as many big stars in your film or series but it doesn't necessarily make it a winner. if you've seen the cannonball run 2 you'll understand where i'm coming from here.i'm sure there are some quite good plots among the series and i won't criticise that, but the acting is unnecessary. when you go to see a play at a theatre the actors will, even if there supposed to emphasize whispering, will shout with much drama. this is so the people at the back of the audience can hear what's being said. you don't need to do this on television, they use microphones and the audience has a remote to control the audible volume. in game of thrones however, the actors have obviously forgotten they're no longer on a stage in front of a thousand people, so they carry on in the usual shakespearean fashion and that for me completely vanquished any interest i may have otherwise had.now the thing i don't understand is this , the show has been on for about 5 years now, but it's only in the last year/18 months people have started talking about it. no wait, going f***ing mental about it. why?! why now!? to some people this show has become a religion and that's fine, but they're also folk out there who enjoy voyeurism and that's umm....fine too."
2019-04-29,lilly_unique,TV show that is superior to everything else on TV,5,"game of thrones can no longer be categorised as 'just a tv show'. simply put, george r.r martin's creation has become a cultural phenomenon. the greatest compliment that you could pay game of thrones is that there isn't a character who feels 'wasted' because every single person in the show , regardless of their time on screen - is memorable."
2011-07-08,fowler190,100% Flawless TV,10,"an amazingly strong cast of britains best actors and actresses work alongside some of their quality stateside fellows. a strong script taken from a well loved series of books, weaves and creates a place populated by real people where the cut and thrust of normal life plays alongside the epic nature of the royal and knightly families. scenery, wardrobe, cgi, etc all maintain the highest of hbo's standard.i am sure there are some, aka the ""twighlight"" type audience, who will find this story too complex, too ""wordy"" and too epic to grasp. but those of us who loved hbo's ""rome"" and the screen epic ""lotr"", watch this series with wonder and a big smile on our faces.......raymond e feist's ""magician"" next please.all at hbo take a bloody well deserved bow......."
2020-03-05,iplagerquist96,Great until it wasn't,9,"the first four seasons of the show are the best television you'll ever watch. seasons five and six are great and season seven and eight are ok and bad. this is what i tell everyone who asks me about the show. i binged seasons 1,2 and then watched season 3-8 on a weekly basis over seven years up until the very end. it was something i looked forward to ever week and it hardly disappointed up until the last season. there was thought put behind every scene, every character decision, and every line of dialogue. there were consequences to every action (even years down the road). everything had a purpose which is why the show was so addicting and so satisfying. however, the last two seasons (some would even say some of season six) started to show some wear and tear. certain character decisions and motivations didn't line up which at first was ok but then it kept happening. by the end, specifically the last three episodes, nothing seemed to matter and the choices were laughable. sure it looks great visually but everything else was bad. a show like game of thrones needed to nail it's ending because, at it's core, the show was about who gets the throne. when you crash and burn this hard, everything that came before seems worthless. i might one day watch the show from beginning to end but for now i'll cherish the great moments that we had and there are a ton."
2013-05-25,azhark14,All round fantastic take on the fantasy genre,9,"this is the best thing on telly at the moment!!watched the first episode without knowing anything. doesn't give anything away but certainly sets the setting. the whole package is brilliant. from the opening credits, to the marvellous acting from young and old characters alike. i must admit i am not too keen on british films or dramas but a majority of the cast are british but they do a sterling job.each episode invites the viewer into this mysterious world where power,love, magic, deceit,honour and much more all intertwine. what really makes this show are the characters. there are so many unique characters in their own way , their parts have been played so convincingly and they essentially make the show.hate them or love them you will certainly appreciate quality performances from this cast.only criticism is season 3 doesn't quite live upto the other two - and of you are lucky enough to have not watched them already - watch the episodes consecutively --you'll be so hooked you wont have the choice."
2019-08-05,canberk94,1 point for season 7 and 1 point for season 8,10,1 point for season 7 and 1 point for season 8. i wished the author written the scenario instead of the dumb&dumber.
2019-05-20,aaronet,The end was beautiful,10,"yes season 8 was rushed poorly scripted, but the arc of the story from s1 is in tact, this is the outcome that grrm wanted, constitutional democracy, we should have seen it coming all along, knowing that it is based on english history. amazing story. shame the execution was spoiled in final season, still 10 for me."

2013-04-03,kidjay83,-9.4 rating is more like it (Horrible show),10,"where do i start first of all this show is hor,rible like a car wreck where a family of four gets mangled and killed horrible. i'm not trying to be mean i'm just going based off my observations.i will break this down as simple as possible.acting : not good,if i were to rate the acting on a iq scale i'd put it at 50.which translates to being mentally retarded, the writing is some what to blame but.if these actors had any really good talent that was above average.they could make the show much better even with sh*&^% dialogue.why any self respecting actor would chose to be on this show,is a sign that there is no good actors here at all.at least any with good judgement or integrity.any actor with real talent would only be undermining themselves by doing this garbage.plot: dungeons and dragons with lots of violence and lots of sex.just think of eating something thats way overcooked and.you're pretty much getting the same thing here.luckily this show has a built in audience or else it would of sank along time ago.the main ingrediant for this show has become just to shock and confuse people.to keep them interested which is usually a sign that the creators are struggling to keep this show afloat.even going as far as throwing in the sex sounds when peter dinklage is getting his knob slobbed.it's like they had prepubescent boys in the editing room;working the sound effects.writing:i doubt there is any writers ,if i had to guess i would say they are just pulling dialogue right from the book verbatim.overall the show is held together by gum and paper clips ,theres only so many times graphic violence and sex will work .there was a scene where one of the male characters is giving a monologue with two female actresses.performing sex acts on each other while trying to sound serious i felt embarrassed for the actor and actresses that had to put up with that.this show has absolutely no substance what so ever the best advice i can give is this .if you want to know what this show is really like don't go to someone who is a fanboy of it .they will just sensationalize it for you.which will just winde up misleading you to wasting your time watching this junk.this show trysway to hard and doesn't deserve any of credit for its efforts. i wish imdb allowed for negative numbered ratings so i could give this a proper rating.epic fail"
2012-05-01,chrisdmeads-304-886334,An addictive adult fantasy series,10,"for those of you who love fantasy watching game of thrones is essential, and for the stereotypes who view fantasy as a tale of magic and princes, thrones will change your ideas completely. game of thrones is an epic fantasy with an incredible character driven narrative and set against an epic backdrop of violence, nudity and sex. it's essentially a tale between 7 feuding families fighting for dominion over the mythical land of westeros and the fascinating struggle for power that ensues. the plot is full of twists and turns that makes for a compelling drama, that is set in some of the most stunning locations witnessed on tv. breathtaking location like the frozen fortress of the nights watch and the rats nest of a capital that is kings landing, provide the viewer with plenty of eye candy, whilst confirming this shows status as the most ambitious piece of work ever to grace tv. the production values and high quality script writing both contribute to the overall quality of the show, with quotes like ""try to penetrate the enigma that is me"" and ""winter is coming"" soon becoming common household phrases and typifying the quality of the people who work on the show. however it's the characters and actors who portray them, that make this show truly great. from the witty dwarf tyrion lannister played by the excellent peter dinklage, to the noble ned stark played by the legendary sean bean,to the feisty daenerys targaeryan played by the beautiful emilia clarke, thrones oozes quality in the character and acting department. even some of the supposedly minor characters like the slippery informant varys,the loudmouthed greatjohn umber, the mindless oaf hodor and the infamous mercenary bronn all manage to be intriguing in their own way, which highlights the vast array of unique characters thrones has. thrones manages to keep the audience emotionally invested in its various characters, whether you are rooting for the honorable ned or cursing at the scheming lord baelish,there is a character everyone can relate to. overall thrones is a sophisticated adult fantasy that doesn't hold back, and hbo must be commended for their faithful adaptation of the a song of ice and fire series of books. the sheer gore and sexual activities encompassed in the series makes it a uniquely entertaining experience and not one for the feint hearted. lord of the rings this certainly isn't, game of thrones reinvents the fantasy genre in a stylish sort of way, which is a credit to author george rr martin and show runners david benioff and dan weiss."
2019-05-28,alexalinia-554-626627,"Great shows defined by their ending, GoT will not be defined as a great",6,"never a major fan from the start, it was entertaining, but certainly not the greatest thing, certainly didn't live up to the hype. but all the greatest series are all defined by their last season. got team seemed to have just gone on a massive bender throughout the whole of season 8. squeezed it all in 6 episodes, probably cos they just wanted it over with. they got all their success and thought ""who cares dude, we're done"". scripting was shocking, acting was meh and the last episode dragged on for the sake of dragging on to just take a few more hours of your life.weak, lazy, ignorant and disrespectful to the fans who wasted 7 years of their life on this show, only to be rewarded with this pile of filth"
2020-07-07,snadarsh33,Definitely the best series till date.,5,i have never waited for the next episode of a tv series like i have for game of thrones. if you are deciding on wheather to watch it or not then the answer is please watch it. a definite recommendation.
2019-06-30,michaja-kravanja,Season 1-7 {9} Season 8 {4},10,"after the x,files this is the best show i ever watched until season 8 happened. i just cannot believe that i spend so many years of my life on this. how can you have such amazing characters and story lines and come up empty in the last season on all fronts? did they use up all of their imagination? the only good thing in season 8 are the effects. visually it is breathtaking but it just didn't make any sense on how they ended the show. like no sense whatsoever. why invest so much time in character and story building if you're not going to do anything with it except for ruining one of the best fantasy series ever. i am still in mourning i am at anger right now. angry at how they insulted me as a viewer. it's going to be difficult watching the series ever again knowing how it ends. i just have to re-write the ending myself and use my imagination to give this amazing show and it's amazing characters the ending they deserve. dracarys!"
2019-05-22,agentzero-626-226027,Michael Bay on line 1....,9,"so, imagine you are given an amazing gift. i mean, the gift of all gifts, handed to you on a silver platter and arranged in masterful sequence and unity. you take this gift in all its superior glory and wonder....and choose to vomit on it, defecate on it, and then procede to pass it on to all of your friends to do the same.this is pretty much what the writers of got did with season 7 and 8. they took what could have been a true masterpiece of television and turned it into michael bay meets james cameron. even with the utter tortuous drivel that is season 7 and 8, the bulk of the series holds enough water to sustain an 8 rating."
2020-05-04,adolloway,"Don't be stubborn, just watch it",10,"millions of people arnt wrong. it's brilliant and gory and you'll love and hate people, you'll follow so many journeys and you're guna want to be apart of it. the ending, well that's up to you to love or hate."
2013-08-10,thegoodthebadthesmugly,Worth the hype,10,"i was reluctant to start watching this, mostly because i am *so* unique and different (in case you missed the sarcasm in the text, i'm being facetious). in all seriousness, i don't know why i avoided it for so long, but i wish i hadn't. this series is awesome.i also didn't realize that it actually delved into items such as dragons, witchcraft, etc. i really, really like it and i'd recommend giving a few episodes a shot to see whether or not you like it. please don't judge it on the snow scenes. that is the only storyline that i seriously don't get, and wish was cut out , i feel like those people have been lost in the snow for forever."
2019-06-30,tbhamfog,I liked the ending.,6,not a popular opinion but as a reader of books it seemed like the right ending how ever unsatisfying to some. to me the anticlimactic end to jon snows story was fitting because life is not about 'happy endings' life just is. all our lives are affected by people in power luckily for most most of us the future of man kind is not on our shoulders. love the story got told looking forward to 'bloodmoon' and seeing the story it has to tell.
2015-05-05,marcookka,Started out well but...,9,"it is an amazing show in many perspectives and i can see why people loves it. i did to. the show started awesome but a bit into the second season pace began to fade. in season three, it was obvious: inspiration for daenerys targaryen must come from moses' 40,year wandering in the desert home to israel from egypt. i have completely lost interest in the series, although i'm impressed by the production and all the actor's efforts. the series has produced many exciting characters and let viewers get acquainted with many new promising actors / actresses. veteran actors has popped up to the surface again and proved their greatness. game of thrones has lots of qualities and the series has in many areas outperformed everything else that has been shown on television before ... but ... the lethargic pace sucks the will to live out of me. sure, things happen... people are dying and the new ""wild cards"" are thrown into the game. the problem is that it does not feel as if it matters. i'm not against the drama part but it feels like the awesome entertainment is suffering from drama being to stretched out and not leading anywhere. the series has not reached its end yet so my review is not engraved in granite but i no longer following series after the 4th season. likely i'm going to see the rest when the entire series available on itunes or similar. i rate it 5 stars because it at this point bores me. who knows? maybe i will restore the 10 i gave the show after season one after i seen the last episode?"
2019-04-23,launrol_9200,WHAT'S GOING ON???!!!,9,"i am extremely disappointed with this show. i used to think that game of thrones was the best series ever created... but now it's half trash. everyone can clearly see that the series is no longer based on books. and all the mistakes that the series has made, to the point of ruining it little by little has been because they have not followed the books. let's be honest, the writers in this series do not have the intelligence to finish this story the way it started. now it's a cheap hollywood comedy from what it used to be.these two episodes of the last season deserve a 1 in qualification! what a pity, dialogue, history ... it's been a waste of time. this is why i hopefully waited one year and a half of my life?shaaaame!! shameee!"
2020-04-11,jacob-pavelka-13,Seasons 1-4 are Great. 5-7 Acceptable. 8 is garbage.,9,"i know it's in style to be rude towards shows on the internet these days. however, as a reader of the books which form the basis for this show, the final season has ruined all rewatch potential and forced me to mentally separate the show story and book story completely. if i accept that the books will end exactly like the show, including the nonsensical character decisions, elegant plot armor, and destruction of characters, all the time i've spent pouring over the five books of asoiaf would be wasted.i love game of thrones. i really do. but i had to change my 10 star rating to 4 stars because of the final season."
2015-06-14,dave-goodman-130-352295,Absolutely riveting,2,"peter dinklage and charles dance...absolutely brilliant, my boys kept on at me to watch this show for a few years so i obliged by sitting down and watching episode 1 of season 1. a week later i had got through to the end of season 4. i am just about to watch season 5. i have to say this has been one of the best tv shows i have ever watched. i cant emphasis enough the brilliant acting of peter dinklage who for me absolutely steals every scene..with the exception on occasions of charles dance. the cgi is fantastic and the action sequences are excellent. it took me a while to fathom out who was who with all the names/houses etc but once i got my head around them it was brilliant."
2019-05-15,davemanson,What happened?,1,"there's still one episode left in season 8 but it'll be hard to redeem this season. it's an absolute mess that tears down everything it's built up to this point. the plots are cliche and lazy. long running story arcs are thrown away and replaced by neat and tidy writing that's as safe as it is uninspired.
what a disappointment and a sad end to a once great show."
2020-08-31,saha-aritra-no1,Final season was so bad that I went into depression,1,10/10 for first 7 season. 1/10 for the last season.
2015-02-19,faiza_khan,Love love love,1,"okay i admit it, i never thought i'd be watching a series such as this. i only started watching it because one of my favourite footballers watched it! and i was so addicted, an amazing show with a great storyline. i love how some of the characters are so lovable and others are not. my favourite definitely has to be tyrion lannister, arya stark and jon snow. its so hard waiting nearly a year for the new season to start again but i'm glad there are books which i am hoping to read soon. it can be quite difficult to grasp the storyline at time especially because i am not used to shows such as this, but listening carefully and sometimes just googling stuff i don't understand really helps. i finished all four seasons in four days which as you can tell i was very much addicted. i would recommend all viewers to watch!"
2019-06-14,asnaker,The story is everything,9,"every story has a line beginning,plot-ending if any one of these not good enough the story will be bad, and that what happened in game of thrones."

2020-05-19,manojmagecha,Did someone say mild porn?,1,"what a load of rubbish, watched 10 minutes of it where three women approach a witch, the witch then tells them there future. the garments they wore reminded me of 'lord of the rings.' half naked exposed bodies, terrible script and something like an 18 rated disney fairy tale."
2019-04-14,attakaay,Realistic and Bold,10,"it's undoubtedly the greatest series of our time. it's going to be nearly impossible for any series to beat it, right from the awards scene to fans mobilization. game of thrones takes it all. have read all the books and i started watching game of thrones the same day it was aired and it's no. 1 for alot of reasons. you can't easily bank on what to come, character complexity, landscape, make up, vfx, archetypes are presented, destroyed, and rebuilt, sorry telling, the politics and art, there is no better show with so much and details. it's the best there is!"
2019-04-30,oldupai,What were you thinking?,1,"there are a lot of things to like in the series. but these last 2 episodes (season 8) were a downer for me. in episode 2, i understand the quiet before the storm, but the pace was so slow, and the acting was so flat i had a foreboding omen. episode 3 had better be a killer!it wasn't.who exactly advised you on strategy? you guys had a castle to defend (from the inside. behind tall structures called walls). maybe you thought that parking your entire army outside the walls in parade stance against absolute darkness was strategy? maybe you thought that throwing basically your entire cavalry in one suicide attack in the dark was a good idea?that is the most ridiculous way of throwing your forces into the fire!have you ever heard of ""the last charge of the light brigade""?such a disappointment."
2019-06-26,x-06791,"For me, it ends at season 8 episode 3",7,"i recently rewatched the final season and i still have to admit that despite the fact that the last season is quite disappointing, it is still so far one of the best shows i have ever seen. i first rate the got 10 out of 10 after watching the s8e3, as i literally love this episode. the fighting scenes are epical, and the way how they end the night king is, well a little bit rushed, but definitely acceptable and within expectation, more importantly, the night king theme, my favorite goft original soundtrack, is so fascinating that make me love this show even more. however, things get a little bit out of control and disappointing when i watched the following episodes, i was like holy crapped when danny decided to burn down the city and killed all those innocents as such behavior is not logical and not what danny can possibly do. danny has always been my favourite character in this show, even though many of my friends favored john because he always made the right decision, (i can tell they must look horrible when they saw john killed danny lol), i love the way how danny grew up step by step and eventually become a true leader who is willing to free the world and make some changes. i even remembered that i defended for her when she burned down kings landing and kill all the innocents, my original comments were like people sometimes do things because it feels right even if we deeply know it's wrong. honestly, i can't imagine why/how danny could possibly do that, that's not her, but i loved her so much that i somehow forced myself to find a logical explanation for her behavior, and i have to say that what i did was really childish and stupid lol. but it was not until when i saw john stabbed danny in her heart, did i finally realize that ok, there is something wrong with this season, all those characters are not what i have known for.but i don't want to blame the screenplay writers or anyone else for it ends in a way that most people can't tolerate. this show did bring me lots of happiness, i was a high school student in china when i first watched it and now i have started working and became a pr in canada, what a timescale. i'm sure that this show must also accompany many other people through their different stage. all in all, despite some imperfections, i truly love this show and all the characters in this show, and i am really grateful to watch such show."

2019-05-20,jennydeane,Game of Thrones used to be my favorite TV show...,9,"...until season 8. game of thrones will live in infamy as the example of how *not* to handle a final season. it's sad how such a compelling, magnificent story could completely go down the drain in only 6 episodes, and end a captivating show so simplistically and cavalierly. d&d, everyone is sorely disappointed.but please note , season 8 was garbage mostly because seasons 1-7 were stellar. if you're considering whether or not to start the trek into game of thrones, be forewarned.before season 8, i'd have given it a 10/10. the bold twists, outstanding dialogue and character development, and amazing sets, costumes, effects, and music placed game of thrones onto another grading scale altogether. but by that same token, my extremely high expectations were not met in its final moments - where (and i think most fans would agree), it matters the most."

2019-05-20,phoenixunderdog,If you're wondering if it's worth to watch the series,8,"in my opinion 100% yes...the first seasons are rock solid, after they adapted all of the released books and had to come with their own ideas and stuff the quality dropped yes but...as long as i know the finale is very similar to what will happen in the books so you can take it as a recap of the final books (that's for season 8) as for season 5/6,7 they had some really good episodes and even if they weren't as good as the 1-4 they are way better than most of the tv shows these days...the acting is amazing like 99% of the time, visuals/cgi/shots are really well done and realistic for the most part...overall it's a cool experience and this show will be remembered as a big part of tv history for decades...just have a good time and relax ;)"

2021-02-24,joshpulwaski,Season 8 destroyed it,10,girl power bs strikes again.... it's getting old already. let's try for a realistic balance in the future. this final season made me cancel hbo
2020-06-16,juliaroqs,I have yet to see a better show.,6,this is the best show i have ever seen. the only downside to this show was the last two episodes. even though the last two episodes were very disappointing to fans the show is still just unlike any other show. there are so many characters and many different story lines all going on at the same time. if you haven't seen got yet i highly suggest you do! there is a reason so many people have written reviews like this one!
2020-03-30,annemariepaarden,Amazing series,10,"this is one of my favourite series of all time. this show had a great mixture of everything: great production, storylines and character development (except for season 8, let's not talk about that), amazing sets, actors, and soo much more. i admire the amount of work was put into making the episodes, the complicated storylines, the people that make sure every little detail is right, and just the overall outcome of each episode. although season 8 was a huge dissapointment, only because the writers didn't properly take their time to finish it, overall this serie was amazing to watch and i always looked forward to watch a new season or episode."
2020-06-09,nagasa-49255,The Best,9,"based on the best,selling book series ""a song of ice and fire"" by george r.r. martin, this sprawling hbo drama is set in a world where summers span several decades and winters can last a lifetime. from the scheming south and the savage eastern lands, to the frozen north and ancient wall that protects the realm from the mysterious darkness beyond, the powerful families of the seven kingdoms are locked in a battle for the iron throne. this is a story of duplicity and treachery, nobility and honor, conquest and triumph. in the game of thrones, you either win or you die."
2020-07-05,jayjaye4,Game of thrones,10,"best greatest tv show ever created from the cast to the scenes to everything about game of thrones makes you want to keep on watching, there will never be a show as good but shame about the last moments of it"
2020-12-28,valeriorinaldi-36361,A Great Show With A Poisonous Last Bite,10,"watching ""game of thrones"" has been an immersive, charming and engaging experience. the first seven seasons have been well structured: episode by episode the characters have grown and have shown such a complexity and depth that even the unbelievable becomes credible.their storylines align, intertwine and part along the seasons and even if the plot becomes more and more complex it's easy to follow the whole story and grow fond of heroes and villains alike. the viewer may love them even more knowing that, living in a dangerous and treacherous world, any of them can be unexpectedly killed.alas, the creators made a huge mistake when they tried to be even more original and unpredictable by suddenly altering the main characters psychology and personality, disappointing millions of spectators, who felt betrayed by the inexplicable distortion of their heroes' words and actions.the series is truly entertaining and the actors and actresses' performances are sublime. it definitely deserves a chance."
2021-03-26,aarondoherty-19653,Game changer.,10,game of thrones is simply one of the best tv shows you can watch. season 8 was sorta a disappointment but not all fans will like the ending. great story throughout the whole show keeps you on the edge of your seat. game of thrones is also visually stunning and has a beautiful soundtrack. the character development is on point and really is one of the best shows on tv.
2021-04-27,afero-24481,"A dissapointing ending, but a great journey",9,"even if season 8 was a massive quality drop compared to other seasons, i can't emphasize how great seasons 1 to 6 were. don't let the critics stop you from watching this show just because of the ending, the journey is worth it."
2015-02-17,leopold005,"Violence, gore, sex and swears. And an engaging plot, too!",4,"i'll start out by saying i've never read the books. i've been told repeatedly that i should, but thus far i've never taken the opportunity.the very first episode of this show featured gore, death, violence, bad language, nudity, sex and incest. but, luckily, also had a strong plot and some very engaging characters. and throughout the four series that have been shown to date, nothing much has changed. it's still packed to the gunwales with all the same sort of action and each of the key characters' plots progress nicely and, to a varying degree, with some realism within the realm of the environment.i do have a few issues with the series, though. firstly, the lowest common denominator facets of sex, nudity, violence and swearing are a bit much at times. it's definitely uncomfortable viewing with your mum, i would expect! secondly, some of the story lines seem to either drag along or peter out without any real crescendo. granted, it's probably more realistic that some situations just play out with little consequence, but occasionally you'll follow a storyline that really engages you, just for it to tail off disappointingly without any real conclusion. thirdly, some of the story lines that drag on are now becoming a bit difficult to untangle from the newer plot,lines. apparently, this is a fault with the author and not the script writers, but it does make some episodes dull and others a bit hard to follow.but on the plus side, there's some really good characters who are hugely engaging. the lannisters, as horrible as they are, are all strong and played well by their respective actors. with the exception of tyrion, who is different because he's not horrible, just machiavellian. i actually find myself rooting for him when he's in bother because he's such a brilliant part and played to perfection by peter dinklage. screen junkies say he's down to play every cool dwarf part until he dies or warwick davies kills him, and they're spot on with that. but even outside of this key family, the parts are very well played.and the most intriguing part is that, even with the backing of hbo and the clearly us levels of funding it has, it's actually a british programme! it makes me proud to see that our little nation can still produce such incredible shows, and yet sad that we need our american cousins to fork out for them because we're too busy churning out crappy reality shows."
2014-06-18,joshbaileynch,Over-hyped nonsense,10,"firstly a confession , i hated this tv series so much that i only made it to the end of episode 6 before i gave up - i figured if i couldn't be won over in six hours it was probably never going to happen. given this fact the reader should be aware that some amazing transformation may have taken place later which make this series far better than i am giving it credit for - though everyone i've spoken to who likes the series thought it was great from the start so i'm guessing the quality (or lack of it) is pretty consistent throughout. my objections? firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s bbc shakespeare production a lot of the time. the series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness. i have absolutely nothing against the fantasy genre - the lotr books and films are great - but this is a weak addition and i'd recommend avoiding it."
2017-07-24,magyarrose,Sex scenes are affectless take offs on pornography,8,"there is no caress, no foreplay, they get naked right away, the female lies back passively, the male penetrates and that's it. people watch this and think this is good sex? this might work in pornography, but this is the reason why divorce is rampant: women get tired of this bull where their chances of being fulfilled are next to null.these sex scenes show folks to get naked right away and spread your legs, to roll on top of her then roll off. it is absurd and makes me hate these shows for propagating such false ideas. the true idea is that most women are too modest to rip off their clothes, ant that's not the most erotic way to interact anyway. the real news is that women need caressing and foreplay. the sex scenes in these shows (like say ""spartacus"") are sexist propaganda, and as a woman watching, it really makes me mad."
2019-05-14,sharad-seth,"It was one of the best, until...",10,"...season 8. a great series, with fantastic and carefully crafted story arcs, slow and steady character build,ups, and a very taut, fast paced story line in spite of the show being spread over many years.
and then somehow the entire team came under pressure. to finish everything so rapidly, and so haphazardly that it ended up destroying the brand built over all these years. all the hard work thrown down the drain so that the series could be, literally, wrapped up.
pointless and very sudden deaths of important characters (lord varys, jaime), sudden goodbyes to others (ghost), and worst of all, the mindless conversion of daenerys into an evil monster just in a matter of moments, without warning, and like her dragon breathing fire on the city, the writers and directors of this show have actually breathed fire on their own creation.
i think i speak for others as well when i say that deaths and departure are not a problem at all, we are used to that, but what everyone has become more used to, are the fine ways in which the stories and characters are crafted. and this one quality is somehow missing from what is supposed to be the best season, given that it is the final season.
i wish the team would have learnt something from breaking bad, or the wire, or true detective, or perhaps many others. they really know how to end a serial in the most emphatic and satisfying way.final verdict - disappointed by the finale. and i am very sure i am not the only one feeling let down."
2019-05-17,sharad-seth,A big let down!,10,"this has been one of the most depressing turn of events of late. what was easily a 9+ rated serial and seen such a major fall that it's almost unbelievable something like this (season 8) could actually be written by those who are supposed to write the grand finale of something really as grand as got.it's as if someone was hell bent on burning the legacy of got to the ground (much like the burning of king's landing) , all carefully crafted character arcs thrown down the drain, strange and totally uncalled-for character turns, sloppy writing, and sloppy production as well (is it some coincidence that only in season 8 we see a coffee cup on the table?).this series deserved so much better. perhaps the writers and directors should learn something from the makers of breaking bad, true detective, the wire etc. the ending of any series is a golden opportunity for the writers and directors to send themselves to glory - but here the team has probably made sure that no one ever employs them again."
2015-08-10,gabrielka214,Reading or watching?...Reading definitely.,9,"i cannot understand why this series is so successful. i guess it's only because of the violence, sex and nudity displayed plainly within that draws people to watch it. the story of the whole concept is nothing they care about. first of all, the title is wrong. ""a game of thrones"" is only the name of the first of the seven books of the heptalogy of ""a song of ice and fire"". maybe it sounds a bit more attractive, yes, but it's not the title it should bear. the most annoying thing about it all is that the characters are much much older than they actually should be, twice the age and also not captured well. e.g. joffrey baratheon has become one of the most hated characters, but if you read the books, you may know there are equally vile characters in the story, if not worse. he shouldn't be more than 13, but in the series it is a 23 year,old lad who portrays him. daenerys should be 15, yet in the series she is a 30 year-old woman. and so can i go on and on. sean bean as eddard stark? really? he would be my last choice and arya was supposed to be skinny... second, why so much nudity and sex? i do not claim that in the books there isn't mentioned how characters are having sex, but it gets lost among thousands of other more important and interesting and more described adventures, and it's purpose is just to make a background and show us the nature of some of the characters. the books are not about brothels, the word ""brothel"" is just mentioned. all i want to say - if you read the books, why should you spoil your imagination by watching this? let yourself immerse in the great prose of george r. r. martin and let the series for those who prefer watching this horribly made adaptation over reading and letting their imagination free. my only question is how could martin consent to such an adaptation of his fantastic books?"
2019-05-20,miki-watt72,Fantastic show season 1 to 7,9,"i wouldn't recommend anyone watch this simply for very last few episodes dont fit with the story all the way through to this point. the characters in the last few shows dont even behave like they do again all the way through to this point. the ending could have been so much better, in fact they possible chose the worst way to end the show that they could have, it just doesn't make sense. dont waste your time and if you do, then know that it ends terribly."
2013-04-03,latinohabanero,Awesome Show,1,"the casting, acting, story,line, fantasy - well i could keep describing the outline of the show but there is no need for that, this is a great show, never before have i given a 10/10 but i have to admit this show deserves it, i hope it goes for further than 3-4 seasons, shows like this deserve to continue and i'm pretty sure everyone who has seen it would agree. season 3 is something i've been awaiting for quite a while and my expectations are to be met, i am pretty sure of that, as so far game of thrones hasn't let me down, season 1-2 were amazing, specially how they twist the story and play with the cast, overall amazing. -latinohabanero :)"
2017-07-17,rolly_dodger,Wait and see.,6,"first thing , all review sites should remove any reviews with ratings of 10 or zero. these are die-hard fans, with no critical faculties, and haters, entirely hostile to anything good. neither are capable of giving a balanced opinion.as a long time fan of got i am obliged to watch and i do get considerable enjoyment from the series. i want to see the story unfold and conclude.but my enthusiasm is being tested. inevitably the plots and character arcs, spun out in the early episodes, must be resolved or abandoned. for instance, the one eyed servant of the lord of light suddenly reappeared after many seasons absent.drawing these threads together is making things a bit crowded and a bit hurried. the various plots are jostling for attention. it's a symptom of episodic stories, perhaps an unavoidable one; the enthusiasm for complexity early on, bites the writers in the ass.and that's happening with got. so much to do. so little time.i will still be watching until the bitter end and still loving it but objectively, so far it lacks the quality and promise of earlier seasons.but i might be proved wrong. i hope so."
2019-05-22,dimitrisfotths,A cheap Copy / Paste from Tolkiens masterpiece Lord of the Rings,8,"i have watched game of thrones from the season 1 believing that it will be something good, i found many similarities and also many cheap copy patse from lord of the rings (ya dragons + dragon rider = nazgul , night king = cheap version puppy of sauron only worst cheap copy from the calling ""writer"" ) only that sauron is character full explained from tolkien . they added many porn scenes many brutal rape scenes and the most disqusting scenes from the sadistic creators was the killing of babies and little children . instead of lord of the rings who passes the learning to the people of the strungle in order to prevail against the evil and the darkness , game of thrones tries to teach people that you should be treachery person and killer of childs (like jon snow tyrion lannister), liar spoiled (sansa stark) , an assasin or a murdered or a killer of babies like (bronn or arya stark) in order to have a happy ending. life is full of lessons and the most hard lesson is when you lose a lot of time (which you can not replace in your life) to garbages like game of thrones. i will never read any kind of work from this so called writer martin and of course i will never never watch again any kinf of work of these retards who bring to the television this abomination show. don't lose your time like me to this garbage. i hope that someone one day will bring a series of lord of the rings prequel"
2014-03-10,seansnowden8,"Good writing, good acting, sex, violence, war, back stabbing.",10,"this show is a little over hyped, but is worth watching. i never read the books. fantasy is for total geeks, excalibur is a great film. i enjoyed the first season, i was surprised by the brave woman who act in this show. beautiful woman throughout. families fight over nothing other than keeping blood lines thick, always attacking with shallow threats, and lies, and of course battles for castles, building armies, killing families, et cetera. the stories do have a historical feel. the production and cinematography are outstanding. the amount of interactions (dialog) is soaking at times, but i read that it's following the books closely. do not get attached to the characters, they swoon in and out of the storyline, and then get murdered. there really is not much fantasy involved. mostly terrible sword fighting, throat slashing, blood squirting...ok 1 giant, 3 dragons, a crap load of stories about past kings and laws and fables, and that sorta crap. over all its good. except , the second to last episode of season 3, has some of the most violent bloody horrific scenes since scarface. it really shows how savage humans can be. i was totally taken off guard more than three times... this show can twist you inside/out that's for sure."

2014-05-20,thenineorders,Game of Gossip,10,"game of thrones is nothing but a glorified gossip girl set in medieval times. don't get me wrong, i am hooked in the series but for all the wrong reasons. the universe built here is mesmerizing and i am more interested in the mythology than the damn fighting for the stupid and uncomfortable iron throne. the books are even worse having to swing your machete at the overgrown drool of words upon words that one has to dissect carefully to get what the author means. i prefer the series over the books, they are cutting through some of martins' bulls*#% and keeping the storytelling more streamlined. i certainly can't stand ""fanboys"" because they become zombies blindly following something without questioning a single thing. in their eyes their idols are perfect and that is simply not true. we are all humans and not one single person is perfect. certainly not mr. martin who in an interview said that he doesn't owe anybody anything. well, i guess you managed to get your millions all on your own sir. i'm sure it had nothing to do with your blinded fanboys.the series, just like books, take too much time to make things happen. it is all word of mouth instead of actions. you know everything that goes on through somebody's monologue. whatever happened to show me rather than tell me gets lost in this series on an unusually large scale. i have to give series like defiance, and falling skies credit for at least trying to show me those hard to present scenes. game of thrones is simply put a colossal tease. shows white walkers and dragons and magic like sprinkles of salt on a stew causing them to stir excitement on the viewer then...nothing. no huge battles, no dragons are involved in the battles in which they have to be involved, no walkers are were they are supposed to be, all invasions and huge conflicts are solved in mere moments, that again, are told rather than shown. yeah, the blackwater battle was not as impressive as you fanboys want to claim it was. all these things happen on a larger scale on the books, here they've become nothing but a bunch of gossip. the producers are not even trying to invest and make the effort to show us this grand universe. everything gets reduced to simple words spewing out of the main characters to let us in on the entire plot. even the lamest soap opera makes an effort to show some of what's happening in their world.verdict: i love the mythology involving this series but i am not a blinded fool to think that this series is the greatest thing on television because it is not. you love it, that is fine. you hate it, that is fine. i understand both sides of the argument and both assume the complete extreme. i am humbly telling you that is worth a look to see if it falls under your taste or not. me, i just critically follow the series to get the conclusion to a story whose mythology has me hooked, but it does not change my opinion that is nothing more than a glorified gossip girl."
2014-05-14,filmdwerper,Stupid Fantasy Crap,3,"let me begin by saying, i hated this series. my two daughters love it, but i don't want them to watch it any longer. the only thing i remember from first season were tits. you can't create a series with only boobs in it. the story was very thin and it was confusing. there were too many characters in the movie. i didn't see any epic battles whatsoever. i expected nightwalkers and dragons all over the place. instead, i, and i stress, see boobs. only boobs. it was depressing, because my wife was jealous. she was so jealous that she went to have plastic surgery. it was a total nightmare in my opinion. the blond girl, she was like 14. they dwarf was annoyingly short for my taste. and they all acted like they were from the medieval times. i simply can say, i hated this series. but people seem to love it. and i don't blame for being short minded."
2019-05-29,nikolastojanovic51,Dan and Dave Send Their Regards,8,"i can perfectly describe the entire series in comparison to the episodes up until the red wedding.the entire series there's been ups and downs, deaths of beloved characters, dissapoinments and excitement. much like the death of ned stark which brought us sadness, and robs rebellion which brought us hope.and everything was going well for a while. we made our theories. we started building upon our imagination. it was all going so well.and then the red wedding a.k.a. season 8 came.the slaughter of the northmen symbolizes the slaughter writers were doing to the storyline, writing as well as killing a bunch of characters during season 8.catylns threats to kill freys wife is us making a petition for a better ending. and frey saying ""i'll find another"" symbolizes hbo saying we'll just make more prequels and sequels.finally, rob further represents the entire fan base and roose bolton stabbing him and taking his life represents dan and dave who literally took our hearts and love for this tv show with this ending.*dan and dave send their regards*"
2021-02-07,jaimesilva,"Amazing is some places, bad in others. More amazing than bad.",8,"i give this show an 8. maybe an 8.5 i say its acting is amazing
characters are good
special effects/make up, etc: best i've seen
writing is okay
dialogue, a bit repetitive, everyone talks the same.
there are many twists and turns.
really cool concept.the main issues i have is that this show falls apart after season 5. each one getting worse as it goes along. the ending is so bad, that, i don't even recommend watching this show if knowing that bothers you. if you take t.v seriously and analyze things, then you'll be disappointed. if you are more laid back, then you might not mind as much.just an fyi, this show doesn't really have a main character. if you like breaking bad and the sopranos because of its cool main evil protagonist, you might not like this show. this show is mainly about this universe that was created more than it is about any one thing or person.lots of gore, sex, and cussing, so if you're bothered by that, you might not like it."

Ends up being generic.,3,"the only thing i have to say about got is this:for years i thought it was the best show on television , i could talk about it for hours and could not get enough. now its ended, it is now merely a 'good show' that once was.the ending turned a powerhouse of a show into a basic hollywood ""we've-been-here-before"" predictable comfort."
2020-12-02,tbabukas,Honestly the ending is not so bad..,7,"i finally gave in and watched game of thrones and i definitely was not dissaponted. i see how well the show was done and the acting was amazing. i can tell you it is ""taxing"" to watch as my mind was saying the names of all the ******* families, characters, and betrayal. i definitely recommend a watch it and may binge it in a few years or so.in regards to the ending i don't see the end everyone is so angry about it. yes it seemed rushed and many plot holes in the last seasons (7,8) in addition to some tacky scenarios and unrealism. however the actions of each character made sense to me. the irony of it is i seem many reviews complain about the ending but offer no revision or how you would choose the ""ending"". many great shows have a tough time with this but i won't condem the show just for a rushed ending. i mean cmon i'm sure the actors were over it by then ."

2019-06-15,jakob-berge,Still the best TV-series of all time,10,"first of, a massive thanks to grrm for creating all of this, and to d&d to making this to the tv. season 1,4 is easily the best that has ever been made on tv, cinema or whatever. i feel people forget how great this story is and to hate the hole series just because the last season, that is so unfair. say what ever you want about last season but you cant deny that, i have never been so into any series like got and their drama, surprising twists, casting and different characters is so incredible. so yes you can say that from the part when d&d went past the ending of the book the show dipped a bit in quality. season 5 was unusally boring compared to the past seasons, season 6 had more highlights, and season 7 felt a bit rushed also, but was enjoyable and we had a big excitement for the last season.so on to the last season, firstly the hate got has gotten for their last season is disgraceful. im not sure people know how much work they have put in to make the 8th season. recommend people to watch the documentary, «the last watch» on hbo to get some understanding. (example: for the «long night» episode they are 55 nights outside filming).on to the season talk and negative parts: they had some flaws with its rushed tempo and lack of answering questions about nk and some characters development (jamie), and reasons behind their quotes (bran). if season 7 and 8 had been 10 episodes we would have much more explanaitons and that would have been better. i heard that hbo said that they would let d&d get more time to work with, but d&d refused, that is of course a reason to be frustrated, so am i. but hey, whats happend has happend. beside all of that, this is spectacular tv. the visuals, cinematography, set designers and especially music by ramin djawadi is oscar worthy. my fav episode is ep 3, it is just breathtaking to watch a battle scene for 120 minutes, and its epic drama reach hights that top some of the best scenes in got history.the story and acting is also pretty good if you ask me. so on to the last episode which have gotten the most hate. jon kill daeny, i didn't see that coming, but what was so wrong about it? daeny destroyed half kings landing and turned mad, she could not rule. when that has been said daeny should have gotten more time to transform from good to bad. to the king choice. remember the very first episode of season 1? their main characters is bran and also the first chapter in the book is bran, he has a very big role in this story, and should have gotten more screen time and should have been explained better the last seasons, but even so he is never mentioned. arya and sansa play also important roles in first season, the stark children and their journeys have been a crucial part to the story, so that they rule in the end is very understandable. bran started the first episode last ending by getting thrown out of the tower, he ends last season by getting king ( ok, he is mostly three eyed raven). full circle. surely people could not imagine a happy ever after ending with daeny and jon on the throne? the thing that really makes me mad is that 1.5 million people have signed up on internet to reacrate the last season. people have so high exceptations, no matter the ending people would have been angry. i don't think grrm would make so much difference in how it would end up, but let's see what his books ends with.to sum up, you are allowed to criticize if you didnt like the ending, but if you just think over how good the series is on every aspect, from start in 2011 to the end in 2019 we have to be grateful for how amazing this is. for me it will be the best show for all time."
2012-06-22,silentman01,The most imaginative series...yet,10,"""game of thrones"" to me right now is the best show on tv by a long way. to me, it would hold it's own even against the great shows of hbo from the last decade, which (at least to me) is quite an achievement for a series which has just concluded it's second season.this it achieves due to it's complete form as a piece of art. it has the best cast ensemble where character development is achieved with a fluidity that is hard to attain when you have so many major players crunched into ten episode seasons. it's writing is mesmerizing as the prose brings to the forefront many aspects which not only provides an intricate look into this fantastical world, but insights into the human mind in our world. there are great performances provided from it's cast coming from actors of all ages with the greatest turn provided by peter dinklage, who right now is probably the most favorite tv character and jack gleeson who delves into the evil side of a young king, who is a sociopath, with a realism you would not expect from an actor so young. it has at it's disposal some of the most accomplished tv directors who have directed numerous episodes in great shows such as ""the sopranos"", ""deadwood"", ""six feet under"", ""the wire"" just to name a few. the greatest asset of the show, however, is the vision of the writer of the best,selling novel it is based on, george r. martin and the visionary adaptation done by it's two creators, david benioff and d.b. weiss who have brought martin's magical world to screen with enviable perfection.the series deals with the struggle of many different factions who wish to control the iron throne which sits at king's landing in westeros. like any form of art which deals with power, it deals with many varying characters with different methods and motives in achieving their own needs and wants to ensure survival, power and other aims depending on the needs of the player who plays this dangerous game. it is immersed in a world filled with magic but it provides a realistic look into the thin line maintained between good and evil and who's validity is influenced by the ones who control the definitions through victory rather than with reason. even though the central plot to the series is the struggle towards holding or achieving the iron throne, there is another significant war without which this struggle would never go on. this ""other"" war is fought by the unknown and the rejected of society who hold the wall against civilization and are not accorded with the glory which is showered on warriors they protect. they live their lives in anonymity despite their sacrifices. the realm of the true unsung hero is portrayed through these guardians who are not how you would picture them to be and who invalidate all our definitions about heroes despite performing actions which being called heroic would trivialize their sacrifices.for all of you who have not seen this show, i have tried to keep the information to it's bare minimum because it is a must-see for every adult and it would be a crime for me to spoil it for you. if you want to watch something which is provocative, smart and unique, this show is bound to be your cup of tea. ""game of thrones"" to me is the most imaginative series of all time and has raised the bar on television like the select few shows that came before it and which shaped the quality of the medium during their existence."
2020-01-16,andrejsolehnovics,Greatest let down,5,"amazing 5 seasons were followed by 2 mediocre ones, which were still watchable before the last season (8) rolled out. basically, as soon as directors ran out of written material and had to use their imagination the things went progressively downhill. season 8 completed the transformation from great to below par. i have to agree with some other comments: season 8 made this show very hard to re,watch. but hey, they totally subverted our expectations, ryan johnson style.if the last season was the same standard as the first 5, it would make seasons 6 and 7 watchable too, but knowing the awful finale makes it unwatchable. just go ahead and watch only the first 5 seasons, maybe 6 and 7 too if you must, and then just pretend that show got cancelled - you'll feel better for it.it may go down as the greatest let down in tv show history. i can see it becoming a meme, actually."

2020-11-29,jacobse-07697,"Like others say, the ending ruined the show....",2,"i would have loved to give got a 10 star review,and i actually had it at that before season 8. thing is, this isn't a show where the bad ending is disappointing, but the rest is still enjoyable. the ending actually tampers with the overall show. by knowing how poorly everything plays out, the other seasons and their characters' motivations seem pointless in the end. there have been several other shows with disappointing endings that left the rest of the show still good enough to recommend to friends lost, dexter, etc. with got, i could not in the right mind, recommend this to anyone. the feeling of disappointment is quite frankly immeasurable by television standards. i will admit, seasons 1 through 7 were thoroughly enjoyable in my opinion. there were moments that really had your heart pumping, characters you cared about, etc. the show just had a phenomenal look and feel. the 8th season really has no redeeming qualities. like...even the fights looked awful. it's genuinely shocking how poorly it turned out. however, if you can handle the disappointment of the finale, then by all means watch the show. it's really amazing other than the ending. i just can't overall recommend it"
2018-06-09,theaalcazalc,Amazing,8,this show is amazing and what a wonderful casts. i can't wait for the season 8. winter is coming!!!
2018-10-14,geekhead,"Parts are brilliant, parts are stupid, acting is great",1,"it's hard to rate this show because the parts that take place mainly in kings landing (along with the storyline involving brienne of tarth and sir jamie) are excellent, like a medieval soap opera. the photography and sets are incredible, casting is great, as the acting is top notch. pacing does lag (a lot) here and there, but overall it's forgivable. but for those who are not fans of the zombie genre, that's where this show totally loses me. i couldn't believe they integrated such a stupid thing into an otherwise good show. i wish the 'threat from beyond the wall' would have been something less adolescent. i'm all for suspending disbelief and going supernatural, but zombies are not only dumb, they have been so overdone it's not even 'fresh.' some thinking outside the box and originality would have been appreciated. so for all parts that weren't zombie, i'd give it an 8,9, and for the zombie drivel, a 0. a waste of good characters and storyline, i found myself fast forwarding through all zombie scenes stopping only to hear dialog from main characters when i thought it might be relevant to other parts of the show.i will watch the last season to see how it all plays out at king's landing but it's not like ""i can't wait"" ... the only reason i will watch it is because the parts i *do* like are so good. otherwise, i wouldn't bother. and imho peter does steal the show and deserved every emmy. but everyone is excellent... even those at the wall whose storylines were relegated to the the stupid zombie stuff."

2019-05-20,toriw-36706,Last 4 episodes were disappointing,10,"my rating would be an easy 10/10 if the last 4 episodes of season 8 were as good as the rest. this show was incredible until that wall came down. many parts of season 8 disappointed me, like the night king dying so quickly, cersai and jaime dying because of ruble, dany becoming a villain, bran becoming the king, etc. however, i don't think it deserves as much hate as it gets. i liked episode 1 and 2 as much as the rest of the show, but the problem of this show is the writing and the writing only. otherwise, the cgi, effects, acting, shots, tone, etc. is amazing. great show until season 8."
2019-05-20,amanj33t,Watch Seasons 1-5.,10,"all the season after season 5 never existed, m'kay?d&d wanted to end this show as quickly as possible and it shows. i will forever be disappointed in them."
2019-05-07,iphoneiphone-31328,Season8 is not Game of Thrones!,10,"i understand that rr martin is not involved in season8, but who is writing this awfull script,a 4year old?! even the actors are not credible anymore. pathetic dialog and acting. did they change also the directors for this season? they should fire the ones who wrote this script and the one who directed ep.4 and ep.2. the white walkers may be gone,but the nightmare continues..its called season8! from 10stars,i rate season 8,with 1star.whoever is responsable for this mess..shame on you!"
2020-06-20,pajorieth,"great show, great final season",10,can everyone please stop hating on the ending just because their beloved sociopath queen didn't end up on the iron throne? thank you.
2019-08-28,itsnikhatreviews,Watch only if you are okay with a disastrous final season,10,"this was one of the best shows that i ever watched, but sadly that feeling as changed because of the final two seasons.s1,s4 are the best seasons of the entire series. the story is a brilliant masterpiece. writing is on point and gosh, the characters are amazing, it doesn't matter that they didn't have the budget equal to that of the latter seasons because this had quality content.s5 was when the writers decided to diverge from the books. though they had plenty of plot material to work with, they skipped a lot of things and started to merge many characters into one. you can start to see the cracks in the show in this season. certain plot lines are botched, but still, because of other time lines, the season is watchable.s6 - the writing gets picked up in this. many story lines seemed to be getting wrapped up. there are some stupid things which happen in this as well, but they aren't major and the season will still keep you hooked. it has some of my favourite episodes in it.s7 - here's when you'll really start to notice the drastic drop in writing and skipping of important scenes. extremely illogical and hollywood sequences replace what made the earlier seasons game of thrones epic. there is lack of continuity, character inconsistencies, and shock for the sake of shock, dumbed down characters who suddenly don't know what to do. upon my rewatch, i was able to watch only certain scenes from each episode.s8 - this is a perfect lesson on how not to end the series. the first episode is decent, and the second episode is really good! it felt like they had zoned back in on the essence of got (thank you bryan cogman for that! your love for the series was so visible in what you wrote!) but sadly, that's the last you will see of logical writing. the third episode is only visually stunning (except to people who are poor or don't know how to tune in their tvs because then you'll only be able to darkness - i had to strain my eyes and sit in a dark room to see what was happening and still missed most of it). there are many characters who should have died because of the circumstances that they were put into, but miraculously didn't. the next episodes are pretty much the same. only now, you can actually see what's happening. we don't go on a journey with the characters and learn to hate or empathise with them. instead we are teleported to the final destination told how to feel. this season had minimum dialogue, what dialogue we have is either repeated quotes from earlier seasons or some plain bs or multiple characters saying the same lines; important scenes are cut, reactions which we wanted to see are not there, it heavily relies on cgi. the way they arrive at the ending is unbelievably annoying. this season will end any rewatchable value, at least it did for me. i would also like to add that everything except the writing was amazingly done. too bad we didn't have anything decent to maintain the level of got. very clearly this needed more seasons with competent writing. it's extremely disappointing that one of your favourite shows ends so horribly that you don't feel for the characters anymore.would i recommend this to you? only if you won't get addicted to it and can tolerate a horrible ending."
2019-12-18,kathrynnsimon,CANT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS IS,10,"can't find any objections to got. i'm happy that i live in time when this was filmed. greatest serie ever showed.
don't miss it if you liked hobbit, lotr or harry potter. this is similar but bigger with excellent production and remarkable landscapes and epic scenes. i'm now on episode 3 of seson 8.
i can honestly say: thanks hbo for considering and later filming george rr martin books.
you gave me so much joy and excitement. wonderfull."
2019-08-20,sllkora,Game Of Thrones,10,"it is the best offer ever and will never come, i don't think so. thank you very much game of thrones .. i love the show"
2020-01-03,pushpakppr,Masterpiece with the exception of season 8.,10,"an unbelievable show spoilt by an believable finale. can't keep yourself away till season 7,after that it's just a desperate attempt to end the show."
2020-01-05,d_j_browny,Brilliant until a rushed final season,7,i watched this from the start week in week out and loved it! brilliantly written with a perfect cast. the show pulled no punches in just when you got a favourite character they were brutally murdered (the red wedding a perfect example). it was always going to be a tough task closing so many interluding stories in the final season resulting in it feeling rushed and with a lot of unanswered questions (not to mention how the 'all conquering' night king was killed by a kid) but overall it is one of the best shows i've watched and would recommend to anybody (unless they don't like sex and violence).
2020-08-05,azouzmanar,Worst series in the world,1,this is one of the diertist and worst series i have ever seen in my life. such a stupid story. i hate it so so much and it is disgusting
2020-11-06,shreerajn,Last season screwed everything,10,they killed main character dany the mother of dragon. they destroyed the story.. whatever she have done atlast they made her mad queen. stupid writer.
2021-02-07,alejoguerrerot,Amazing series - Too many seasons,10,"i love this series and could be perfectly a 10 but the last seasons were a bit disappointed, they create such a huge expectations and i consider it as a bad move, because at the end of the day looks as a desperate move which distorted the whole story, anyway there´s much more good things to say about the series as photography, characters, make up, scenarios, music... really well done and enjoyable."
2011-06-13,sashoh,A Song for the eyes and mind,10,"there is no word to explain my gratitude to the directors and george martin for not messing with the main story in the books and adapting the show right as it should be, no like the mokery named ""legend of the seeker"".for newcomers, this show is unlike what you normally see on tv, much as the books are. everything is so real and every decision and turn of events is like what could've happen if this story was in the real world.every episode is a great feast for the eyes and must be seen if you are a fan of fantasy series."
2021-07-25,wasimpubg,Forget about season1 and2 and8. I am sure you will love it.,7,first season is just a full of character introduction and their informations. second season is just the death of characters. and season8 is completely failure. rest of the season is worth watching.
2021-01-22,majhitanay,Best international series in the world,6,i think it's it's graphics and stories and thriller so strong and amazing not able to review this series this series is legendary
2021-06-29,nathanly,Just Me,10,"didn't like it at all, but you probably would. just not my cup of tea."
2021-08-03,thejdrage,What's with waiting 2 fricking years for the final season,10,"and then it was only 6 episodes , mostly of fighting. that's why i gave it an 8 when it might have otherwise gotten a 10. the first seasons were 10s! the last one - meh."
2021-05-24,s6f,"The ending isn't that bad imo, Is it good tho? No.",10,"this series is fun to watch, the acting is great, the story is mostly great, the timeline is so slow tho, everything is so slow here, but it was acceptable, the ending tho... the ending isn't that bad like other people say it is, it was the only reasonable choice, yes they could made it a whole better, but its not that bad.8.6/10."
2019-04-18,sbsammy2003,Sensational,10,"very intricate plot devised brilliantly, it starts off with a very rich backstory and continues from there. very accurately titled as everyone in this show wants the iron throne.a lot of blood spills and even more sex happens, this show is not for the faint of heart. brilliant acting from the cast, highlight to peter dinklage.don't get too attached to any one character as it sets a record for killing them off just when you think they're safe.debates and theories take up the majority of the fans group chats, it's a show to get obsessed about."
2018-12-14,solomonp810,Character development is unmatched.,10,"the best characters in the show (not my favorite) are by far are ramsay & joffrey and here's why.it doesn't take a lot to dislike a character or want to see them die off off of a show. but to actually feel like you want someone to die so bad and then when it happens to be overcome with joy, relief, and gratitude all at once, is truly remarkable.these types of feeling will get you all throughout the show with the characters. well done."
2011-06-29,invister123,Sean Bean's best work so far,6,"well, i could not watch the series along with my family, but the whole series is just amazing. the setup, the script, the actors were absolutely perfect.i was a little low,optimistic at the start of the series, but as it went on with the kind of blood, violence and nudity, it kept impressing me.i'd watched every episode with my favorite snacks and a can of pepsi. according to me, this series is a must watch for those who love fictional drama.i was planning on reading the book series but now i'd just wait for the new episodes and seasons for next seven years. thank you director and producer for making this series. all the best."
2018-10-15,greed1410,Better than book,9,book better than tv series? don't make me laugh.for a tv series this is 95/100. this 5 from 100 is because daenerys thread is mostly boring.book in its genre compared to malazans or the black company is 85/100.
2019-05-06,jjeliazkoff,I've never felt so conflicted...,1,"the first several seasons of the show were stellar. they didn't follow the books to the letter, but that's to be expected. they showed most of the glorious twists and turns of the books in a glorious way and they made fantasy mainstream again.however, midway through, the writing started to falter. cracks in the minds behind the screen started to become apparent. and in seasons 7 & 8, everything went downhill. story lines were left hanging, main characters were ignored, important twists and plot,points were replaced with cheap jump-scares and obvious pseudo-twists. the moment d&d went off the books, their inability to write even a basic story-line became apparent...at this point i'd recommend the tv show to people only for the cultural value of knowing how bad it can get... i honestly believe that 50 years from now this show will be studied in college (if those still exist) as an example of bad tv writing... i only hope that george r. r. martin manages to finish the books so that we finally get the end we've been waiting for..."
2019-05-29,moviexreds,Ending almost ruined it,10,"what a show. arguably the best ever made. unfortunately the writers thought they didn't have anything else to gain from it so they gave us what was probably the worst ending in tv history.
contrary to popular opinion, i actually enjoyed season 8. but the last episode is simply appalling.
what a shame.
but it still was a great show."
2014-06-15,skimmel666-734-2495,"Last Episode Season 4, 6/15/2014",10,"wow. just... wow. the only thing i knew for sure (spoiler alert!!) was that tyrion would not die, and jamie would be the one who saved him. and, when tyrion killed shea in the 'hand's bedroom, i said to the hubs, ""where's tywinn? taking a sh*t?"" ha ha!! i am oh so pleased with this final episode of this season, and i cannot wait to find out precisely how cirsei will react in the morning to find daddy dead, and precisely what the little man taking care of mountain (damned sob didn't die??? that ticked me off) means by, if he survives, ""he might not be the same."" what, he'll don a tutu and do ""swan lake""?? and that lord varys... alas, the thing that did break my heart was dany having to put her babies in chains. she will probably have to kill the remaining free baby. such is life when one wants to be queen, yet have no slaves. doesn't work. i loved it, all, regardless."
2021-07-10,crbrown25,Perfection,5,"game of thrones is a 70 hour long film that can only be described as excellence. everything about this movie is amazing. the characters, the acting, the story, the wardrobe, the choreography, the special effects, the humor, the nudity, the dialogue, and everything else. i don't see how it can get better than this."
2019-05-20,djxtreme78,Beyond Disgusted,9,i literally am just absolutely disgusted in this last season . anger and disappointment and feeling of total bewilderment touched with a undertone of underwhelmed . worst ending in the history of television . the producers and writers should hang their heads in utter shame ! i hope you never get hired to do anything again . you're pathetic
2019-05-02,njroertgen,Perfect Series destroyed by S8. So heartbreaking.,5,got was my absolute favorite show ever and up until s8 i considered this show to be nearly perfect. it was the best viewing experience of anything i'd ever seen in my life. that was until s8 completely destroyed the entire series. s8 ignores all 7 previous seasons of material and destroys everything the show has been building up to for 10 years. it is so heartbreaking that i am now in a depression. i used to recommend this show to everyone i know and now i can't anymore. the payoff just isn't worth watching. there is no point of watching the 65+ episodes of brilliance to get to the disastrous final season and be heartbroken. the most important episode...the apex of the whole series...the one episode the entire show has been building up to for 10 years was absolutely terrible. so unbelievably disappointing.
2019-01-18,devastation96,I love it,7,the best tv series ever created i also read the book.
2012-01-05,vincent_comeau,The best and most well-balanced series i have ever seen!,9,"i must say that i've watched the complete first season in one day,and i wish there was more, because frankly, this has to be one of the strongest series out there. there isn't one character that i find boring, i care for every character and the story is built in a very slow way that is just amazing, giving you small bits by bits but in a way that is so well done that you are gonna be craving for more. amongst all the character, i would have to say that arya arke and daenerys targaryen are my favorite characters, since they are two symbols of powerful and strong women who are slowly climbing to their true potential. arya being a tomboy skilled with weapons and daenerys carrying dragon's blood.although it is a very well scripted and played out show, it is not for the faint of heart or depressive people, it is very grim, and at times hard to bear, but i find that in a sense it gives me hope that our race has made progress trough the year and that even if it is a ''fictional'' show, i imagine it is very resembling to medieval age. therefore is why it fills me with relief to see that our time are much easier to live in, and it shows me that our situation is not bad at all, and that we have everything given to us. this show is very humbling in a way. there is also a lot of nudity and blood in the show so beware.for those that make comment saying that it is too violent and there is too much nudity, i would reply : we were born creatures of sexuality, and we will die so. we are born naked and are taught to be ashamed of our bodies. i think this show brings us back to the base, the sexuality is shown in a very smart and useful way. as for the blood, well it is a show about war and hard times , surely you'd be stupid not to expect a lot of it. got a problem with it? then don't watch it.if you are wanting lord of the ring, this show is not gonna give it to you, it is a very realistic show with some few supernatural elements, there aren't mages with rods and hordes of orcs, so beware! anyways, a very amazing and beautiful show in every way."
2015-05-11,lojack84,Season 5: Hugely disappointing.,10,"up until recently i was a big fan of hbo's adaptation of grrm's a song of ice and fire, there were minor changes in season four and some very dodgy pieces of dialogue written by the show runners but it now seems they were just testing the waters for something much worse.i understand that the books themselves have a lot of detail, too much to properly translate onto the screen but the show seems to have gone wildly off the rails, cutting characters and sticking characters where they shouldn't be and throwing out their story arcs. it's all just so two dimensional and boring now, the world doesn't seem to have any depth and the dialogue is absolutely terrible, more to the point events that hold a huge amount of weight (ramsay, reek and fake sansa) have been removed making one of the cruelest characters in the books seem completely benign.boring, i have dropped my score from 9 to 5, it would be lower if i hadn't enjoyed the previous seasons."
2019-05-20,piixie88,Great show ruined by last season,7,"this show required you to pay close attention at first because there are so many characters but it was worth it. great storylines, acting, beautiful cinematography, you name it. all that greatness came crumbling down just like a tower of jenga. seasons 1,6 were great. season 7 was the beginning of the deterioration but was still a tad palatable. season 8? i think just canceling the show and leaving it at a cliffhanger wouldve been an easier pill to swallow than what we got."
2020-11-12,cjlove2523,So many unanswered questions...,9,"with so many unanswered questions (what did the whitwalkers actually want?) what was their main goal? and why? what was the point of having all this leading up and buildup to jon snow being lyana stark and rhagar targaryen's true born male heir and not ned's ""illegitimate son"" what was the point to all that? just so he can be thrown back to the night's watch where he began? as if the man accomplished nothing? what in the seven hells happened to jamie lannister's character's arc? he went right back to where he started as well. dany's ""mad queen"" events happened way too fast after she did way too much good for way too many people. i was left so sad and dissatisfied after it was over. i felt like i wasted so much time and energy into something so grand that never paid off for me. such wonderful actors, beautiful sceneries, amazing music... overthrown by horrible writing, no payoff, and a very poor lit last season. also.. the killing of varys left such a bad taste in my mouth, that after that i didn't care who ended up on the bloody throne. i cannot say i give the overall season a 1 but it was so disappointing that i cannot even recommend the show to anyone now. unless i say ""brave yourself for a pitiful ending"" and that is just sad"
2019-04-29,f-aloisi,Episode 3 is outstanding,5,"1,5 hours, most of which of incredible battle images and shot in the dark. exhausting! terrifying! warriors and zombies. twd looks like a children series in comparison."
2021-06-24,imdb-179-789200,"Overrated, can see this being outdated already",10,"i'm quite surprised with the hype around this tv series. underneath this historical / fantasy optics, paired with sensationalist portrayals like violence and sexualisation, there's not a lot of substance or consistency to the overall story. just like the books.i didn't see any reason for the rape and sadistic scenes to add any realism when it's clear this is fantasy, there's dragons in it for crying out loud. if you like that kind of horror fantasy, maybe it's your thing.i don't think the quality of the visuals was very good either, it's filmed like those low budget history documentary reenactments, and you can tell the actors are wearing wigs etc.some scenes dragged with the dialogues and i barely felt anything for the characters including the starks. the various arcs of characters wasn't written with a complex or grand design, more like a soap opera of characters and groups coming and going.i barely made it to season 5. i'm not surprised to hear fans disappointed with season 8, i hardly saw any clever plots to hold the story together in the first place.this really is for shock scenes and soap opera type entertainment, sprinkled with a bit of fantasy motif on the side. i don't know how well this will stand the test of time, if anything it could be something to watch just for laughs."
2017-07-13,krishu-78199,Masterpiece!!,10,i don't know here to start i think this should be on top with at least 9.7 ratings. the glorious era of westerous when almost all house were living happily then there happens a accident which transforms the history of westerous and then there is danyreous seeking revenge of her father. music:10/10 journey/story:9/10 character development:10/10
2019-05-22,hamadbinjaber,Disappointing....,10,the final season ruined all the build up.... i do not recommend for a new viewer to watch this show.
2019-05-16,recycledmediaz,THE BEST EVER,9,hands down. and despite what all the whiners who aren't getting their way are saying...season 8 has been the best so far!
2019-08-03,mmoo7,"Daenerys Targaryen, the only queen of seven kindoms or nothing!!!",9,"i am here for the daenerys targaryen. she died in vain. she died for nothing. after seeing 73 episodes within 2 weeks, i felt wasted. she was the true savior of the seven kingdoms and killed by a coward. sacrificed two of her beloved dragons (death of them were devastating), half her unsullied soldiers, missandei.. there were no possible reasons to make her mindless at the end of the season. and still, she could be a great ruler, even though her massacre at the king's landing. cersei lannister or 'the ultimate cu*t', was the only person who deserved a death like that, killed by a loved one. every one hated dany, sansa, arya, jon, tyrion, the northerners... those who got their breath only because of the true queen.i still wonder that, the person with the devil's hand, cersei, died like a normal person irrespective of her deeds. and even tyrion sympathizes for her death at last, who killed his father. also, tywin lannister was a far better person than cersei. everyone took the power of daenerys's as an advantage, conquer places and backstabbed her.i expected a one and only ending like every other viewers: - she as the queen of seven kingdoms, tyrion- hand of the queen, jon- the king of north, samwell- the grand maester, and use other trustworthy lords in the small council. under what circumstances, daenerys will always be the queen in got for me😒. that is how it should have ended. jon and tyrion are the exact kingslayers. 😡😡😡 i hate got..."
2016-02-25,hcib,Breathtaking,10,"the story line, even if it progresses slowly, it does not become boring at all. in every episode, there will be an event you could not have ever guessed, while every episode finishes in a point where you want to see the other one asap! the plot is definitely exciting and meticulously planned so as not to leave any gaps, but still putting you in the position of googling more about the characters' backgrounds to understand the mindset of them, as well as try to predict their next moves.my favorite character is john snow and i cannot wait to see what happened with him. seems that the author j.r.martin is willing to kill everyone until the end of the show. having seen all the seasons, some of them in a single day (!), i am a big fan of game of thrones, even without having read the books."
2019-05-04,mohammadgaber-86128,Lena heady,8,lena heady is the worst actress i haver ever seen in my life
2019-05-21,ammsh,The greatest in history.,10,the greatest series possible to see in your life and in hollywood great work directed and produced and his book and shocks all great. you should watch this series more than twice in order to accommodate the great work and all its details.
2019-05-26,azookingooz,Best show EVER!,5,game of thrones is the best show that ever existed even though the last two seasons were absolutely trash and disappointing that doesn't mean it deserves any rating less that 10.
2017-09-13,diazsachi,Mind blowingly awesome I wish I could give more than 10 stars.,6,"game of thrones is one of those tv shows which i swear will still be considered a pinnacle of television entertainment 50 years from now. and we will tell our grand kids of the sweet torture we undergo every year for a decade waiting for a season of got to start.* great acting, good plot, amazing cgi,beautifully choreographed battle scenes,picturesque sets from all over the world, carefully detailed costumes and crazy plot twists. what more can you ask for?"
2018-12-28,springnietvoordetrein,Very good show,10,one of the few that i want to keep watching. even when you need to wait fooooooooor evveeerr to see when the winter is coming.no really great show. good acting. everything fits. first session could be less ... well when you see the session you will know what i mean.
2019-05-18,xbo_ly_qx,GOAT,9,greatest of all time ☝🏻no tv show could beat game of thrones
2019-05-20,xbo_ly_qx,GOAT,10,this is the greatest show of all time even if the end wasn't that good but still a great show
2017-07-19,krakatau-48313,Absolutely unattainable,1,"i will only say that such productions can mean the end of the cinema ... end, because i'm sure no one, but no one will do and never, but will never be made better than him. i cannot find comparisons and epithets to describe his quality. and to make it clear i will say that on my 10,point rating system i appreciate this movie - 100, or 1000, or infinity. absolute,unspeakable and unconditional masterpiece !!!!!!!!!!!"
2020-10-15,robertamanuela,The final episode fits perfectly for this masterpiece,1,"i just do not understand why so many people are so disappointed of the final season, and especially of the last episode. they are all influenced by the romantic comedies' happy,endings of our times. but the games of thrones is not that kind of movie, from the beginning to the end. it is a deep political odyssey of the human nature. the end is a happy ending for the entire world, and not for a particular human. i was awed by the in-depth political and philosophical understanding of the author when i watched the final episode. it was the perfect happy ending. but for a greater purpose. jon snow, from the beginning till the end, was the purest soul, the one who loved justice and the other's well more than himself. i kept myself far for spoiling readings before i watched, and thus the end was a real surprise for me. i am so happy with the happy-ending which george martin chose it. i applauded. literally. please, get your mind out of the box when watching or re-watching this movie, and you will see an authentic masterpiece."
2020-10-23,robertamanuela,The film is perfect and the final episode as well,10,"i must reiterate my review without spoiling alert, because recently i read thomas brodie's declaration that he did meet anyone who loves the last episode of the series. it is the best tv series and maybe the best movies of all times. the final episode, as the entire movie, is a political allegory. it is not a romantic comedy. those who criticize the final episode, i dare say, they did not get the idea of the film. the end perfectly fits wit the entire movie. it is a happy ending. maybe not how you expect it to be. but it is a happy ending."

2019-05-14,daemonxhun,Meme of Thrones,7,"this series had the potential to become something truly great by the end and open a new chapter in the world of television. sadly, the eighth season completely ruined the whole series, including its characters, its world and its story.i won't mention any spoilers here, but if you really want to watch this series, be prepared for a gigantic disappointment at the journey's end. you'll watch one of the greatest series burn down in huge flames.if i have to rate each seasons individually, here's how i would rank them:season 1,4: these are definitely the most complex, most layered seasons with the highest level of scriptwriting. excellent dialogues, pacing, character developments, narrative twists, etc. mainly because at this time the writer of the books was still involved in the making of the series and the series were heavily build upon the books. the absolute best is season 4 because it had the best character interactions and story arcs and it also had some of the most memorable moments in the series.season 5 is a mixed bag. it has the heavily disliked dorne plotline and overall, most episodes in it while are okay, they don't move the story forward in any meaningful way, they often just feel like fillers. but at the same time, the last four episodes are extremely good and interesting, mainly hardhome, which is arguably one of the best episodes in the series (and also my personal favourite along with the ninth episode of the sixth season).season 6 is fantastic and in some ways, it's maybe the best along with season 4. but it's hard to properly judge it, because despite some of its darker moments, it feels rather optimistic and uplifting, and maybe because of it, for some people, it won't really feel like game of thrones. but everything that happens in this season happens for a reason and everything is earned, twists and moments don't feel cheap or forced, they feel natural, there are no filler episodes and the overall pacing is great.season 7 is a mixed bag, similarly to season 5. one half of it is great, the other half is not so much. but as opposed to season 5, in this case, the first half (first three episodes) are the good ones, and the later episodes are the bad ones. the first three episodes are very dialogue-heavy and character-centric and they feel very well written and satisfying, they feel a natural continuation of the story and quality of season 6. but after that, the logic gets completely thrown out of the window, everything starts to happen so fast and basically, game of thrones' real downfall starts from here.season 8 is a monumental disappointment. it subverts your expectations in the worst possible ways, things happen purely for shock value instead of happening because of the natural progression of the story. character arcs get thrown completely out of the window, there are tons of deus ex machina moments, main characters wear plot armor and they are practically invincible. things happen way too fast therefore there isn't enough time to really build up certain scenes in an intelligent and beleivable manner and scenes that are supposed evoke a certain feeling from the viewers (for example, sadness) evoke a totally different feeling instead (they make the viewers laugh). there are a lot of forced and artificial drama, the episodes are extremely inconsistent in a lot of ways, not just compared to the previous' seasons episodes, but compared only to other season 8 episodes too. the biggest victim of season 8 is game of thrones itself."
2019-05-20,dieinblackhole,The last season flushes down every good aspects of Game of Thrones,10,"it really pains me to give such a beautifully well crafted show a single star because how idiotically absurd it got at the end.a show which touted itself to be a game changer in the way stories are told fell to very same clichéd tried and used methods of storytelling that sometimes got even worse.plot armors, dumb dialogues, senseless storylines...it had everything that the first four seasons never needed to have for furthering the plot.game of thrones was always a character driven show which made it shine among the others but somewhere along s5 to s7 it started to become plot driven show where characters started to act in stupid ways which otherwise they wouldn't to further the plot.s8 was the final nail in the coffin where the main characters were either sidelined, killed or dumbed down just for the sake of coming to the conclusion.all the hours invested in watching and discussing the show now just feels like a waste of time and energy. a show known for its betrayals in the end betrayed its own fans"

2019-10-26,cmgolde,A fallen Angel,10,"got will go down in tv history as one of the best examples of how to make a good tv series, and how not to make a good tv series. the writers really ruined this show, they forgot why we loved season 1,4 and messed with the formula. it wasn't major character deaths and epic fight scenes that excited us, it was that major characters couldn't avoid the logical endings brought upon by their decisions. it was the great dialogue, story, and characters that made this show so great.in the good days of got the saying ""you would reap what sow"" really held true. if you messed up then you suffered the consequences, there was no ""but they're main characters so they'll be ok"". seasons 5-8 ignored that, major deaths were being done for the shock factor, not because this was what was bound to happened based off of previous events. season 7 and 8 were messy, confusing, and devoid of logic. hell, the last 20 minutes or so of the last episode played out like an snl skit. the writers got bigger deals and like a kid who realized they could keep the grade they wanted in a class didn't give a damn about the ending.seasons 1-4 were some of the best television that i've ever watched. seasons 5-6 were still great but beginning to show some serious issues. season 7 left me confused and annoued. season 8 made me angry and wishing i'd never watched those last few episodes."
2020-04-26,zahamako,It all leads to nothing,10,"the first seven seasons were masterpieces and i even considered this to be one of my favorite tv shows. until season 8 released...
they were so close. they nearly made a near,perfect tv show but we then learned that without george rr martin's source material, d&d are quite possibly the worst writers in entertainment history and they destroyed the whole series with just 6 episodes.
one king to rule them all
6 episodes to destroy the show
it has no rewatch value anymore. they could have pulled off a masterpiece of a final season but they crammed and rushed everything in seven and a half awful hours. it's like grabbing any of the three star wars trilogies and morphing it into one 2 hour movie, it can't be done. they had the biggest show in the world, which if they wanted too, they could have had more episodes and seasons. but they didn't. i don't know how they thought they could cram everything in just under 8 hours but they failed. what were they thinking? they shattered seven seasons of buildup in a matter of minutes.
don't even get me started on the set mistakes and logic of this season. the coffee cup on daenerys' table. fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. the water bottles in the final episode. it just proves how lazy and fast they rushed filming and didn't worry about the set at all. dumbasses.
there's no point watching this show today if you've never seen it. it leads to nothing. nothing at all. the worst ending in television history."

2019-04-29,maelmathieu,"Disgraceful, disappointing",1,"seasons 1,6 are 10/10 season 7 is 8/10season 8 is -10/10. seriously. this season is not only botched, it ruins retroactively the other seasons. i used to re-watch some episodes before, now that i've seen season 8 i lost any taste for got.i highly recommend not watching season 8 if you never did. please don't. keep the magic, keep the good memories intact, this is like watching your best friend getting killed and having flashacks every time you see a picture of him.
trust me, never watch season 8. it's not worth it."

2019-05-16,traianrotariu,Never seen a more realistic fantasy series!,8,"every time i read or watch a fantasy story, i expect to see absolute heroes and and absolute villains, more exactly tipical characters with poor psychological development. about got i can only say you'll see the most realistic characters in a fantasy story. there is no main character which makes the plot even more exciting and surprising. the numerous twist will make you stand on the edge of your seat in many moments. the graphics and the music are fantastic as well. my only complaint about is about the last 3 episodes of season 8 where the plot was uselessly rushed which reflected in a significant loss regarding to characters arcs. maybe producing 10 episodes to the final season would have offered the producers the chance to develop the twists much better than they've done. my favorite tv series anyways.ps: i'd have rated it 9.5, but i don't have that opinion."
2019-09-30,rob_bruin,Brilliant till season 8; that season was rubbish,10,"for years i watched in awe and excitement, couldn't stop watching, always curious when the next season came out.but season 8 let me down so hard! two years for everything to make it perfect, and the only thing one gets is rushed themes, with many special effects and many action, and and no character,diving as an effect. it's like the story and the characters played second violin. it almost always reminded me of the film ""300"".this could've been a whole lot better.however, up until season 8, it was brilliant. great acting, everything in balance. but season 8 made me so disappointed, that i can't give it more than a 5 out of 10. sure, the story of season 8 can/could be the same. but the makers should've taken more time and episodes to conclude it all. they didn't. two years waiting for nothing. shame on them, because that makes the early 7 seasons feel like a waste of time watching, i'm sorry to say. :-("
2019-11-11,bassicallybob,"Stunning, immersive, daring and tear jerking",9,"everything you could ever want in a fantasy is here, i cannot possibly list all the stunning characteristics of this series.took a hit at season 7, but wasn't horrible.i'd give season 8 ,100/10 if i could. i don't even count that as got"
2021-08-30,constelaciondelyra,"Amazing start, horrible ending. Watch with that in mind.",7,"i can understand why people are giving got such high ratings. but i cannnot give it more than a 5 considering the whole 8 seasons. the first 4 seasons, maybe 5, where amazing. then it started going down, although until season 7 i would have accepted it as a minor flaw. but season 8 ruined everything for me: characters that we had follow and rooted for during several years where absolutely unrecognizable, not them anymore. one thing is to change a character into a villain/mental patient, etc...and a different thing is to dispossess them of their more basic traits. plus the plot sucked big time, the little plot that was presented. the result was a disappointment so huge i want to forget i lost so much time watching this. i will never rewatch it or watch any of the spin,offs. this is a warning of what you can expect: do not get too invested in this show or in the end you'll be demanding to get back the precious time that you wasted on this."
2020-02-16,vincinnum,So sad.. they ended the show mid-season. Wish they had a 8th season as well.,9,"the show has a total of 7 seasons. good show. highly recommend. the only downside is that they didn't renew the show for the 8th season and ended it mid,way. there is a fan-made 8th season by two teenage kids d&d, but that's just terrible - not worth your time.go ahead and watch action packed 7 seasons of an epic saga.valar morghulis"

bad directing
from there down it's an excellent show"
2021-04-02,aronmartinvisser,Winter is coming...,1,"review s1,s6 or why you should start watching the series.i've just finished season 6. not sure if i want to keep going because of the negative reviews on 7 and 8. but let me tell you about what i've seen. it's so great. the acting, the cinematography, its all top notch. and the storyline is really good. most seasons it's just really great episodes with here and there an outstanding, magnificent episode. sometimes even two or three in a row. these 6 seasons are a must-watch for anyone with ears and eyes.edit: season 7 was really good either. season 8 was a huge disappointment with loads of plotholes."
2020-11-09,zaro-65774,The ending ruined it for me! Makes no sense at all!,7,"one of the main things that make no sense in the last season is tyrion's defence! after a long honourable conversation with jon about duty and how he believes jon will rule well he doesn't even mention jon at his defence speech!! i find that bizarre! also, sam was sitting there too and he didn't mention even a single good word about his long time ""only best friend he ever had""! arya didnt mention her brother and didn't defend him at all despite in earlier episodes been shown to advise jon and how she believes him to be the king in the north! jamie and cersei end was also rushed and not as deep as their relationship and their family's obsession with legacy!how did the writers ignore all these details!!there are more and more missing links and failures in the final seasons but these in particular are just nonsense!"

2014-04-11,malka770,Great story but I don't feel like seeing a porno,10,"i love epic stories set in medieval times. this series definitely has qualities of a great story, original and creative yet not too much where its not realistic. knights, dragons, princesses, kingdoms, wars,drama this series has it all. the only issue i have with it is the soft porn aspect..its way too much. i am a girl and i guess there are men who beg to differ on my view. not everyone wants to see two people getting it on or peoples private parts; there are websites and movies for that i don't need it rubbed in my face. there is a way to convey the message without overly elaborating it like the show does.everyone who has a brain and a history book knows that incest, rape, brothels and indecency was rampant back then no need to amplify it in every other scene.i find tv shows now a days exploit sexuality way too much and its a shame because this show has great potential. i would have given it a 9 or a 10 because the acting,scenery, story line is superbe...too bad"
2020-10-26,huizingaevan,Greatest tv show I've ever seen,8,"honestly i don't really get most of the complaints in season 8. i'd say my least favorite season was season 2 personally but i loved every season. season 8 is no doubt a bottom 3 season for pretty much everyone but like i said i love all the seasons. best seasons were 4,1,6 best episode was winds of winter. i just love this show and i'm rewatching it again already. after i i finished breaking bad i didn't really feel the need to rewatch the whole show despite being shorter. game of thrones was a journey. one i feel will never ever be topped. i know it's hard to compare a drug drama to a fantasy show with probably 30x the amount of characters but that's the easiest way to compare. the only complaint i can really think of is the fact they didn't show jon telling his sisters his true identity. and how the (bad worded) over jaime lannister. does it make sense that he would go back to cersei? yes i see this as pretty realistic seeing as jaime as a person is very dependent on cersei for pretty much 7 seasons his main intentions involve cersei. does it make it less infuriating that he died in such a way? not really. he had one of the best arcs in the show just for him to go back after having sex with brienne. if ur gonna go back to cersei why you gotta (offensive name for sexual intercourse) her bro. it just feels like his whole intention in the last 3 episodes was to make the audience feel bad for cersei when she ends up dying. which i would say they succeeded honestly i just which they didn't flush jaimes last episode or two on the show down the toilet. there were other ways of doing such a thing. she could've died after giving birth or something and then the building could still tumble on her giving off the same effect. aside from that it's a perfect show and i still see the show as flawless in my eyes even thought technically it isn't. just watch the show dude."
2020-07-25,fantasybestgenre,Still the best,9,"seasons 1,7 are worth watching and re-watching. seasons 1-4 are masterpieces. seasons 5-6 has episodes with the most amazing battle sequences for television. season 7 has high production value and amazing dragon special effects and battle action.watch youtube videos or read articles on what happens in season 8, but don't bother watching the episodes that were aired by hbo in april-may 2019, because the story is best left to your own imagination. as far as i am concerned, hbo's season 8 does not exist."
2021-04-05,wcrawford-07339,Best series of all time,10,"hands down best series of all time.the most epic of theme songs with the intro music, it was my ring tone for years, never get sick of it.the last season copped it from fans but i thought it was well done. i loved the battle against the dead when all the fire sticks got put out. the suspense! a few things didn't make sense but i still loved it. however the last episode i was devastated with what dani did to everyone. cerci deserved a graphic fiery death in her tower all alone from dani saying 'dracarys' riding past on her dragon. i was so shattered with the ending i wanted more of a happy ending with jon snow as king and to be with dani, and for them not to be related , roll eyes, and then to find more dragon eggs! and sort of live happy every after. but of course it's got so it's harsh and brutal how it ended which was fitting after more thought. but still!! i was so sad when it ended i so wanted the love story to continue for jon snow. i could write heaps about the series but all in all best series of all time."
2021-04-05,sggoducks,What a letdown,1,"this show is still one of the greatest shows ever made. seasons 1,6 were outstanding while season 7 took a little dip. the problem i have like many others is season 8. season 8 had so much potential with all of the build up from seasons 1-7. the writing in season 8 was disastrous. yes, episode 6 was the worst ending in history of endings but it goes beyond that."
2011-06-13,lomax82003,No happy ending,10,"i didn't read the books so what i see in the episode this week is completely new to me. the movie is outstanding, the plot it very complex, you get a lot of action/drama scenes. sometimes it gives you the felling that you're watching a football match where you don't have a favorite team, but as the game goes you get this occurred felling and you get yourself backing a team as if they where your favorites from the beginning. it definitely makes you want more. i was going like this episode after episode until i've reached this 9 cursed number were lord eddard stark dies. how is it that the main character, the iconic figure of this series, the one that absorbed like a sponge the hole action around him dies? you see him on the trailers, on the advertisements, on the press posters, you see him everywhere. every morning i see his face on a big poster in the bus station. he made the film alive! why would you kill the man that puts people in front of the tv? i understand that this is from the book and he was suppose to die. ok, i agree with this but the book foreshore did not point out ned as the movie does. i understand that not all movies should have a happy ending and that normally it should made the acting more trilling and the audience more attracted when some important character dies but the hole team blew it when they put ned on a pedestal and then hacked him down like a lamb."
2021-08-30,jacobday-68547,In its prime the best series ever,6,"season 1,2,3,4,6 are amazing. unpredictable, yet satisfying. despite the atrocities in season 8 it's definitely worth the watch just to experience it's prime."
2014-06-02,artis-spertals,Probably the best TV show in the new millennium so far,5,"the story itself is something special , similar with harry potter and lord of the rings - it takes the audience in a different world. the story is well written and makes emotions - mostly those emotions that you want to become a part of that world, you want to experience the fights, you want to see dragons in life. so the tv show, what is based on such good story, doesn't need that much - just not ruin the story. and this show does that. the cast is good, the bad thing is that there are some actors changing for the same roles - i don't know why they are doing that, but as a huge tv show, you should evade that by any means. that is making the viewer disconnect from the story. anyway - the cast is good, the story is unpredictable (if you haven't red the books), everything seems as real as possible - real emotions, real fights, real dirty bastards doing faul things - no sugarcoating.for those, who are rating this as a less than 7 - you should be banned from watching anything ever again, because you don't understand anything about tv/movies. if you rate this as a 1, you should be removed from this earth, because it proves that you have no logical sense and you are a probable mass murderer :)"
2011-04-28,bernierb,Fantastic a must see,10,"i know about the books but i never read the story.it is nice to see that a series looks so great. i did not want to spoil myself with reading the story since i bought the book but kept away from it.the cast is awesome, the settings are great, the plot is very mature and well done. only thing i am afraid is that material is gonna be compressed because of time constraints, but perhaps i will be wrong.i hope much more success than actual viewer ship right now but i am sure this series will achieve a cult status down the road with more fans discovering this each day when the series is done when it is done! cheers it was worth the wait!"
2016-07-17,lawrencejosesinclair,Boring beyond belief,10,"most boring major show ever ,- i gave up during season two -- nothing was happening, and the entire story is just like a bloodthirsty medieval royal family, france to be exact, where he got the idea, from series of historical french novels taking place in the 13th century.. the only thing making it ""modern"" or a fantasy is apparently a dragon, which never appeared while i watched.. then a friend said that big wall in the wilderness was to keep out zombies? unreal - how trivial, and unimaginative.. when you want vapid fans to flock to see it, add vampires or zombies or both.. lowest common denominator stuff, just made with big money... i don't have a decade to spare to wait for this to unfold more violence and greed, that's been done so often that there's nothing illuminating or cathartic in it for me, but apparently it's new to people who are probably new to life itself, like those under 30..my hope is that before finishing the book series or the tv show, george martin will suddenly die, that would be appropriate.. his sf writing is much better to me, like sandkings.. check it out..i give it five on production values alone, and peter dinklage's acting, but he's better in the station agent"
2020-05-27,chillibec78,So close to being amazing & rewatchable - let down by an unworthy ending,10,"after 2,3 seasons of hearing how good this show was, i decided to wait until i could binge watch it all. i started it 8 days ago & it didn't disappoint, i was totally gripped, staying up until 4am some nights!
was so excited to watch the final season yesterday but found myself disappointed. it felt rushed and silly at times.i wasn't expecting a fairytale ending, that's not got, but a lot of events seemed inconsistent with the characters we've been following. maybe if it weren't so rushed, some storylines may have made more sense, such as daenerys burning all the people she'd been trying to save, even after hearing bells of surrender. love is blind but it seemed they'd given john snow a personality transplant when he still backed her after that.bran was not bran anymore, as he kept informing people, he was now the 3 eyed raven, yet he became king bran. the night king wanted to kill him, thereby killing the memories and history of the living, so he's pretty vital, yet they elect him as king, a position of high risk of assassination?! it makes no sense. not to mention the fact, bran/3 eyed raven is emotionless and lacks any sort of passion, hardly good traits for a leader and he said he now lives mostly in the past. it was shocking he was made king but in a silly laughable way.it seemed like they were trying for shocks and going against expectations, probably imagining the social chatter afterwards etc, but to the detriment of the integrity of the show and it often went against the character and story arcs of the previous 7 seasons. i kept wondering if it was written by totally different people who hadn't watched the previous seasons.a little thing along the same theme, one of my favourite things were the scenes and growing bond between jamie lannister and lady brian. it was understandable jamie wanted to return to his sister in the end, but the way they handled him leaving seemed wrong and unnecessarily cold.i have some questions too, would john really have been punished? technically he killed an invading self proclaimed queen who had not been sworn it, plus she had chosen to burn about 1 million people after hearing bells of surrender. also he was the heir, not daenerys, why was he not more important than daenerys after those facts were learned?it had the feeling of being rushed which probably didn't help. the greatness of this show warranted a true and well considered ending, why they had to cram it in to so few episodes is a mystery and a disappointment.
i was getting excited at the thought of rewatching this again soon, right up until the last couple of episodes but that won't be the case after the ending unfortunately. maybe i will, but i would stop after the great war with the dead at winterfell.
if i'd seen or heard how bad the ending was i would not have watched this show, i do feel slightly cheated. i won't be recommending it, which is a shame considering 95% of it was brilliant, but the ending is just as important, if not more so.it's never been done before but considering the insanely low score on imdb for the last 2 episodes, i really think it would be worth filming season 9 - the alternative ending. maybe continuing on from the great war. i think the investment would be worth it for its legacy and anyone buying box sets."
2019-03-17,arunk-613-852555,Wish I could score it higher than 10,8,"game of thrones challenges the viewers to watch and develop the taste to enjoy it for first 3,5 episodes. it is not because it is bad; it's just that most of us are used to watching shows and movies with linear story lines. you will truly enjoy it once you get the hang of the character names and their relation to one and another.the production quality with attention to details is amazing, similar to peter jackson's lotr. the dialogues, the acting especially by the child actors are commendable.the cgi improves as the season progresses due to better budget and technology. the first four seasons i would say are the best till now(season 7) when you look at only through the perspective of political gamesmanship.the show later on becomes more linear as story lines show signs of merging. season 5 and 6 have beautifully shot action sequences laced with incredible background score and decent story. ramdin djawadi is truly a musical genius.i would consider season 7 to be weakest of them all. make no mistake, it is still better than all other shows out there, but pales in comparison to the previous seasons. i disliked the fact that great conversation and dialogues that is an intricate part of got was missing in this season. you can't blame the show-runners as george rr martin who is the best in crafting them hasn't written the book yet.eagerly waiting for the season 8. from the trailers it seems to be filled with mammoth battles and fates of several characters will be decided."
2011-05-31,bprokosz,Excellent television adaptation from excellent books.,10,"first of all, i have only read the 1st book, ""game of thrones"" because i wanted to read after i saw the first few episodes of the series. first of all, putting a face to the characters is worth it. hbo and the actors have done an amazing job making every single person exact to how their character is in the book. dialog is, for the most part, word for word and it's pretty simple to divide the book into ten parts and read accordingly.overall its a fantastic fantasy series that most people will relate to lord of the rings, even though it really is nothing like it aside from it being grand,scale, having sean bean, and having funny sounding names for things.each episode is better than the one before it and even if you think the first few are a little slow, you'll relish them compared to the intense, often breathtaking pace the series jumps to during the latter half of episode 4.finally, its hbo...there will be nudity, swearing, and violence....of the 3 i will say the nudity is a tad overdone...while exposition is revealed during most of the scenes and is very important, it boarders on late-night cinemax, especially during episode 7.10/10, for story, acting, cinematography, and being faithful to the origin. even if you don't like lotr (i don't), its just fun to watch."
2011-06-07,bobpike,Fabulous!,2,"what a series! and the richness and depth of its characters! this gets my vote as one of the best tv series of all time. at the same time, i've been watching that drivel called ""camelot"" (no more, though) and this fantasy series is what good viewing is all about and deserves an award.having read the books, i know that the story has been streamlined for television and it has probably been criticised for that reason but the essence is still there. it would be a mammoth undertaking, but i can only hope the producers of the series continues with all the books ( there are four in print with one due out next month and two more forthcoming). keep up the good work, george!"
2019-05-20,vigorusvampire-vijay,It deserves 9 stars but giving 1 caz of season 8,7,this show doesn't deserve 9.5. a pathetic ending to a great series.. don't waste your time watching
2021-01-31,severozgur2000,Here is an alternate that would be loved by everyone,9,ill keep it simple:white walkers win the joint army being obliriated and scattered across westeros.another battle ensues in kings landingjon finds rhaegal in the north injuredwalkers are winning dani tells john to stab her with his valerian steel sword to save the realm.jon does after a final kiss and his sword becomes the lightbringer and he becomes azor ahaihe gathers all armies of westeros left and puts a final charge where he defeats night kingand becomes the king he was destined to bebut of course that would require another season and you guys were in a hurry to wrap it up and do a star wars movie...
2011-07-11,aliahash,Incredible,4,"it just doesn't get better than this.acting: check .. cinematography: check .. dialogue: check .. directing/screening: checkif you are not a fan of fantasy i urge you to watch this show as it will completely change your perception. this show is so true to the book its unreal at how they managed to capture each and every essence that the book emits. it takes a couple of episodes for one to be totally engrossed into it. i have a 6,episode rule with all shows however this show needed no more than 20 mins for you to know that it was going to be exceptionally good"
2011-04-30,guy-schellens-41-715308,Superb,9,"i never read the ""a song of ice and fire"" series, so maybe my unbiased opinion can be of use.from what i've seen from the tv show (2 episodes), i can assure you it's up to hbo's high standards.the fantasy elements are minimal in the first episodes, with only the chilling opener and some dragon eggs that seem not entirely dead ;) so what we now essentially have is a dark medieval tale. i'm wondering how they will roll out these elements in the next episodes.the atmosphere is extremely grim to american standards and the storyline will grab you by the throat from the very first scene.it has complex characters, all with their own agenda, which you just can't label ""good"" or ""evil"". they behave like normal people would. it is totally believable. no formulaic ""comic relief"" , no ""cute"" characters... how confusing this must be for some people :,) this is a series that doesn't threat its viewers as children and entirely lives up to the hype.an excellent job, hbo"
2012-12-20,seb-chovi-man,"Beautiful design, but...",1,"this is perhaps one of the best shows in tv, sponsored, obviously, by hbo. the movie,scale production is magnificent. from the smallest costume to the biggest set, it is entirely faithful to the books. the cast performances are, not only true to it's characters, but to the book design they have. i must say, however, that while season one was narrowly perfect, season two felt different. perhaps it is because season one was, without considering minor details, completely faithful to the first book, while important plot elements where altered from the second book in the tv adaptation. the show creators have previously stated that they are not adapting ""a game of thrones"", ""a clash of kings"" and the other three books as each, but rather as the whole series ""a song of ice and fire"" which gives them freedom to move scenes and important elements. yes, it gives them freedom to do so, but it does not give them freedom to change the story plot. they have also stated that character introduction is another reason for the changes. perhaps this one i can live with, for in the second book there are at least thirty new characters, ten at least very important. still, it's not impossible. look at boardwalk empire! it has more characters than i can think about right now, and although steve buscemi's nucky thompson is the central character, almost every other character has it's own history. no matter what they say, in the second season, small changes like the introduction meera and jojen reed where acceptable, but the changes made in the stories of theon and especially daenerys where just out of place. for theon's story, there is one key character which is only mentioned, and not even by name. i seriously hope that this character is introduced in the next season because not only theon's, but at least three other character's story is affected in the future by said character. daenerys story changes really made me suffer to watch season two. xaro xhoan daxos becoming king of qarth? daenerys'dragons kidnapped by pyat pree? and as in theon's story, at the end of daenerys story in the book there is at least one extremely important character who makes an appearance, yet in the adaptation, he was nowhere to be seen! this changes really made daenerys story impossible to watch. no matter how good your adaptation is, or how many viewers you have, you just don't pull out important characters! perhaps because i really loved the books is why i disliked so much this changes, but still, i hope they correct some of them in the next season, or, more precisely, i hope the creators stay truer to the books. ignoring all of that, this is a must-see for fantasy hard-core fans."
2011-09-05,pithyoneliner,TV at it's finest,6,"hbo raise the bar once again with this magnificent offering. undoubtedly the best tv show of 2011. from the inventive and beautifully executed opening sequence got will have you gripped and take you on a roller,coaster of intrigue, deception and treachery. all beautifully set and shot, and acted by an outstanding and well cast ensemble.got contains an excellent spread of heroes and villains, all of whom you will empathise with (apart from maybe catelyn who was a bit 'meh'). while the story has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout.one special mention of peter dinklage, in an extremely well acted series his performance towers above the rest. bravo sir, and not a bad english accent for a yank as well! it's a cliché, but if you are going to watch one serialisation of a widely loved series of fantasy novels this year: make it hbo's 'game of thrones'"
2017-06-09,mnunez786,"If you have never watched this series, you don't know what you're missing.",10,"visually stunning, amazingly plotted, well , adapted from the novels, beautifully performed...i mean, what is there not to love about this series? the sheer plot twists give this fantasy tale the gritty reality that ""the good guys do not always win."" indeed, in george r. r. martin's world, they often lose -- tragically. but hope always lives in those who survive and eventually the strands of alliances come together to forge a powerful force of societal change."
2019-05-20,ilija-malinovic,When two incompetent writers are given a massive budget and an extraordinary crew,10,"it is a fact that the writing has gone downhill in this show. it is a fact that the last couple of episodes and/or seasons were rushed and under,developed. it is a fact that the character development was thrown out of the window. it is a fact that d&d are solid adapters, but very lousy writers (fellowship of the wight storyline must be the stupidest thing i've ever seen on tv).it is also a fact that the casting was just perfect - as a book reader, i couldn't have wished for better actors; not just their resemblance and accuracy, but (most of) their acting was superb. it is also a fact that visuals are stunning - the locations were brilliantly selected, sets were magnificently built, costumes were beautifully chosen, special effects are amongst the best on tv at the moment (probably the best). it is also a fact that the score is otherworldly, i honestly don't have words to describe how perfect all of it is (kudos to ramin djawadi). it is also a fact that all of the directors did an amazing job, considering all the different dimensions and sets this show has (grand battles, silent dinners, feasts, war meetings, conquers, casual conversations...).it is not the best show ever. it is not a perfect show. but it certainly broke ground, it certainly set the standard high for the next great epic tv show and it certainly was (and will remain) a global phenomenon that should be remembered for all of its qualities."
2013-09-23,emmanuel-mg-87,One of the most stunning... or the most?,7,"perhaps i'm not being as objective as i could, even then this amazing series is one of the most stunning tv shows, don't know in the future, but right now its possible and probably the best tv series.got haven't point of comparison with other series like breaking bad, homeland, mad men, i'm sorry for those who like this series but they just not as good as got, don't matter what the emmy's says, i like to believe that we already know how the emmy's usually works for the benefit of just a few. talking about braking bad, or mad men that i also enjoy, are a really good tv shows but also are more popular, made with the objective of make more people to like it without being too risky or controversial, or mature, i know that got its some times harder to watch (for some people) because this series wasn't made for everyone, was made to be the best show, something like no other tv show, epic, savage, crude, and surprisingly real in the human behavior, of course attached to a fantasy story with dragons, magic, epic battles, and so many secrets to discover.i literally don't have all the correct adjectives or words to describe it (english is not my native language) and even if i loose some objectivity rating this a 10 over 10, the great work that all the people involved put in this series deserves no less than a 9 rate in a movie/series rater website, considering that if u give it a 9 that will mean that there is no other series capable to have the same rate.in all aspect, from technical, sound, video, editing, mixing, direction, cast, actresses and actors, story, plot, script... in every single aspect it's a flawless piece of work.just want to say thanks! to george r. r. martin for write this great story., and to emilia clarke just thank you for existing and being part of got.thank you to all of you in game of thrones."
2019-05-22,salmanqaiser,One of the best show (with a bit questionable plots in final 2-3 episodes),9,game of thrones has been a huge part of our lives and i want to say that i'm glad that i experienced it. the show brings so many emotions out of us. truly a masterpiece.
2019-05-22,salmanqaiser,Incredible Show (minus the last few episodes),10,"i won't spit hate on the show because of last few episodes didn't go well (or the season 8 as people say), yes i agree the last season did feel a bit rushed (some plots were skipped) but overall i'm ok with it. i think we as a fan base do owe the cast some respect for their efforts to make this show. yes, we all did wait a long time for this final season, but from the cast pov, i think they put their hearts out in making this final season, so hate won't justify their hardwork."
2019-05-18,hoevkerturtle,One of the all-time greatest series everIt seemed,10,i do have to say the final season is definitely a let down. it feels like they rushed through the storyline rather than having more episodes in the final season of the series. it seems like they had a list of things that they needed to offer closure to so they just checked them off with a simple answer and not much thought went into closing out the series. shame on you writers for robbing yourselves and all of us fans of what could of been the most monumental season and series ever. you gave up a legacy that could've lasted through the years.
2019-06-18,carolynpickering,From modest beginnings to masterpiece.,9,"i just again watched got from start to finish. this binge only reinforced the joy i felt watching it through the years, especially the last 4 seasons. when i first saw season 1 i did not rate it highly, i judged it as another sex, sandal and blood soaked hbo show. but i persevered and also read the original material from grrm. the rewatching and the brilliant art of the past few seasons made this series truly memorable in all the good ways. amazing world building, tense, emotive yet sometimes subtle drama, superb acting, beautiful and haunting music, special effects with no par and a extremely satisfying story conclusion. thanks to everyone who brought this story to life on our tv screens. i can only hope it opens doors for other amazing fantasy stories to be told with the same excellence. brilliant series."
2019-05-11,filippirgos,"Was there with Breaking Bad, but after Season 8 it will sadly become a meme",10,"seasons 1,4 10/10. seasons 5-6 9/10
season 7 8/10
season 8 3/10.overall that gives the average of 8.6/10 so it should be 9, but i'll give it 8 because writing of season 8 leaves show with absolutely no rewatch value.don't know what to say besides i am very disappointed, and the infamous expression ""subverting expectations"" will probably be what we will remember from this show."
2019-05-21,neostarsx,Best TV show ever,10,first season was amazing and last season was action pack and great.
2021-04-23,maestrogreatrex,Terrible Ending To A Great Show!,10,yeah for 8 seasons they built up a huge fight to a dragon burning people and a town down and the bad army gave up and threw down their weapons. the bad leader hid with her brother under this basement and it collapsed on them. seriously stupidest ending... ever.
2020-09-19,itsm-1,Boring soap opera,9,"2 first episodes were entertaining, then it's all soap opera , just with uninteresting dialog. so boring! i don't understand why all this fuzz about this show (!?)."
2019-04-27,andyrobertsounds,poor show,10,"this is a very mediocre delusional show . the last kingdom is a much better show.
seems everyone has been tricked to consume this junk good taste product .
this show is combining dragons with witches with zombies controlled by ""ice cyborgs"" and with kings and queens that use armies to battle for land .....
those ""ice cyborgs"" have special spears that can kill huge dragons .
in season 7 one ""ice cyborg"" was able to kill one of those 3 huge dragons and after that he turned the dragon into a living controlled zombie probably using nano technology .
probably those ""ice cyborgs"" are alien demons or something .
it's up to your intellectual level to realize what is wrong with this good taste junk food show.
the last kingdom is much more realistic ."
2019-05-20,andyrobertsounds,Don't be fooled the dragon queen is not dead she will return in season 9,10,don't be fooled the dragon queen is not dead she will return in season 9. the dragon will bring her back to life after putting her body in a magical lake .
2014-05-12,fuz_12,This show has everything!,10,"this show has almost every possible element to attract fans from all ages. a political drama in a mythical backdrop this show is so captivating and keeps you on your toes the entire time and one keeps asking for more. one won't even realize 50 minutes can get over so fast! the show doesn't necessarily divert from the book, but when it does, one can find it to be a pleasant surprise. performances. brilliant. storyline. brilliant. the supernatural element is an interesting mix, and surprisingly doesn't disappoint the viewers. though the cast is enormous and its easy for a fan to forget some characters and minor story lines easily.. a true fan will find that the little things matter and add onto the spice. the show doesn't hold back in any form of nudity (male or female) neither on gruesome and torturous scenes. all i can say is, if you've not watched the show, give it one episode. it's enough to capture your minds and hearts."
2019-12-30,t-eugen,Good show,1,good show but bad last seasson. it's a must watch and withot seasson 8 it would be 10/10.
2021-08-15,lcmc1,Great from episode 1,10,"this show kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. one of those shows that flies by when watching it.the plot, acting and settings were all fantastic.i will likely rewatch the whole show again one day and highly recommend it."
2019-07-29,chamberb5,Excellent series except for the last season,9,"the negative review are true relative to the last season and especially the last episode. it's almost like they purposely trashed all the character arcs and build up but i think it was simply poor writing. still, this is one of the best shows that's ever been on tv."
2019-05-20,joystyk,from the 1st to the 7th season 10. 8th s. 4,10,"the first 7 season was spectacular,magnificent,gorgeous. the last one was horrible but anyway i suggest to all to watch this masterpiece. rest in peace got"
2019-12-09,austindroke18,Great series ruined by a horrible ending,9,i loved got ever since it was first aired in 2011 and i've been a fan of it for 8 years but the last season really ruined it for me got really should've of ended at season 7 id say watch the show till season 7 and skip 8
2014-12-10,televisionseriesreviews,One of a kind,10,"i haven't read any of the books and therefore i wasn't a fan of this series beforehand. this means that my review is based purely on the television series itself, regardless whether or not it stays true to the books.when i watched the first episode of ""game of thrones"" on hbo i immediately knew this was going to be a one of a kind. first of all the magnitude of this production is nothing less than what you'd expect from a hollywood blockbuster epic. although episode one begins with interweaving events which happen in various locations within the fictional continent of westeros, the characters begin to emerge rather early in the story, and the likable ones are easy to engage with.most of the actors are very good at portraying their character, and it's only the odd one here and there who seems a little bit off, but having said that with such a large cast and so many day players it is expected. one of my personal favorite actors in this series is sean bean as ned stark, and it's a real shame that we don't get to see more of him after season one. peter dinklage is simply great as tyrion lannister, and i quite liked jason momoa's character, khal drogo.what's beautiful about this series is that you truly never know what's going to happen next. anyone could be killed, there are no ""heroes"" in this story, everyone is vulnerable in some way."
2020-12-26,jjvel0303,To all new fans/viewers,8,"to all new fans/viewers start watching at s6 e10 onwards to the end. just bear with it, i promise you it only gets better from there. then try backtracking to the previous seasons and treat them as prequels. you will definitely be rewarded. never say i didn't warn you"
2019-05-20,rachelvanwelzen,From 10 to 1 in 2 episodes,3,this show was great except for the last season i am very disappointed and disgusted with how the ending turned out. very bad writing and nothing makes sense. it's like they wanted to go out with a bang so they just killed half of them and mentally destroy the others. awful ending and i very much regret even starting on this show wish i could take it back
2021-02-28,kcintron,Thrilling from start to end,10,"besides the cruel and explicit way to shown human fight for the power, i found this production very unique. amazing cast, epic scenarios and production quality combined with a trilling plot. the only reason i don't give this tv series a straight 10 rating is because i was expecting a more dramatic ending for the main villian but it was worth watching."
2015-08-04,aoshina,How the HELL does this have a 9.5 on IMDb?,3,"i'm just going to say it: game of thrones is a grossly, grossly, grossly overrated series. people act like this is one of the greatest series ever made. i say that's bullshit! game of thrones is so f*cking boring. the plot lines are everything we've seen in this type of story before. every episode feels formulaic. it drags along often. the acting is subpar. sometimes the actors seem more interested in the money they are about to get than the roll they are portraying. other times they are way overacting to where it just gets annoying. the set design, while nice looking, is still generic as all hell. it is the same forest and ""mythological environments that we've seen in lord of the rings or princess bride. i cannot believe this lasted more than a season and has a rating of a nine point f*cking five on imdb! it's not the worst show ever but it should not be grouped with shows like breaking bad. oh, and did i mention that the fanbase is almost as bad as the bronies?"
2019-12-21,eisasawalhi,A masterpiece turns to a piece of sh**!,10,"what drove me to watch game of thrones is the fame of this show, everyone was talking about how great it is, and i watched it before season 8 came out on april, and i binged watching the 7 seasons in 1,2 weeks, all the time i was like ""no one can beat this show, what a masterpiece!!"", it was all the definition of cinema perfection from all the sides except for one thing that used to bother me; the acting skills of the lead characters, they're good but not great as the show. i liked how it was dramatic, thrilling and mysterious with no limits, i like how it was deep and meaningful, there are certain scenes that equals millions of episodes from another shows!! but, season 8, like what is going on, why would you ruin this amazing world with this rush, irrational and nonsense way, i was bored that i watched the end scene from the last episode, the only thing was perfect is emilia'a acting, she really developed herself, but the storylines was perfect and they really ruined it so baaad. i rate all the seasons 'except 8"": 10/10, so that's why i'd like to rate the show 10/10.."
2020-06-25,themediaguru24,Great Till the Last Season,9,"game of thrones was easily the best show on tv, even possibly ever until the last 1.5 seasons where the show drops the ball.season 1,6 where this slow build up to some of the greatest battles ever put onto tv, the characters where all so well built apart from bran who was the weakest character. the show constantly has tension running throughout it because after episode 9 of the first season no one is safe, this was definitely what made the show so appealing to me. season 1 was a great first season to a show which would constantly improve as the show went on, it sets up tension and character arcs perfectly while building up some battles which we will get to see. season 2 is great although one of the weaker seasons, it has the first big battle which is an absolute spectacle and worth the slower first half of the show. season 3 is amazing, some consider this the best season, it has some of the biggest gut punches and twists in the entire show. season 4 in my opinion is the best that the show has to offer, some of the greatest moments and written dialogue is in this season, in which after finishing this season you will not want to stop watching. season 5 is fine, nothing spectacular until the final half of the season where you get some great battles and one of the biggest cliffhangers of all time. season 6 has amazing buildup and payoff, with undoubtedly the best battle the show has to offer. battle of the bastards will leave you grasping for air and worried for which characters will make it out alive, personally this is my second favorite season. season 7 starts off great but it is just amazingly directed battles and not the show that was all about building and taking it's time to these battles. also this season has a lot of plot armor which is a shame because it doesn't feel like game of thrones anymore and just a standard medieval fantasy show. it does give us some great payoff to characters though it which helped make it a good season.season 8 is awful, in my opinion it almost destroyed the love i had for this show, awful pacing for game of thrones, plot armor in almost every episode, respawning armies and characters being completely changed because they wanted to subvert expectations. some big characters are now just there to create conflict or do something which was extremely eye rolling. the ending was one of the worst in tv history and personally i would never watch anything from season 8 again apart from episode 3 maybe.overall this show was great for 7 seasons then just completely fell on its head in the final season to make for one of the worst final seasons in tv history. check it out but be ready for disappointment in the final season."
2019-07-07,isaacsmith-20448,This Show is Almost a Perfect 10,9,"i originally gave this show a 10, but after the poorly scripted final season, i changed it to a 9. still one of the best shows ever."

2019-07-30,metboyie,NERD ALERT! NERD ALERT!,8,"fact: got is a show for nerds who still haven't lost their viriginity to anything other than a tissue. the show is fillied with swords and boring nerd things like dragons and politics. in one scene, twinkle dingus gets his willy cut off. i must admit i found it very entertaing, but i don't thing that scene was appropriate for children. this makes me question why the series is rated got (generally for oll types of people). it should be rated r for nerds.the last season was good bc dragon burns the city down. i especially enjoyed the sexy blonde chick snaps and blows up a city bc shes salty.the tv show has sex, so close your eyes kids. unfortunately, these are not experienced adult film actors/actresses and the form is sloppy. however, the majority of the audience is virgin nerds so they will not be able to tell that it aint good no.im excited for sonic movie instead of this drama.,rusty"
2019-02-20,ali_ebrahim,Setting high benchmarks for future TV shows & movies,10,"from the opening scene followed by the amazing ""game of thrones"" tune, you know you're in for something very special. game of thrones shows off his high budget and really immediately draws you into its beautiful created fantasy world. from the start they show they mean business and you soon realize that you have never seen a tv show like this. its beautiful landscapes, cities and the amazing diverse set of characters is mindblowing. from the beginning you get to know these great characters and you get to get really involved in them, whether you love a certain character or you absolutely dispise a certain character, game of thrones does it really well and it feels like you get to know these characters really well over the course of the current 7 seasons. all i can say is.... fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the ride, get ready to be amazed, get ready to be shocked, you will cry, you will be in awe, this show has it all. an absolute masterpiece that will leave all tv shows behind itself and makes you wish for more as soon as you have watched the last episode. warning: this show does contain shocking scenes that might not be for everyone.final verdict: this is isn't just a tv show its an experience not to be missed, a must watch for anyone who loves a great story, great characters and doesn't mind the occasional shock value!! oh and did i mention..... it has dragons!!!! enjoy everyone😉👍"

2019-05-20,bigpapastimp-33810,Amazing,10,"shame that a few have complained about season eight, and have started a petition for crybabies to remake season 8, take no notice as it's only a small amount off the fans that don't get it and didn't get the ending they wanted ! if anything it gets better and better as the seasons go on. yes season 8 was a bit all too much to fit in and could off easily done a season 9 but it doesn't take away the fact that it's a well written fantasy story with great characters and a lot of unsuspected brutal twists. a bit slow to start with the first two seasons then after that it gets a lot better and better. great job too the writers and cast and everyone involved as this is a great series. bring on the prequel!"

2017-05-08,shawnman-56268,The Best T.V. Show Ever?,6,"maybe. this show is amazing (except for bran's storyline which is just rather boring) but i ignore that because the rest of the show is fantastic. there is a beautiful mix between violence, intrigue, story, and a little humor. i have never felt a real hate for anybody in any film medium as i have whilst watching this show, and i have never felt as much stress and been on the edge of my seat as i have during this show. even the fourth and fifth seasons (which weren't as good as the others) were better than anything else i have watched. with the film industry going downhill, it is refreshing to see that television is getting better and better. and this show is at the forefront."
2019-04-30,panoskyprianou-34478,Whats wrong with people???,10,epic episode..... the writers know vet well what they are doing.... neacuse the biggest enemy is yet to come!!!!!
2020-05-08,rsaikamesh,Idiotic ending for a great show,6,"season 1,6 were excellent. the story, screenplay and emotions, they all got it right. season 7 is also good. felt a bit rushed but good enough to watch. then comes season 8, just to spoil all the story and emotions that have been built since the beginning. season 8 is like sansa stark sooo dumb and hateful, no one likes her and so does the season 8. night king is a joke. all the build up they gave from season 1 is nothing. and arya killing night king is another big joke. they made it look very silly. fans have only cared for daenerys targaryen and those idiots killed her. i mean why not kill the most dumb characters like sansa and bran. i don't understand what's the importance of their roles. sansa has done nothing but be a dumb b*tch. well so is bran, he too did nothing. i am done watching it. now i completely lost interest on the prequel of game of thrones. i don't see a reason to care about the prequels. i mean we all know it ends with bran as king no matter what. if you still want to watch got go ahead watch until season 6 and just stop right away. you can watch season 7 if you want but don't even dare to watch season 8. it just makes everything worst since the beginning. i didn't listened to people when they said me not to watch season 8. i watched season 8 and now game of thrones is completely ruined for me. save yourselfs form the worst season ever."

2019-05-20,tomferlito,The final 2 seasons disqualify the show.,1,that's all you need to know. they said the review was too short but there is nothing else to say really. they blew it.
2019-12-10,finncoglini,Had potential,2,"had potential to be amazing. the scenery was awesome the animation, actors etc all great, but a total waste. there were only 2 main characters i liked: daenerys and jon snow. and they absolutely ruined daenerys' ending. i don't mind the sex & violence scenes but it got to a point where there was so much that it took away from the actually story.
but my main problem was the absolute trash 8th season and ending. it was like they got bored and were like, let's just hurry up and finish this.overall it wasn't terrible, and i really wanted to like it but the last season completely ruined it for me."

2019-03-17,natefromtiburon,Amazing,8,"great storytelling, good acting, great plot, great effects, and almost always consistent in quality. the only seasons that weren't quite as consistent as the others were 5 and 7. but 5 has some redeeming qualities (hardhome). 7 has good episodes but it seems like the show runners wanted to end the show quickly so it feels very rushed, the quality is as good as the other seasons but the pacing was terrible."

2021-05-20,elvisedison,Could have been the best!,6,"last 2 seasons could have been a lot better with some more writing. from 7th season onwards it got a little illogical, like they were fooling the viewers. they could have made the great war ep with night king more realistic. magically many survived the war. they could have given more back story to the night king. ending could have been better. i have many questions, which will not find answers!"

2019-05-04,natie9,I love this show but this episode was a great disappointment.,10,"i love this show, and one of the biggest reasons why i love it so much is because of how incredibly complex and realistic the storytelling is despite it being a fantasy show. however, this episode took away all that made this show so great in the first place and i have never been so disappointed in my life.overall the build up, the action, acting and special effects were amazing in this episode, but the writing was not. first of all, the plot armor for most of the main characters was similar to a typical hero saves the day hollywood movie (which is not what got stands for). theon and jorahs death was beautifully made, but the fact that jon was surrounded by hundreds of whights and still somehow survived was absolutely ridiculous. same with most of the characters, especially jamie and brienne.but the thing that disappointed me the most was how the night king and the white walkers died, it was way too easy. i don't have any problems with arya killing the night king, i think that was awesome that she ended up killing him, especially with all her training with the faceless men, but it was the way he died that felt so incredibly anti climatic and again, way way too easy. 9 years of build up for it to be over just like that?. there are so many questions left unanswered.this makes me worried for the upcoming episodes, now i feel like the writers have a chance to mess up an otherwise amazing story and ruin everything that made the show so great in the first place.1/10 because i want to bring the ratings down, so that maybe the writers will realize how much they messed it up."

2019-06-23,dodolazza,The only one to deserve a 10 out of 10,10,"many years will pass before something near this tv show will appear ever again. i sincerely can't think about any other tv show that deserves such a rating (except maybe the one with ww, maybe...). without any doubt the photography and music are the best ever, no discussion about them, ramin djawadi has created the best soundtrack ever. for what concerns the writing of seasons 7 and 8, well... you can start a never ending digression about them, but i'm sure that the first six seasons are enough to consider got incomparable."
2019-05-20,nopephed,Season 8 ruined the entire series,10,"seasons 1,3: very good television, well done.season 4: pretty good but something is wrong.seasons 5-6: choppy waters, we're not far from the lifeline. has some bright spots but also a bunch of stuff that doesn't make sense.seasons 7-8: 100% pure, unrefined garbage. ruins everything, renders the entire series unwatchable."
2020-06-14,nyrfan2000,For all the bandwagon jumpers...,10,"it's so easy to go along with the crowd. everyone bashing season 8 and saying how much they hate the ending. really? i suggest you go back and watch the entire series again, at least once if not more. then tell me how season 8 was so bad. i've watched the entire series four times- each time seeing things and understanding things in a new way. if you watch carefully, the sad take of daenerys is foreshadowed almost from season 1, when her brother is killed by drogo. why anyone would be surprised by dany torching kings landing is beyond me. madness runs in the family. i will agree that the last third of the final episode is anticlimactic. the choice of brandon as the king was disappointing to say the least. but to trash all 6 episodes of season 8 is ludicrous. still the best tv series of all time. looking forward to watching it a fifth time!"
2019-09-22,mblue78,"Great production, authentic ending",8,"i enjoyed the tv production more than the books which is a first. the final season 8 seems to have disappointed some, but not me. i thought it had many awesome scenes, and a very fitting ending. i also really liked that it didn't end in a big fake hollywood way, it was a little sad, surprising and open ended."

2020-05-01,renegadehermit,"Not really 10, more like a 9.5",7,"the first 6 seasons where they adapted the books were amazing. they left some things out however and personally they should have put in the show to at least have george maybe flesh out more of the plot for them for season 7 and 8. it seemed they forgot how time worked and how to properly show character development when they didn't have a book in front of them. despite my gripes with the ending season 1,6 was possible the best television i've ever seen and season 7 was alright too. the first 3 episodes of season 8 were great they just happen to take an epic drop after that."

2021-08-07,aimtomisbehave,Seasons 7 and 8 negated the entire series,1,"in their rush to pursue other projects and their arrogance and selfishness in not handing the series over to other show runners and better writers, they ruined it.we can forgive the fact that there were so many continuity errors and stupid mistakes like coffee cups and water bottles left in scenes. i understand that things were chaotic and crew members can be forgiven.what is unforgivable is the unnecessarily furious pace, abandonment of plot points and lack of progress in key characters' arcs.having dany turn into the mad queen was pointless, there was no hero's redemption for jamie, jon snow's revelation that he's both a targaryen and a stark...and then bran the useless becoming king?so much wasted potential.i wish these guys would never get another job in hollywood again."
2020-12-04,shashanksunny-03064,Couldn't get any much BETTER,6,"so just finished one of my favourite shows on my watchlist and it's definitely going to my favourites besides breaking bad and stranger things. there are especially 2 main things i do want to write one is music and other is sets. man, the sets are so good that you feel that there is actually a westeroas in the real world. the graphics are great but in the whole season there are only two or three scenes where you feel that the graphics are graphics. you can actually see that. and casting is one of the most positive aspect. the actors just loved in the characters. at first you feel that this charecter is good and in the next season you will like him especially jamie lannister. the stories of each character is so good that you want to see more of it of each character. and the ending couldn't be any better. so one thing if you do want to see a series having all emotions of a human check this out. this will be a worth your while."

2020-11-24,jdowie-78560,Masterpiece,10,"a truly wonderful creation. beautiful scenes and perfectly casted with cgi at its best. yes, it's very violent and full of language you wouldn't normally hear during afternoon tea but it's what you signed up for. easily watched again and again in any order just to soak up all bits you may have missed, or scenes you can't stop watching for its brilliance. an outstanding fantastical masterpiece of a true genius's imagination."
2021-09-01,spudd-43203,An amazing show ruined.,10,"as most of the reviews here point out, got was absolutely top notch until the last season. an earlier review indicated that george martin had a disagreement with the show runners and left the project. if that is indeed the case it would explain the drop in quality of s8...am wondering if the writers were also responsible for the fast & furious 9 disaster.the author has also indicated that the yet to be completed book series would take the story to a different conclusion. i am hoping that is true so us fans still have something to look forward to. the omissions of many characters and story lines from the books was disappointing but i suppose necessary considering how epic the whole saga is. i sincerely hope that george is able to complete the story.the final season did however have some good moments and character performances. tyrion, as always was outstanding, as was cersi, although her lack of screen time was criminal. the hound and arya friendship has been the best show stealer throughout the series and i feel their story concluded well. podrick, gendry, tormond, davos, sam tarly, many more...all good. jon snow has been the hero from the get go, so very disappointing to see him spend most of s8 making whiny speeches to justify his poor decisions. i could spend hours picking holes in characters and praising others but anyone who's watched all the way through will be able to form their own opinion. 8/10 for this one because most of it is outstanding except for the final season."
2020-12-31,wuapktjphq,Brilliant!,10,the most vibrant television series of all times. one who dares to give a rating lower than 10 does not appreciate the magnificent story depicted in game of thrones. epic and unique. you can feel every single moment of this show!
2021-01-14,joodnfc,Got the legand,10,the session one till 5 have active watching but last season they sad finally
2021-07-12,ironfanwithvan,Just what happend,7,on of the greatest shows of all time ending with the amazing season 4 and going slowly down hill.watch until season 4 if you want closer watch until season 6 but don´t touch season 7 and 8. 8 is probably one of the worst things i have ever seen you can tell they had no more book material and the writers were just lazy and didn´t care anymore. it´s really sad because the show looks amazing in the later parts of the show the story is just so bad.
2013-06-21,markmullen777,There's no shield surfing here!,10,"no matter how good something is (and no matter how terrible) you always have a small group of people who will disagree with the majority. even when a show like game of thrones comes along there are still people who will inexplicably give it one star reviews. that's just nuts. myself, i hate generic brainless tv shows like csi but, being fair i think i would rate csi miami five out of ten. it's ridiculous tosh, but it's still has some positive elements to it. one of the fundamental problems with imdb is people vote in an almost political way by unfairly giving a movie or tv show one star or for that matter ten stars, in an attempt to lower or raise the overall score. i thought of giving game of thrones a nine because i very rarely ever give anything a ten. but then, despite not being perfect, it is one of the best and possibly most important tv series ever made. for me the sopranos is currently the most important tv show of my generation. not just because it was great, but because every episode had the production values of a high budget movie. it made people realise that tv can not only be as good as a movie, but it can actually be better due the fact that you only spend ninety minutes with the characters of most movies as opposed to perhaps ten hours to the average hbo series. then there's also the unscrupulous nature of hollywood and it's grab the cash and run policies. a tv series gives you the time needed for a complex plot to unravel and to actually care about three dimensional and detailed characters as in a book. how many movies have failed to live up to the greatness of a book? i would argue most of them. cloud atlas being a recent example of a novel failing to have the same impact on the big screen. even the lord of the rings saga (which i still think are great) look suddenly dated and thin when put side by side with game of thrones. even with the extended editions, peter jackson and his team struggled to fit everything in. despite plenty of positive changes, lord of the rings contained plenty of silly hollywood 'additions'. i'm talking of things like legolas doing some shield surfing in the battle of helm's deep. there's no shield surfing in game of thrones. if anybody tried to mount a shield and surf it down some steps in battle there would be someone like sandor clegane to grimly cut his head off and stick it on a spike for trying to be a smart arse. so game of thrones is important really important. it obviously has a large budget, that whilst not as high as hollywood blockbuster, is still sufficient to make every episode look movie quality and to bring in an accomplished ensemble cast. you may never have heard of plenty of them. but they can certainly show some of those overpaid hollywood a,listers a thing or two.so what's so good? - well we have a great cast from sean bean, peter dinklage, liam cunnigham, michelle fairley, aiden gillen, james cosmo to name but a few. these may not be household names but you will recognise many faces and perhaps all the better for not being pampered a-listers. sean bean seems like he was born to play ned stark. i said that of him when he played sharpe. but hey, he plays a grim northerner really well.we have great costumes, sets and backdrops which bring the world of westeros to life in ways i wouldn't have thought possible. one minute we are the miserable frozen north, the next we are in beautiful sunny climes of kings landing. - the series sticks close to the books and doesn't deviate for 'a larger audience' or try to simply the complex and deviating plot. there's some simplifying here and there as the plot is so complex and often confusing it requires is when being condensed from such huge novels. - there are no good guys and bad guys, everyone is a shade of grey (except for queen cersei she's a wench!) but the story is not the same old generic nonsense that hollywood, and tv companies around the world churn out again and again and again. this is actually trying to be, you know, different. further, allies and friends on all sides or unreliable depending which way they the wind is blowing. - characters develop throughout the story dramatically. it's hard not to go into detail and give away spoilers. but for better or worse all of the characters go through a lot and we feel like we've been through it with them. just look at jaime lanister from series one and then at the end of series three. it looks like a different actor is playing him. - it can have a massive emotional impact of you life! again, not to reveal any spoilers but there are some dramatic moments. i'm not the kind of person to usually let it bother me. but after some episodes i have felt greatly affected by the events on screen to the characters i have come to like so much. season three has just ended a couple of weeks ago and i still feel a little emotional looking back at recent events. - there are some legendary characters, quotes, places... the list goes on. the word's of game of thrones have officially blasted their way into popular culture. - the soundtrack is brilliant. ramin djawadi has produced some of the finest classical music in years.so, if you've made it all the way here, well done and thanks for reading. now, seven hells, go and watch game of thrones for the night is dark and full of terrors."
2017-09-06,tzarr0,What's the big fuss about this show?,10,"this show is in fact 3 disjointed story,lines ... that only come together at middle of season 7. the story of fire and the story of ice ... were merely used as devices ... to keep the audience buying the main story-line ... which was also the main focus of the show ... as for the main story of the show ... a medieval game of thrones ... we have only 3 major houses ... that actually impact the story ... with only lannisters being allowed to move pieces on the game board ... the role of the other houses being only to react and counteract. while lannisters are full featured by the writers ... strong military, best diplomats and schemers, filthy rich, best strategical position in the heart of westeros, no taboos, the other houses are either too weak, too poor, too honorable, too divided. so the lannisters always get on top ... even when their realm of possibilities is null ... something ... miraculous ... happens ... and they turn the table. at the end of season 7 ... the ruling power of house lannisters ... from the beginning ... cersei lannister ... with the weakest position in the history of negotiations, and weakest poker-face ever, still manage to foul everybody ... this is how weak the writing of this show really is.the show struggle from the beginning to foul the audience that it aims for realism ... so it obsessively promotes 3-4 anti-stereotypes usually found in history dramas and fantasy shows also introduce an insane amount of unnecessary and redundant characters ... so they can be killed afterwards ... following what they believe to be impressive and shocking visual effects. it is this lie ... which hooked a massive shallow and dull audience (twd shared) to the show in the first place ... along with a massive marketing crusade ... unseen in any television show. otherwise ... the show feature ... dragons, undead, resurrections, prophecies, visions, shadows and all the fantasy themed stuff ... running along (but not interacting) with an highly unrealistic medieval politics mechanic, aftermath and characters. it looks like it wants to be both ... but fails and it is none.as far as the mechanic of westeros ... and westerosi archetype ... i found an insane amount of contradictions ... despite being a patriarchal system (you will not see a female soldier, guard,...) ... it is 2 women that actually manage to make the ultimate power-play. in a world that is profoundly corrupt and limited to gold as ultimate value (which can be translated in sex and multiplication as the final goals) ... the westerosi ... manage somehow to summon ... a sacred respect for royal traditions, to acknowledge bloodlines and bent knees, be xenophobic and racist at the same time ... it is like the worst values the human races manage to uncover and promote ... in ten millenniums of written history ... no matter how contradictory ... the westerosi ... will have them ... all at once!to resume ... got ... it is unrealistic, uninspiring, very slow paced, poorly written ... with contradictory rules ... which ultimately create a flawed world mechanic! the characters and their goals ... are predictable and simplistic. the story-lines are disjointed for 90% of the show time. the show struggle to be both fantasy and political medieval drama ... and fail at both counts."
2011-06-22,banteros,Outstanding series,10,"ok, the season is over and i have read several reviews here so now i guess it's my turn simply because i have been overwhelmed by this series.first, i have never read the books prior to watching this. i rarely watch tv so i missed the hype. i actually stumbled across a mention of this online while surfing the web on the day that the premiere aired. the name sounded familiar and sure enough, i had heard of the books but never read them, not being a huge fantasy fan. so i thought i'd try it.wow, am i ever glad i did! this is the most astounding tv show i have seen since the first season of ""lost."" the characters are entertaining, the story is gripping and the acting is fantastic. for the first time in years i eagerly awaited the next episode of a tv show and was never disappointed.this isn't your typical fantasy story. first, harry potter or lord of the rings this definitely is not. this is for adults! there is a lot of violence, some gory some just shocking, and a lot of sex. someone else mentioned they were upset because the people who were mentioning the sex didn't mention the incest involved. well that's probably because it's an integral part of the story and could be considered a spoiler! others also mention that it's too weird for a ""historical"" piece. umm, no. this is not a historical piece, ala ""camelot."" this takes place in a fictional universe in a fictional time. this is not our earth.if you have not seen it and have hbo then go to on demand or hbo go and watch it. if you don't have hbo then order the dvd's when they become available. this is epic. 10 stars.oh, and peter dinklage deserves an emmy."
2012-01-11,jengiscan2000,Excellent swords and sorcery behemoth!,10,"a friend recommended this series to me and i have to say i was not to keen but i have a 13 year old son and i thought we could watch it together. having both played the elder scrolls series of computer games, morrowind, oblivion and the latest skyrim ,dragons included, we were both struck as to how similar it was. however it is in every way a superior example of the genre brought to life on the screen. the acting is superb, costumes, sets and cgi all blend seamlessly into a visual feast for the eyes. i would recommend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in this sort of medieval fantasy world. all i can say is hbo better not do a deadwood or rome and just wander off to pastures new leaving the fans all wanting more.just wait until those dragons reach adolescence!"
2019-05-15,rhik,The rightful queen of the seven kingdoms.,9,"i don't understand why everyone is calling daenerys, the mad queen.isnt it the normal reaction? she had a traumatic childhood, an abusive brother who literally sold her to suitors in an attempt to reach the throne. she virtually rose to this level of championship, building brick by brick winning everybody's trust, freeing people from tyranny, passing through the fire test, not once but twice, giving rise to the age of dragons. she rose to that level by herself. it was her who had faith on the dragon eggs when everyone advised her to sell them off, she was the one who had faith, that one day, they would lead her to her freedom.one must not forget, it's for her mercy that jon and his company was saved from the night walkers the first time, leading to the fall of visyrys, the first dragon. the battle of winterfell was long lost, without her assistance , in which she lost most of the dothraki and sir jorah, who was probably one of her only well,wisher, in the true sense.most of the others she trusted, either betrayed her stabbing her in the back or showed cold resistance when their mission was accomplished, like jon, even though they had played allegiance to her before the job was done, the battle of the long night. whatever it takes to get your work done, right? the kind of hostility, she receives from the stark family, even after she was defending their cause at a great cost to her was shocking. it was only because she was a noble queen. she could have just refused and torched the north to the grounds too. afterall she was always a one man army.again look for instance her counsellors from king's landing, always hatching plans to overthrow the order. even in the end, varys had been plotting to poison her to make jon the king, and then after few days he would plot against him too. nobody is perfect. i mean where is the end!daenerys saw her second dragon being shot from the sky by euron's arrow and missandi beheaded in front of her. noone showed any merci then. did the people of the kl show any mercy during ned stark's trial or even cersei's walk? no, right? there's nothing called mercy. as she said, if not by love, then by fear it is. they rang the bell, but then what, had she stopped fighting they might have just killed her army and shot drogon and cersei might have remained the ruler. you can never trust anyone, not even your own men. and even if not that, they would have overthrown her in a short time and made jon the ruler. was that the ending she deserved?the only mistake on her part, was she fell in love. crazy things, people do for love. for which she lost everyone and probably would lose what she was destined for, in the final episode. adios, queen daenerys targaryen, you fought well and you showed path to many who are lost. 😊"
2013-06-14,tania_ap,"Amazing atmosphere but in the end, something was missing for me...",6,"i know that i am probably in the minority here, but i do not hold game of thrones in such a high esteem as the rest of the viewers. i have not read the books so my opinion only has to do with the show as a tv product. i find the acting, the soundtrack and the atmosphere of the series amazing. but in the end, i never find myself eager to watch the next episode for some reason. i love fantasy series and i devour series with action, battles and politics. i loved spartacus and i didn't mind the nude and sex scenes. in game of thrones though i find many scenes too disturbing. i also find that i do not care for many characters so much as i should. the first season was for me the best. every character was given enough time, for us to learn about him and his story...but in season 2 and 3 we only see every character for a few minutes and sometimes not in every episode. i know that this is the way it is supposed to be but it keeps me from getting invested in them. everything involves so slowly for me that in the end when i have to choose an episode from any series to watch, game of throne is almost always my final choice despite being a superior production to most shows out there right now..."
2019-04-29,pinar-sak,Perfect!,8,the greatest scene ever !! so appreciated.. i watched how mancy times i cannot remember!
2019-05-28,roger-gray,OK but no LotR,7,"didn't like the first season. stuck with it. got caught up and had great fun until the end which is a sure sign of ""let's rush this so we can get paid by disney to write star wars"" toss!"
2014-04-22,hut_syndrom,90 minutes episodes,10,"each episode is usually about 55 minutes long, take out the ridiculous 2 minutes (!) intro and final credits and you get 52 minutes which suppose to cover more than 10 story lines. in a good episode we get to see about half of them. in a very good episode something actually happens in the sub plots. sooner or later we will get tired of waiting, so why not to put some more meat into the story and make longer episodes?don't tell me it will be expensive because they will cover it with 3 more commercials..there is more than enough material to write longer episodes and the production value of the series will be able to hold it. who else think that each episode should be 90 minutes long?"
2019-05-21,peter-alexandris,Confusing,10,"i know this is the most loved series but i just began watching. i made it thru 7 episodes but honestly, wtf is even going on? way too many characters are introduced. im so lost. did this show loose anyone else cause it was hard to follow."
2012-03-30,georgegates,Takes the Throne of Crapiness,10,"after two episodes i still couldn't get into the series, there is no emotional buildup or character development. the rest of the series i fast,forwarded through, dwelling about 5 to 7 minutes on each episode. i stopped in episode 6.here's what you get: -one-dimensional stereotyped characters ""we don't care"" for -infinite boring dialogs -bleak film sets devoid of modern visuals and cgi -animal killings: nytheria (wolf) and the beheading of a horse early on. this wouldn't bother me if the wolf hadn't been the one likable character on the show -tons of bleak looking medieval stuff-a storyline excruciatingly following the book series -nudity could aid the series, in got it is misplaced and women are debased (e.g. a knight just beheaded someone and proclaims to his newfound lad whether he would like to lay with a woman now, as he usually does after gorefests - right in front of the queen). that's the general attitude towards females of the whole series ""spartacus"" is female emancipation compared to this show -dated. the series might as well have been made three decades ago. there is nothing revolutionary. it is purely fan driven.-devoid of fantasy (normally i would like that, except in got this means more endless hard to follow dialogue on the backdrop of beak-looking sets).the best proof that this show is only watched by fanboys and girls can be seen directly in the imdb ratings. 98% rate the show a 10/10. fantasy at its best."
2021-08-06,mbevin,Ending completely ruins the whole show,10,"one could argue that just because the last season is completely abysmal, that shouldn't detract from early seasons. however, when so much of the show is build,up for the finale - storylines you have to wade through for seasons in the hope+expectation they're going somewhere - then the final season's awfulness really does detract from the entire product.as an example - the whole white walker build-up and related bran stark storyline just basically comes to nothing. we never even really learn what it was all about, and it just ends so abruptly. similarly danaerys' whole storyline just ends so nonsensically after all the time spent following her. jaime lannister's whole arc ends in a nonsensical mess. etc etc.a show whose core strength was its story+characters - a show which could shock viewers, but always in ways which in the early seasons entirely made sense given the characters' character - devolving into such a nonsensical mess. the last season is a pure cash grab made by talentless people with no interest anymore in working to deliver a half-decent ending to what they'd spent seasons building up. i just hope george r. r. martin actually finishes the last books and manages to give the story a more satisfying ending which shows-up how pathetic in comparison hollywood's attempt to write its own ending was (and yes, of course he is somewhat to blame for not finishing the books before the tv show reached the end)."
2019-05-13,molinapolo,The end of a franchise,10,"last chapters have been a complete disaster for me, to see how they have destroyed everything that was built for 8 years is demeaning. it is as if they got bored suddenly and decided to just dropped the house of cards, let's end this now and we couldn't care less. it's incredible how the producers couldn't came up for something more credible for the audience, i think at this stage we don't care any more of the original story, what we need is a good closure and i think it is absolutely lacking at this moment. i have dropped my rating from 10 to 1."
2019-05-15,stolphenric,2/10 for season 8,10,"oh man was this dissapointing. i will not watch beyond episode 3. i just don't care anymore. one of the 10/10 shows ruined, thanks dumb and dumber."
2019-05-08,robrmcc,Wow what a dumpster fire season 8 is!!,10,"the plot was so thin and the characters so gutted by bad writing in this season that i am not sure who even cares anymore about spoiler alerts. i thought it could only get better after episode 3 but episode 4 was even stupider.i don't usually do reviews but i have to vent somehow. i really was not expecting much in season 8 in spite of the hype but the atrocious writing, thin to ridiculous plot lines and poor cinematography has managed to disappoint even my low expectations.the plot lines and characters have become so stupid they are almost unwatchable. i mean really? daenerys is supposed to be the super queen? how many times can she walk like a dunce into a big cersei trap and get all her men killed before most of them just say forget this i am not following this dunce anymore. she has now managed to stupidly get two of her dragons killed off, and by what bows and arrows!! ha, ha, that's hilarious. why not just fly around the boats and burn them up from behind? they can't shoot arrows through their own rigging and masts!! not to mention there is no way arrows could ever destroy ships like that. especially ridiculous arrows made out of iron!! they would be too heavy to even shoot, have a range of about 10 feet.i give up. it was just too stupid to even make any more omments about it.sad, sad, sad stuff.not sure i am going to even watch the last two episodes."
2020-01-13,jockette,Just awesome,8,"i came late to got on tv , finally starting to watch around the time s8 was launched. so i pretty much knew of the characters and storylines as i watched the whole series. this meant no (major) surprises, and limited emotional impact re how good/bad the series became over the years. in my view, the whole series rates as a 10/10. some episodes better/worse than others, of course. but as an engaging and gripping series it blew me away.*high points* the purple wedding (joff is so evil, got his just desserts indeed). tyrion's trial - i absolutely loved peter dinklage throughout, but he was awesome here, at his peak performance. i was prepared not to like the various battle episodes (normally multitask during that type of scene), but these were also awesome - particularly hardhome, battle of the bastards, spoils of war.
for individual characters - ned's demise, jaime/brienne (all their scenes), arya/the hound scenes, also her later scenes with gendry. the look of unrequited love in jorah's eyes. hodor & the door. bronn's avarice (although beginning to pall in s8). littlefinger's dawning realisation that he'd been rumbled by the stark ladies. the genuine warmth of the nights watch relationships with each other. so many other great performances, even if not main cast.*low points*
ok - agree with the haters that the long night battle was a strategy fiasco. was never that keen on bran & the 3-eyed raven stuff. dorne storylines seemed superfluous after oberyn's death (which was awesome!). euron - ridiculously ott character. the increasingly unbelievable time-shifts allowing characters to travel across westeros in unfeasible times.i've never binge-watched anything before and was completely obsessed with got. spent half the last season in tears. watched so many episodes through my fingers, such was the gore/shock factor. hard to see what is going to replace it for my evening binge-viewing from now. kudos to all the cast and crew for a completely amazing show."
2017-03-16,legerinia,"Not for kids, but an awesome show to get into.",8,"i've never been much for sci,fi or fantasy shows, and i'm never gonna be like those folks who dress up, at comic con, and spend small fortunes on memorabilia. that being said, this show is the only one i have ever gone ""geek"" over. it came on back in 2011, and i watched it on a free weekend of hbo. after the first episode, i ordered hbo, and began watching it every week. it was pretty cool. it's a great story, and even though it's coming to an end, i really hope they decide to the spin offs from the books i keep hearing about. it's definitely a show my wife and i make sure the kids are in bed first before we watch. a lot of language, sex, violence, and gore in this series, so it's not something you want your kids to watch. i'm looking forward to buying the audio books, to get more out of the plot lines. it's a must watch that will have you hooked into it at the first episode or three. i highly recommend it."
2019-06-04,m_saleh91,Watch till season six finale,10,"unique show from the first minute, if you make the mistake of watching season 7 you will be disappointed, if you sin and watch season 8 you will feel horribly betrayed."
2012-09-19,oznur-geze-1907,Magic world of 'Game Of Thornes',10,"love, betrayal, greed, murder, corruption all collides in mythical world of westeros. where do i start..? game of thrones, is a show like nothing before.i started to watch that and then i can't stop. i watched all seasons at a time.the cast is perfect.costumes are great.scene and photography are amazing.i love all of actors at the series.specially daenerys targaryen.she is my favorite. normally you read the books, and then you watch the movie and you're so disappointed, right? not this time,my friends.this series is great as the book.i'm just saying; sit back and enjoy dear friends. 'winter is coming!'"
2012-08-31,jayden933,A Series that Transcends Typical Genres,7,"my philosophy for the structure of a perfect movie holds true in the realm of tv shows, as emmy award,winning game of thrones brilliantly illustrates. the series transcends the simple and traditional genres of fantasy or myth as its deeply complex story and large, strong cast of rich, colorful, and layered characters convey themes that apply more often to the politics and society of today's world than the mystical middle ages. once you watch game of thrones, you quickly lose the sense that you're watching a fantasy as you're engrossed in the characters' epic stories of a struggle for power, love, loss, betrayal, the quest for justice, identity, coming of age, and so many others. this series is truly one that can easily satisfy any and every viewer. 9.0/10"
2020-04-11,tim-gates-522-762722,Seems very familiar...,10,almost like a series of books i read that were phenomenal. some of the names and places even sound like the ones in the books. it would've been great if someone would've made a tv show or something based on those books.
2019-05-08,kevinparker100,Good show but they missed the point in season Eight.,9,"did they miss the point ?i love this show, so won't mark it down but my oh my did the writers of season 8 not actually see the point of it all ?throughout this entire show, there as only ever been one threat, the real threat. the night king and the army of the dead. maybe it is just my interpretation but he represented something that we can all relate to. he was the great leveller, an unstoppable force, something we ignore at our own peril. he was meant to unite them, put aside their petty squabbles and actually face the consequences of their indifference to events taking place outside of their own little worlds. he represented global warming, plastic pollution, mass extinction, ecological disasters on an unprecedented scale, wars, famine and our own indifference to it all. warnings after warnings had been ignored and he represented pay back. death itself come to reclaim the entire world.this story was never about the iron throne nor who sat on it at the end. through meticulous character development, beautifully crafted storylines and a world steeped in history, we the viewers were drawn in. we could empathise, like, pity, loath or even love them. we, unlike many of the characters in this show could also see the bigger picture, the ever growing, ominous threat. a threat so horrific, so dreadful that many of the characters, didn't see, refused to see or simply dismissed it and this would ultimately be their downfall. this threat was not a mindless zombie horde, with no goal nor reason, it was the apocalypse. an event so terrible that no matter what had happened prior, no matter how rich, poor, cruel, kind, noble or dreadful they were, their world was doomed.game of thrones had one of the greatest platforms of all to get this message across. the night king should have been allowed to sweep them all aside. whether they were heroes or villains, it should have made no difference because the message was simple, do something before it is too late. and it was too late !!this show had everything, great settings, great actors and actresses, it even had dragons. more importantly it had the greatest threat we will ever face, us and our inability to recognise and act upon the real threat. instead the writers of season eight decided to turn this messenger into a stereotype villain, made of ice who could easily be dispatched by a teenage girl with a knife. girl power, wins the day !!game of thrones could have gone out with a huge bang, the message could easily have been put out through far better writing and following where the original storyline was actually heading. eight seasons and nearly ten years in the making and they simply missed the point to it all."
2014-04-11,lssking,"Pure escapism, but one that drags",2,"i mainly watch got because i like peter dinklage , he's clearly brilliant. the show is very well-produced but it does drag. i always multi-task while watching because the plot is repetitive. there are also numerous two-dimensional characters where you just chuckle when they get decapitated or hump each other or whatever. a lot of the actors carry flat, wooden faces throughout their entire on screen existence (including the girl with the dragons). having posted that, the dragons are indeed cool. so i guess i'm just another fantasy nerd like everyone else who watches this show. game of thrones is not 100% compelling and it's hard to believe anyone would watch an episode more than once, unless for clarification"
2017-11-04,metallicage,This is the show I want to 'preserve' with blue eyes !,10,"to be honest ..out of all the tv series i watched, my brain and heart never felt anything about it while watching this show. emotions go so high and goosebumps catches me so often that i have thought several times to be a part of it, no matter if only for 5 min!from the first episode to the last of season 7, it has been a remarkably well directed, edited and performed tv series! from blue eyes of the dead to the cold snowy effects, from flying dragons to a touch of blade, from knights and lords and witches and castles and .. ah there is just so much in it that it gets on the nerves very easily but wont get off so quietly !all i can say that all of the actors deserve a lot of applaud for their stunning performances and the visual effects are at the very best !keep up the superb work as it will come to an end after,all but i am glad that i will have all of it saved and i will watch it from the beginning like a treat .. yes i will watch it like 3 episodes in a row in one sitting :pthat would be fun ! this 7th season .. its getting into me like a drug .. and i think i am addicted to the screams of dragons and the looks of the queen ! i cannot wait to watch the wall and listen to the best of the written dialogues in the present century for a tale that never existed ! its like it has no flaws at all .. no error ! everything is happening on its right time, every time the dragons appear its like ohhhh yeahhhh bring it on !!! and its sad that the end is near.i have hundreds of ideas for the producers to keep this show running but may be its better to finish it off to make a history here for english tv serials !!"
2020-03-09,legbreaker,Would have been...the best show ever..,10,"but.. season 8 ruined it. i think the writers got bored. but man..... despite the last season, this was a true masterpiece, i understand why this was hyped while i ignored this show when it was broadcasted. i started watching got a week ago and just finished it yesterday. got im gonna miss it.."
2020-11-16,cassan2184,Believe the hype!,10,"i give this 10 out of 10 even after taking the weaker last two seasons into account. that is how amazing this show is.i have a burning envy of anyone who hasn't watched this yet and will have the chance to binge it all. you are in for the most spectacular tv show that has ever been made. the actors are superb, costumes and sets transport you to another world and the story is truly epic.it is part fantasy but if you think that rules you out then think again. the political intrigue and family dynamics woven through this series make it worth watching in their own right.i can see why people may be put off by the 'hype' but there is a reason why millions if not billions have loved this show, so get comfy and find out why.enjoy!!"
2021-05-30,itsasecretm,Excellent villains and casting choices,1,strongly recommend to watch this show. the casting choices were superb. the entirety of the show had the best villains to encounter the screen. if you like a show were you never know what will happen in the next episode please watch this series.

2014-09-06,wertogg,Tyrion!!!,6,"this show is so awesome. props to the directors staying true to their way. i just finished watching the 4th season and spoiler: i cant believe he killed his dad i sooooo hope he's not dead, that's not a just end to him. his dad needs to suffffffer alive i soooo hope he's not dead.tyrion is my fav. i can't wait to see the jon snow start winning (with his yonger bros) but tyrions dad needs to be there so they can defeat him and make him suffer.i read the news after watching stuff and i cant believe the crap i read, bunch of women, and some men who are just woman disguised as men, complaining that vaginas were waxed and its not true to the time. of all things that can be truer to the time they pick vaginas? and what time had magic dragons and beasts? come on. and they complained about the rape my goodness gracious. first of all not rape. second of all its a show, if you can't deal with this stuff emotionally don't watch it, simple.and the male castration/mutilation/violence is so much more. i mean the castration of weak was elaborated on over episodes it is sooo much. and after watching all that they complain the women are mistreated. it's a show and it's war the audience knows this and we enjoy the show.anyways props to the directors to staying true to their stuff and not swaying for these losers.anyways... so sad viper died :( realllly realllly loved his fighitng style."
2019-06-04,systemerror1986,Great Show! Fantastic Characters,9,"i just recently watched the entire show from season 1 to season 8 without having watched any episode before that or reading the book, yet i loved it.i'm not that fanboy as many of the other reviewers here could say from them, but i really enjoyed that dark, intelligent tone, the love for so much detail and the storyline from the start with all those houses and families involved and battling in such a complex yet somehow familiar world. i even found season 8 interesting despite it's pointed out as the worst of all. of course even i (no,""fanboy"") can understand that the first seasons are written and brought on screen in a much more professional and more complex way (book) than the last 2 or 3 seasons, but i find it incredibly unfair to rate the entire show (thousands of people working on set, behind the cameras, actors/actresses, people creating all those textiles, cgi effects, set-workers, and so on...) with a 1 out of 10 or a 3 out of 10 as they are and were those who made the show most of you first loved so much a tv show. it's sad that all their efforts and hard work over the last decade! has been judged in minutes by disappointed (for their reasons) fans because some writers choose to ""give their own touch"" to the original.our world, for me, was always very close to what the seven kingdoms are so i'm not surprised by that, many would probably scream for beheading if that was an option but i still will recommend to everyone who hasn't read the book to watch the series even if you're not a fan of sword fights, dragons, and ""badass""-queens, you most likely will not regret it."
2019-05-21,dimospaek,Simple questions never answered,10,"spoiler questions ahead, things happened with no reason: 1) why jon snow had to die and reborn? really why? what was the purpose of jon living, they could defend without him. or of jon dying and reborn?
2) what was the purpose of the god of light? who is the god of light? how does he exist? how is it possible that a god exist, gives power to a witch and reborns people or doing so many things? and why he didn't want the night king?
3) and who was the night king? why he wanted to attack? how did he born? how did he talk with others another language? where he was and why he was waiting 8 seasons or more ages to attack?
4) what was the purpose of melisandre? why was her purpose to defend from the nightwalkers? and if so, why she did other things too, like what she did in season 3? and where is she from? how old is she? why she was part of the war at season 3 anyway ?
5) what was the purpose of bran? really now, he just gets in animals, and knows some things. he didn't do anything. if he just had to give a knife to arya then this is ridiculous. 8 seasons trying to make him something just for a knife?
6) what was the role of sam? what was it? to cure jorah? he didnt do anything finally.awesome storyline, tv show is a disaster. so many things could have done to make these series hilarious and you just destroyed it.
you were building characters 8 seasons just for this end?"

2019-05-20,ankaronline,Greatness that didn't hold,10,"this series is, without a doubt, one of the greatest in the television history. i'm once again grateful that i could watch and be a part (as a viewer) of something like 'game of thrones'. it showed so much wit, grandeur and skill that one can't possibly deny its merits.just for the record, there are two episodes that deserve 10 out of 10, in my opinion. they are 'the children' and 'battle of the bastards'.holding the bar consistently high, however, is a great feat, and as much as i rooted for the show to do this and not get drowned in its own success and glory, i couldn't help but realize that this is exactly what happened.after pulling off exceptional six seasons, i wouldn't mind them taking a couple of years off and waiting for mr. martin to finish his books. we had a horrendous 17,month long hiatus before the final season anyway. but nstead, we have what we have...i won't list all the deficiencies the series was embellished with throughout its final seasons, except for the ending. just imagine that at the end of 'the lord of the rings', after all the storylines, character developments, battles and pathways it was gandalf, not aragorn, who was crowned in minas tirith."
2019-06-14,deemarie-63041,Ending made me want back all my wasted time,3,"don't invest any time or money into this, the ending is trash in every aspect"
2020-02-07,mariaduvalzd,Marathon Junkie.,10,"i was mesmerized by this series but greatly disappointed with the last 2 seasons. when you're ending such a great series, at least you can go out with a bang. season 8 was rushed in my opinion, writers and directors were slackers, their heart wasn't in it. i think i'll stick with reading novels hope this doesnt happen with the witcher. only time will tell."
2018-09-25,royshaelendra,Best show ever..,10,"what can i say..it's the best tv show that i've ever seen. the plot, the characters, the settings, the dialogues..everything is top notch. the gory and nude scenes are well crafted. overall it's an amazing experience. some people said the last couple of seasons are a bit dissapointing. i beg to differ. season 6 has 2 of the best episodes in battle of the bastards and winds of winter. season 7 is amazing with all the reunions of the stark kids, first encounter of the main casts and the incredible war scenes. it's gonna be really hard to top this show..and i'm lookin forward to the final season.."
2019-12-27,kelseymichele-88274,show of the decade,10,"still the best show on tv. season 8 is better than both 2 & 5. watch for yourself and judge instead of making a decision before watching. the character development was there, the audience just chose to ignore a lot of it. also, several months after the finale, people are still asking questions to things that have been answered. don't wanna rewatch it bc you don't want to come to the realization that you missed all the clues? that's cool, i get it. season 8 felt more like got than season 7. i have very few complaints about the last season and they are pretty minor (lack of dialogue from cersei & varys, jon allowing ghost to be where he is during the long night, and then of course a certain surprise at dragonstone, things like that.) season 6 is the best season, for all the information we get. the entire series is still the best thing i have seen on television. mostly just pleased that anyone wanted to work on a fantasy show at all and you can't really expect the actors to spend 5+ more years on it when for many of the characters left, this is the first thing these actors have done. also, and this is coming from a book reader, i feel like i'm the only person who does not care about the others/nk. i was looking forward to the new show, considering it said it wasn't the story we thought we knew, but now that it's off the table, i'm over it. book readers will know that the others in the books are different from the show, especially with the addition of nk, so we got what we got in the show and we will get what we get in the books. as for other characters... if you didn't see it coming then i don't really know what to tell you. sorry."
2020-03-01,kelseymichele-88274,seasons 2 & 5,10,"are the worst seasons. sad that so many people follow the little herd. were we all even watching the same show? i'm not sure, if you really think season 5 is better than 6, 7, or 8. as a reader, they made obvious changes from the beginning of the show and (for the most part) made the narrative work. if you think the books will have such a different ending, im sorry, but the seeds were planted a long time ago. you will just get to see many more characters' journeys unfolding individually as opposed to merging multiple characters' stories, like they had to do in the show.
although 2 & 5 are my least favorite seasons (especially 5, honestly) i will continue to rewatch this show as many times as i can, as well as reread the series as many times as i can. it may be similar to other fantasies, but there is also something quite different about it. for me, it will last through the ages.
p.s. stop filming yourselves watching tv with all the lights on and turn your brightness up and you may be able to see what's happening at night in westeros... just a thought."
2020-03-18,thomaspford,All Good Things Must Come to an End,10,"no show has ever captivated me like got did. the first season was a little hard for me to get through, but it doesn't take long for you to fall in love with the characters and their complexity. great acting across the board, stunning visuals and cinematography, and ramin djawadi provides some of the best soundtrack material i've ever come across. but.... there's a clear drop off once the writers out paced the books. no show out there can top seasons 1,6 of got. but the last season in particular all but ruined the series for me. the writers failed pretty much every character, rendering a show i once considered the greatest of all time unwatchable."
2019-06-05,vladalexa-57122,Everybody should give it a try,10,"you probably saw lots of spoilers all over the internet, and you probably have heard the last two seasons are sooooo bad. you probably already know who dies, who survives and who will sit on the throne. even if the last two seasons are kinda bad, they're still better than most of the stuff that comes out everyday. do yourself a favor a watch it, because got is all about the journey in its amazing word. p.s: my mother is a 45 years old fashion woman and never really like tv series or understand our generation culture. yesterday she decided to give it a chance, now she's already in s02e05"
2019-05-20,noss-58443,The best,8,best tv show ever . after the 8th season. fhat was actually a fantastic story
2018-07-31,littlewitham,Not my kinda thing.. but omg.,10,i did not want to love this show!!!!!!! but here i am in the imdb reviews section proclaming to the world that i am in love with john snow.. ugh... i mean got... hehe. great story telling & wonderful sets. i love it so much.
2021-05-16,s-t-a-t-i-x,Arguably the best tv show ever until it wasn't,10,"the first four seasons of game of thrones are probably the best tv i have ever seen. everything just felt right. the plot, the storylines, the characters, the unpredictable plot twists, the tension, the excitement, the genuine emotion you felt during some of the worst fates for characters or finally seeing something happen you've been dying to see.during seasons five and especially six it became quite clear that the creators were struggling with the lack of source material as the book series wasn't finished yet. i think episode 10 of season 6 is the best episode this tv show has to offer. it's also the last episode game of thrones was game of thrones. it's quality had already started to decline, but nothing could've prepared us for what came next.seasons 7 and more so season 8 were atrocious. due to the absence of source material and the inability of the creators to craft their own story, they reduced the episode orders for each season to 7 and 6 episodes respectively. seasons 7 and 8 spat on everything that came before it. instead of intelligent characters and clever storytelling, we got two seasons filled with characters doing a 180 on their development and an overabundance of clichés. nothing made sense anymore. it was as if the tv show was handed over two people that didn't understand anything about what they'd created.and that's the revelation. david beniof and d. b. weiss never knew what the hell they were doing. they didn't create game of thrones, george rr martin did. sure, they excelled at adapting source material, but without it, they're some of the worst storytellers out there. hbo wanted more seasons, hbo wanted to give them more money, but they were looking at their next big payday. they betrayed all fans of game of thrones. what could've gone down in history as of the greatest tv shows of all time, was no more. nowadays, nobody wants to talk about game of thrones anymore.do yourself a favor: watch the first six seasons and then tell yourself that's it.gave it a 9 because of what it once was."
2019-05-21,t-u-r-k-i-23085,My favorite show ever,10,"one of the best tv shows i have ever seen .i'm so happy, i see this amazing showthe final season it was ok not like the previous seasons but still i love this show the end it was very sad but not bad.it was ok."
2019-05-20,wildrockiesdude,A New Era of Tv Shows <3,10,"this serial made me love high fantasy , so lucky that i startet watching it in early 2016"
2020-04-10,shrustidoshi-95042,It's good till season 7,9,the entire series till season 7 was excellent but in the 8th season it was not a good ending also the things got unrealistic
2021-04-09,tmwydlay,"Overrated, dry, and repetitive.",8,"this show is nudity and shock factor laced into lord of the rings. i know that sounds like an extremely shallow take on the show but i'm not exaggerating.it's decent, there's some great action and very likeable characters with stellar development. where the show really falls short is just when you start to see the big picture, it changes again. when you just start to like someone, they're dead or disappear from the show for a long time. when you think they're not going to do much more random awkward nude scenes, they do another one.it's just over and over intense in so many of the wrong ways and not just the story itself. this is the classic hbo syndrome that drives eyes to tv screens but sometimes ultimately lacks substance. this show is no exception. not only that, but this show did push the envelope a bit too much with some extremely graphic violence and subject matter. a newborn baby being eaten alive by wild dogs? i have a strong stomach but that's not really something anyone wants to see, off screen or not. did make waiting for ramsay's death that much more satisfying though, everyone agrees.if writers focused more on the story and not the filler, this could have been one of the best shows of all time. a lot of people will see this is one of the best in recent times but i doubt they would feel the same without all the mindless gore and full frontal nudity throughout."
2019-05-22,tct65,To Keep It Short,7,"s1 , s5 = absolute masterpiece, best show ever s6 = top tier, but a little slow and raggedy
s7 = overall below average season, writing starts to go downhill, but i have seen worse
s8 = absolute disaster, too many plot holes, and a rushed finalefor the last two seasons, they should've given us all 10 episodes to play everything out. or should have just given us another season. character arcs were a bit rushed and too many questions in the end. hated seeing one of my favorite shows go down in flames."
2020-04-24,memodurans,"These series deserve a 7, because of the ending",8,"you are wasting your time watching this serie, because the whole point of it is the narrating, boling suspense towards the end, ""winter is coming"".... well that breeze was a stupid wait.... and the throne was a bland, dull, boring and stupid game."
2020-04-10,arindamdas-41892,The greatest television show in the history of television series making....,10,"one of the finest show i've ever laid my eyes on, no other show comes close to the level of got in the history of television series making, except for maybe breaking bad & the wire. the show starts like a gem, with excellent pacing, amazing plot, brilliant characters, right from the very first episode you get hooked and then get ready for a heartbreak (ned's death, not a spoiler!) season 1,6 100/10. then season 7, good but a little rushed and not of got's standards, then comes a little disappointment, the ruined ending. everything is so so great about this show, you'll love it and keep loving it, will always keep you at the edge of your seat, then you'll feel they did a mistake with the ending. a perfect show & the highest rated one before the rushed ending. this is one of those shows everyone should watch before you die. i'm writing this review after finishing it, give it a shot. it's better than any other show you've previously watched and will always be. 💜❤"
2019-05-14,gunayrusul,Don't underrate a great eqisode just because you feel bad about one character,10,this captivating saga has been underrated only because dayneris has large army of fans who were not satisfied with her turning into madness especially without previous development but that doesn't change the fact that the episode is perfecyt in all its aspects espicially its matching to the vision dayneris saw in s02 e10
2019-05-14,gunayrusul,The vision in Season 2 episode 10 45:00 - 47:00,6,"the vision became reality! though it was written 15 years ago but the writer was so consistent that he didn't change the end at all, dany was meant to become like this from the beginning."
2019-05-11,jtalks,"Ugh, to all the 1/10ers",10,you all need to realize that the final season doesn't define an entire show. the first seven season have been phenomenal pieces of art.
2021-04-25,fezzehkarami,Great stories aren't gonig to end well always,10,"this is show that stabs it's characters as mercilessly as it stabs it's audience; i couldn't expect less.i really wanted to believe that every character was treated gently as the others, in my opinion every character was treated well even john snow but if you destroy a character's arc it's a sin that the audiences will never forgive the show runners for it.how can we forget that this show destroyed daenerys targaryen's character arc in the final two episodes.well after seven and a half great season i can say that the greatest show ever was needlessly spoiled in the last two episodes."
2019-02-19,thenay-75272,YES.,6,okay so i never thought i would like this show. i always heard stuff about it and i would be like it cant be that good get away from me nerd but during my break i had no thing to watch so i was like why not. so i watched it andddddd omg its so freakin good like i never thought i would be a game of thrones fan but here i am reading 300 something pieces of trivia on imdb like it's keeps you hooked from the first episode which is really hard to do. it's sooo good.you need to give it a try don't judge it by stuff you heard cause it so much better than that. you guys seriously need to watch it. give it a chance cause it will shake you to the core
2021-10-04,petrerotileanu,Best series ever,7,"the first 4 seasons of got are the best thing you can find on television. 5,6 are ok and you can't complain that much but it isn't that good as the first seasons but 7 and 8 are a total garbage in my opinion. i will rate 10 because of the 4 seasons that just are the best thing ever so please watch it the actors are incredibile and everything is good about this show except the last seasons."
2020-07-30,safwanmujawar,Best fantasy drama series ever made,6,"game of thrones if just perfect series for web series lovers which has many happy, sad , emotional, unexpected, wow moments .got is perfect adaptation of rr martin novels series . game of thrones includes the perfect direction , screenplay , cast selection , locations , beautiful castles and landmarks , story writing , acting of every cast members , vfx , dragons , white walkers , politics , action , huge battles . yeah i'm not kidding got has it all so please go and watch this awesome drama. suspence is big reason that i love about this series, after every season ending episode you'll get big suspence.special effects in got used in such way that they all look so real.there are many iconic dialogues used throughout the series those you'll remember for your lifetime. some dialogues you'll remember forever "" chaos is ladder ""
"" it doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else "" ."" any man who must say, ""i am the king"", is no true king ""
while watching you'll get emotionally attached to characters , got is my all time favourite series .i know people are critising the whole series based on last 2,3 episodes , i know it hurts so bad as a fan , but its like life ""we don't get perfect ending all the time "" . but real story isn'tending here because rr martin is writing his 6th and last 7th novel of series a song of ice & fire . and we all got fans are waiting for how rr martin will end his novels .i've watched this show 4 times till now & can't wait to watch it 5th time.... so i'll recommend this series to everyone. valar moghulis."

2019-05-22,millehjgard,"Last season not great, sooooo disappointed",9,"i agree with others that this show would have grotten a 10/10 if the last season did not exist.... ii seamed like they did not want to make it...
the thing all was wanting for... done in episode 3 (that was so dark you could not see anything)
and last episode boring....
really really disappointed....."
2021-07-05,laurianne_dm,Top show in my opinion,10,"this show is by far one of my top favorite show, until the last season that is. the last season was poorly written and rushed. the characters that were masterminds suddenly became sloppy and making stupid decisions that ended in their deaths. i still give a 10 because 1 season out of 8 that was bad, the overall series was incredible."
2018-11-12,vaishnavcreationz,RIP to my nails nothing remains....,10,"i waited for every episodes, every twist & turns this series may cheat us because you couldn't guess what is next"
2019-05-22,l-68161,Disappointing final 3 episodes,7,"my favourite tv show ever, ruined by the last 3 episodes in season 8. most of the characters this show carefully crafted and built up over the previous season all had pointless endings. and how slow was that final episode? talk about anti,climax!"
2020-07-09,upadhyaysamrat,Best creation of entertainment industry by humans it is masterpiece,10,"got is not a common show a it's emotion of billions of people living across the globe after watching this series i know why it is on guinees book of record why it's world's no one series every made it has set standards and bar so high that others can't compete it's story, plot development , cgi ,vfx grand sets, brilliant acting everything thing is just super perfect you can't get the series every out of our head and i feel pity and soory for those who never watched this masterpiece ......it want sequel to series and danereys targaryean our queen (emila clarke )should be there and this time full justice and more power to her chracter"
2021-10-10,ranjitpowerpower,Worth watching except one thing,6,"very nice series. you would feel addicted. but one thing was worst in it.whole season they repeatedly warned ""winter is coming"" which represented the war with bad creatures and the war just ended like it was nothing to be warned about."
2021-06-03,acec-29548,Not good at all,4,"to be fair i only watched the first three seasons. it was rated so highly i felt i must be missing something. i wasn't. it is just bad cinema. not horrible, just not interesting. i think many of the characters are terribly miscast. they are not believable and the plot is thin. and there are no distinguishable good guys and bad guys. so far they are all bad. i'm not sure how it ends, i'm just glad it is over for me. if you want to watch a similar theme that is excellent try ""the last kingdom""."
2019-05-16,saudiqxn,Amazing show,10,i like this show because there is too many people inside this show and i like the story of the show

2019-03-08,termsemgamer,The End is Coming,10,one of the best shows ever is going to end soon. season 8 is coming and the question is who will finally sit on the iron throne... hbo made a very good trailer with no spoilers but left us with many questions.
2019-05-06,ahmadrahimkhan,Last season ruined everything they had built on!,8,"bran will become the next nk because he had a mark on his arm left by night king? cliched and ruined
downhill"
2019-07-30,cdgrech,Fantastic until S07 & 08 happens,9,"i absolutely lived game of thrones. it was looking to be the greatest television series i'd ever enjoyed. that is until season 7 happened, where cracks in the plot & rushed story telling begun. then season 8 happened & it all fell to pieces.
it was like watching your favorite football team winning all the way through a championship final match by a huge margin only to somehow throw the lead away in the last ten minutes and lose by a few points.
very disappointed in what the show runners did with something that was shaping up to be great."
2020-09-11,kresho-12906,When the last step is step back.,10,"while following the books it was a great show. when it came to the end of the story fromthe books , desaster... most disapointing ending i have ever seen"
2019-04-13,el_critic,A gory soap opera,7,"firstly, i used to be an avid fan of got (s1,s3). but i've now had to downgrade this series to soap opera status.killing off main characters was interesting initially, because it drove the plot (somewhat). now it just seems like a deliberate gesture to make a point to all the fans. by the fourth season you become so desensitised to someone dying that you end up feeling like cersei (a psychopath).this show is hanging on a single thread; the ""who's going to die next"" thread. it would've been fine if it was a spin-off of the hunger games.with the hype surrounding the final season, i just thought that it'd be fair to warn those who haven't seen a single episode and are planning to. don't. just read the synopsises and you'll probably have more story than the people who've watched the show from start to finish.the 6/10 rating is mostly for the first 3 seasons and the decent cgi."
2019-05-20,lucasd-12944,Best show ever,7,overall this show is amazing. it has some sketchy parts but it also has some of the best moments in tv history. season 1 is probably the worst season as it is just setting up different characters and their locations for seasons to come but it is still great. after season 1 the show gets better and better and better but then at season 8 it dies down a little bit but it is still one of the greatest seasons of tv history.
2019-05-20,sorena_a,Over:(,10,the way they chose the king was so chaldish. the rest was quiet good. but hard to believe that there is no got left😔

2019-05-28,mgs-15317,Best serie ever but for the last season,10,terrible last season. it is such a pitty that they decided to hurry the last season. i wish i never saw it. it was such a disappointing experience. it doesn't make sense. after so many wonderful seasons! i have to give a 10 to all seasons except season 8. i will give it a minus 10
2019-06-11,rob-74582,Short and Sweet,10,"i'll make this short and sweet. i just finished watching all 8 seasons and would rate this series the best of any i've seen. for people to say they were disappointed with season 8 makes me wonder. is it because not all the characters ended with a happy ending? to me, that made the series just that much better. if you haven't seen this series do as i did and watch all eight seasons over a period of a couple of weeks. there is so much going on that to wait a week between each episode would make it hard to keep track of all that's going on."

you will badly miss some of the characters after you binged this series(uh i'm sure,actually,you gonna binge it).tyrion lannister,i tell you this,will remain as one of the best roles forever. the conspiracies,the rational thinking on how to attack and cease the iron throne. a treat to watch. you are gonna watch it.promise me!"
2021-03-20,barathbalaji-57000,Masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥,10,one of the best tv show with amazing story. but the writers could have improved with aegon targareyan's(jon snow) character. and could have elaborated about the night's king history.. until the 8th season 3rd episode most of them believed the night king played a major role in series but after the 3rd episode the night king was just a cameo. but yeah.... it's a must watch
2020-05-01,adeep-10048,All time top teir show,10,"this show is definitely a top 10 all time show. i won't give any spoilers but some were displeased with the ending. i honestly don't think its warranted, it seemed like internet bandwagon mentality more than actual opinion. on the opposite end i think most people found the first season to be a bit uneventful and i did feel the same but i assure you it gets a lot better and that part is part of the set up."
2020-05-15,dhruvesh-71664,Iconic start with an upsetting ending,3,"the show start at 30,000 feet and continues to be the same until 4th season. 5th onwards they started moving away from the books and became like any regular show. they hit rockbottom in seasons 7 & 8. didn't expect it."
2020-07-13,rashed_sayem,We're lucky to be born in the time of GOT,10,"got is a lifetime experience which you can feel but can't express in words. still, i will try to express it. while watching it, i felt like i am living in the series. like, every events and characters communicate with me. all the credit to the creators, that they made a fantasy series so much credible and acceptable. the beauty of got is, it's divide an rule policy. it compels each individual to have a different perception and opinion. like, somebody hates cersei, but somebody else justifies all her deeds. it makes to dream, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it gives you hope, it breaks your hope.the casting is like, each and everyone is made for their role. the story is grabbing and the cinematography is incredible. not to mention the graphics. overall an lifetime experience. it's the single most exciting tv that gives adrenaline rush time and again. last but not least, got seems like an untold chapter of history while it's just a fantasy."

2020-07-03,fifaluck-47674,One of the best shows ever,3,"everyone has to watch , the story is amazing , the show is great and the characters are wonderful"
2020-09-12,crimsonstar94,CRIPS FOR THE THRONE,8,i thought the show did a good job highlighting the fact that people with disabilities can be meaningful in life. in most shows people with disabilities are shown as pitiful bystanders. it was nice to see them be more impactful in this universe.
2020-09-16,ess-96679,It's hard to sum up everything here...,7,"well well well... for all those hoping this to be another fantasy show, hey folks! it's nothing like that. once you begin watching this you'll grow a certain affinity towards the characters as they build themselves up. and mind you, got is an emotion. the storyline has dark tales and brutal twists up its sleeve. and especially the theme song🎶 wow. so if by any chance you are missing this, then pal go for it now!"
2021-05-18,pauljosephwatson,I loved it until I didn't.,9,"if this show ended good, and my goodness did it fail the audience, then i would give it a solid 10. because of season 8, i can only give it an 8.the main problem (in my frankly rather educated opinion) is that they dragged it on too long.far too long. far, faaaaar too long.the compendium that it derives from, a song of ice & fire, is rather complex.but the show itself concerns a power struggle between two families whilst an unknown force is coming from ""the north"" and another unexpected from ""the south"". that's it, in a nutshell.there's lots of needless side,lining, very little history & development to the characters and sadly the acting isn't great, though there are some very adaptable and well-known actors who helm the metaphorical ship to keep it afloat.negativity over, i must highly congratulation and commend all those involved in the production.for the first time we had a fully fleshed-out fantasy world that people could relate to. usually fantasy worlds are highly detached and can only be appreciated by fans and geeks.but in this, you can truly feel the humanistic nature and struggle of all, good and bad. with the starks being the benevolent rulers and the lannister's being the cruel ones.then just to add a cherry on top the targaryen's - who are spoken only mythically among the current ruling houses reappear in the visage of daenerys who starts off benevolent but end up being cruel. with the ultimate weapon.power corrupts is the overall message.not deep, but it's not intended for a deep audience.one last thing: if they remade the last season, even in animation, that might patch up the animosity and disappointment that the hardcore fans have.for me though... yeah, i loved it - until i didn't."
2020-07-29,spacemonkey907,Could of been great...,9,"great, masterful show... until the last 3 seasons. writing got undeniable sloppy and the show was rushed. unfortunate terrible end to what could have been a almost perfect show."
2021-04-07,llauravuorii,Interesting plot and characters but a terrible ending,8,game of thrones has a very interesting plot and many interesting characters. the show only seems to get better and better but the final season is very disappointing. i'm not a big fan of fantasy shows but i still liked this one in general! 8/10.
2016-04-05,osonanx,Don't listen to the bad reviews. Watch a few episodes and see for yourself.,7,"i rate this 10 because the storyline is amazing. there is no show like this one, most other shows sucks so much in comparison. good dialogue,balanced with action, drama, comedy, thrilling. the only negative thing i would say that the show has too few episodes each season i wish there was more. ^^i must laugh of those who say the show is predictable, they either read the book or they are full of bull. the show takes you on an amazing ride. some says it's boring? why because there actually is happening things all the time if one pays attention.make up your own mind, watch a few episodes, and see if this is too your likening. ^^ enjoy to everyone who is awaiting season 6. ^^"
2021-09-03,alanpiaskowski,Awful ending,9,"one of the best series at the beggining gest worse after 6th seasons in 8th season its just awful, but still 10 stars for that great time it given me when watching for the first time."
2019-05-09,mail-shadow,D&D ran out of Book material and it took 1 and 1/2 seasons to show everyone,10,"first of all, i watched the 1st season, then i read all the books till season 2 came out and then i just watched the show since no new book (waiting for the 6th) came out.this was one of my favorite shows of all time, largely because the source material is great and this is not one of those hollywood stories. people don't have ""plot armor"", main characters die and u get surprised when fan favorites get killed because the plot just makes more sense that way.a death is meaningful, grrm always said that a good story has to do that. another great aspect are fledged out characters who are not just black and white. for example jaymie lannister, first people think he is such a douche, but as the story progresses you see his inner motivation and that he is above all else a human being with a motivation like the rest of us (things i do for love)i was hopeful they would continue this show after the ran out of source material because some of the scenes which diverted from the book were really awesome (e.g. arya and tywin scenes in harrenhal, in the books they don't meet but arya interacts with r. bolton at harrenhal) , so i thought d&d could do good dialogue and some original writing.but boy ..... was i wrongi still enjoyed season 6 allthough some people already said it was showing that they ran out of book material, yes they did simplify a large chunk of the story but all in all, it was good writing and the scaling and logic of the universe still made sense aswell as the actions of the characters.but then season 7 came and they through logic out of the window, and i don't mean that in the sense that this is fantasy, but the ""logic of the universe"" was crushed. it felt like time travel and stupid decision making the whole season long. season 8 so far turned this up a notch and made me cringe like every 5 minutes.what a sad ending for such a great start."
2020-07-23,seraphin-5,Wonderful show overall! But the last season has its flaws.,9,"i won't repeat all those reviews which praise the first 7 seasons. they are all correct.and along came season 8 of got and this season has its let,downs.
examples, please?
well, just hints here in order to aviod spoilers...where do you never ever hide away from an enemy who is capable of raising the dead?if a beloved character turns evil there should be a really good reason for this to happen. series 8 does not deliver this reason which is a shame because it would not have been difficult to do and one solution in my mind would only require maybe 5 minutes screen time.but these faults can be forgiven if you look at the gorgeous story and the beautiful writing and production that is present in almost all episodes.and yes, i do like the ending very much. everone who has been past season 1 of game of thrones must be prepared to witness harsh fates of beloved characters - minor or major ones alike."
2019-07-30,akkrock,It is the best,10,"last season pretty f,cked up whole series but this series deserves watching again and again. great acting, costumes, atmosphere, story... cant argue with that why this is the most expensive one."
2020-05-16,matchu73,Close...yet so far away....,10,"this was to be the greatest tv show in history. when the show had the books source material it was utterly incredible. we were totally hooked on it and happily rewatched episodes and series. then the source material ran out....thing were still very good, but season 7 showed a noticeable drop in writing quality.then season 8 hit. wow....what an unholy mess ! it made it clear that the writers (and i use the term loosely) were utterly out of their depths without the source material. worse still as d&d had offers of jobs with huge contracts elsewhere (star wars.....but they were removed from this before they started, possible because of the mess they made on got) they rushed to get season 8 done asap....and boy does it show....this was an amazing show....but season 8 killed it and destroyed its viability for repeat watching for me and many others. what a waste...."
2012-04-03,blanknamedstuff,Surprisingly good,9,"this series is definitely a fantasy piece. the locales are outstanding, there are knightly games and battles, and the costumes are what you'd expect for a dark ages period story.but don't let any of that lull you into a sense that you'll be seeing a ""lord of the rings"" copy cat. game of thrones is a political intrigue story about several houses (clans, family groups) and their struggle for dominance. the story is very engaging and quite well scripted. it is very easy to imagine something like this had actually happened in history.the acting is standard for the genre. expect to hear generic english accents from most of the cast, although the story specific language is spoken very well. it sounds like a mix of elvish and arabic; the actors must have practiced it a lot. there are a few moments where the acting is stiff or forced but all in all it's good.it should be noted that this is an hbo original series, and like other series from hbo and showtime you can expect the cookie,cutter formula for ""risky and shocking"". what it amounts to is an abundance of nudity (male and female) and strong language (f-bombs) that isn't actually necessary. in several places it actually slows the progression as the episode stops for a moment to allow naked people to randomly pop into the scene. if full frontal nudity is a major turn off for you then you will not enjoy the series as it pervades every episode.the only complaint i have is that it seems like something has been left out, most likely for timing. there are a few minor arcs that are introduced and then disappear for quite a while, only to jump back in at an odd time. for example: in the first episode there is a lot of emphasis put on the dire wolves. they get a bit of screen time in the first two episodes then disappear except for parts where it's necessary to move the story forward. i know i'm supposed to care about the critters as much as the characters (apparently) do, but they don't get enough screen time to be more than furry props.still, this is a very good series. i'd recommend it to anyone who can stomach hbo shows."
2021-04-01,sf_nicole,Worst Ending Ever,10,"this was a 9.5 up until the 2nd to the last season, and then it started to decline. but the worst part of this was the ending. never before have i seen a franchise napalm their syndication potential like got did. we use to watch this over and over until the last season and now it is like, why would you want to watch it again when they could not come up with a descent ending?"
2019-11-15,diaphanous19,9/10 all the way until the last season,10,"this show was brilliant from the first season till the penultimate season..the last season was shit, especially the last few episodes. pure shit. it felt super rushed, with so many scenes and questions going unanswered. no heart or thought was put into the last few episodes, it really felt like they just wanted to end it as soon as possible. they tried to throw in some nonsensical shit to try to end it in a wonderful fashion, but failed spectacularly. the last season ruined everything for me, and was so bad that i have to change my rating from 9/10 to 1/10 overall. fuck this series."
2012-07-30,whitewolfcx,Salute to the writer!,10,"never seen such a plot. everything is here. all the things forbidden by religions of the world, which were actually present in the past. if you are taking it seriously, then you would get to know what the writer wants to convey. the reality of humans! the show is about two clans, 1 in north and other in south. first season deals largely with north clan and there battles with themselves. main character is a lord, eddard stark, whose family lives in a cold region called winterfell. there is boundary in the city called as wall, outside which white walkers live, supernatural characters. king robert comes to meet stark and ask for his help and ask him to go with him to his land and set matters right. ultimately the kings wife gets all the bad work done and be the reason to start a war with the starks. if you want a show with no bullshit, grim reality of our kings and lots of honor filled characters, just watch it."
2020-04-27,jaspreetsinghtuteja,Masterpiece,1,just watch it 👍🏼 great show great dragons' and actors john snow the imp.
2020-04-10,whelan_jay,How do you end the greatest show of this generation?,10,"if the answer you want is 'you don't', then no matter what happens you will be disappointed. i don't diss or hate a show because it has the odd bad episode the same way i don't dump my girlfriend every time she annoys me. the complete series was a masterpiece and everybody should watch. people who don't appreciate that are the same people who give out about something you did that one time years ago."
2013-11-12,thanos999,This is not lord of the rings,10,"i consider myself as a man who doesn't watch tv series, i never did.on the other hand,i enjoy watching movies. some friends of mine told me about game of thrones.they compared this series with lord of the rings and when they did that...that was the final hit.i started watching the 1st season, i watched it all,every episode.someone could say that i was inspired or even more that i was amazed. no i wasn't, it was just the needing to know.i wanted to see what was going to happen.maybe this is the goal of the producers, maybe they don't care if you like it, they just want you to watch,to watch it all.if that is, they achieved it. but let me tell you this, this has nothing to do with lord of the rings. you are not going to see lord of the rings in a tv series version.i am not saying if this is good or bad, this depends on each one's preferences.all i am saying is that this is something completely different. here you can enjoy corruption,anti,heroism,back-stabs,murders,ultra- violence,naked ""sausages"" and bouncing ""melons"",if you know what i mean and most of all death.as for fantasy,battles,true heroes and...fantasy, this is not the right place to be.of course i don't believe that fantasy and battles is all that lord of the rings gives.on the opposite,lord of the rings, mostly as a book but as a film too,transfers very deep meanings. i want to add,as an answer to some reviews, that true heroes and true villains are not childish or superficial.the existence of the good and the evil symbolizes the human and his internal fight and dilemma.talking about lord of the rings,i think that its heroes are much more realistic than the ones in the game of thrones.every important character in lord of the rings confronts his/her bad and dark self,for example frodo and boromir did.but the target is to transfer the meaning of hope and love that's why finally comes the redemption of the characters.i didn't see this in game of thrones and i didn't like it. concluding,you could find some interesting things in game of thrones,one of them is the plot which will easily keep your eyes on the screen.have a good day."
2019-06-07,umairabdul1984,What have you done???,10,pathetic i repeat pathetic ending for such a great show. disappointed by season 8. shame! shame! shame!
2019-05-13,gway8282,Lost 2.0 but with an ending,10,"they got me again. take your time telling a amazing story and ruin it because you want to rush or don't have the ability to tell the story the right way. i waited 7 years for ""the long night"". so they decided to close that in one episode. now i have 2 episodes to watch and i don't care. they rushed every aspect of this show since the end of season 5. i honestly thought this show would be hands down the greatest show ever sindicated. but i guess i can still give that to sopranos or wire. gots had the makings to be the show you talked about for 20 years. instead it's going to become the new lost."
2019-05-05,feet_ontheground,The Writing Has Been WEAK for some time now. Season 8 writing is AWFUL!,10,"so, so ,much awful writing.. takes away from great cast and some great potential story... season 8 is no exception... basically crap writing.... is what we can expect from the game of thrones. lesson... don't create a series based on books and then try to write it yourselves after that... because you are not the writers and you will likely fall short.... not planning to engage any prequel or future stories from these guys because they have proven they can't deliver. and i came back to take away another star for the concerted effort of using cast to attack show fans. shame on you cast & all for attacking fans for having feelings about the truly badly written season 8. you don't hide people in a crypt when fighting a boss that raises the dead.. you don't use a line of dialogue from a character(jorah) to suddently make a character 'smart' that you have written into idiocy for many seasons.. your story telling in season 8 screams you did not care anymore d&d!"
2019-03-26,stecrowd-539-162223,Thank goodness we aren't all the same! (Make for dull world!),10,"i love how these very few reviewers?, snobs? contrarians?, all these folks want to impress, i guess, all the rest of us poor idiot, no taste, suckers, who happen to judge this might be the best t.v. gig since sopranos or the wire maybe. how can all the millions be just so bloody misguided? maybe those other guys are just having a bad year or 4. but, it's a wonder i can even feed myself, i just watched ""the door"" for the third full time getting ready for #8. i can't believe i keep going back to s.1, e.1 and get hooked in again to look for some more clues. ah well, i have fun explaining them to my 4,legged son. at least he stays entertained with me. (or maybe he's got me fooled, too!) shoot, with s.8 we gotta go back to the once a week torture. i'll try to stay busy. you guys that think my brain must be mush for likin' this stuff, don't worry too much about me. been thinking of checking in on walter and that puss pinkman again. p.s.- got truly is the best hbo, showtime, etc series ever. (even curb your enthusiasm!)"
2021-01-23,ledward2,Anticlimactic,10,"first six season: 9 stars. truly amazing on every front. season seven: 7 stars. still good but didn't live up to preceding seasons. final season: 3 stars. ruined it for me. i understand how some can give it a pass and focus instead on the good seasons. i can't. it's a debacle. and it's not as though i hold finales to a higher standard. for example, unlike most, i thoroughly enjoyed the finales of dexter and seinfeld. is it too much to ask that finales don't suck?"
2012-07-25,atn_iitd,"Fabulous, Awesome Mindblowing",9,"i am out of words for this series. this is the best that was ever made and i am saying that after i have watched almost all of the high rated sitcoms. i loved friends but nothing come close enough to this george r.r. martin masterpiece. it open your eyes and makes you realize the truth of kingdom era in almost any part of the world. the world is full of shrewd, mean politics, people filled with lust and twisted loves. it may sound cynical to few but in spite of being classified as a fiction, nothing can better depict the true human nature. i am loving this series so much that i started reading the novel from season 2 onwards and found that the book is even more intriguing than the series itself (as is the case with almost all of the great novels). still i can't wait for season 3 and watching what i read in the book on the screen."
2019-10-09,maria_cashat,From perfect to awfull,9,"season 1 to 4 perfect (10) season 5 and 6 excellent (9)
season 7 mediocre (6)
season 8 awfull (2)is very sad that the showrunners prefer for the last seasons to take out the coherence and logic in the script and include action scenes only with the purpose of impact the viewers, and they failed so bad.this show deserve better"
2019-12-06,mindimeyer80,Love this show.,10,every season except 7 and 8 were excellent. it's a real shame they rushed the last 2 seasons it's an insult to the amazing story that we all fell in love with
2019-01-29,bprn40,Life changing viewing!!,10,"unsure when it was recommended to me, but it is , the greatest film, show, experience, time, memory you will ever have"
2019-06-13,cubsat,Increasingly dumb,10,"d&d turned the characters into hypocrites and dumbos. where do i start? so, varys serves the realm like a diehard. allows the noblest child on earth, joffrey, to be the king at the cost of ned stark's head. and somehow dany doesn't feel like a potentially good ruler to him? is she worse than joffrey? bran stark was an even bigger letdown. the three eyed raven storyline was just for passing time. the night king, apparently the biggest villain,gets lesser screen time than even ramsey and dies a freakish death. he can see bran even while he was warging, he but couldn't see arya sneak up on him. tyrion and sam somehow lose their intellect over a course of a few seasons. arya became reluctant to use her faceless james bond skills. in fact, at the end of the show, only sansa appears to have come out having learnt something and with more intellect. all others come out dumber. and rest are dead to create shock value. and jon,dany's romance was colder than the shivering sea."
2018-05-21,gracjanski,from season 6 so much feminism,10,"i prefer to watch series in one piece. it is nice to see how seies are changing and mostly getting better after 1 or 2 years. thos was the case in got too. so i enjoyed the first seasons, especielly season 3 and 4 and maybe the 5th season also, i cant remember. season 6 was a annoying, because the roles of men were ridiculous and there were so many women ruling and deciding. the reason is obvious, politics decides movies also, not logic of a story. it is so easy to get rid of a female enemy in a middle age setting: a man doesnt even need a weapon. i dont know, if i will watch the 7th season, probably not."
2015-07-11,ak-863-498693,Breaking Bad's successor is here !!!,10,"only after a long time i have watched a series which has the level of awesomeness that breaking bad had. well, i don't like mythological films/series that much but i do have to say after watching this i have to rethink. this is one of those series which will have a great impact on you. only after much recommendation by my friends i went for this one. the casting, direction, acting, screenplay and action scenes are just top level. the best thing is that you can't just leave it after watching one episode, it will surely hook you up. my personal favourite is tyrion lannister , he is the next best thing to sherlock played by benedict cumberbatch . jon snow is awesome as is daenerys targerean. this is one series which you will remember for a long time. ( waiting eagerly for season 6 )."
2019-07-05,tataj-neva,One big no-no,1,i won't comment much because the show is so bad for me that i can't find the exact words how to describe my disappointment. and not just the ending but the entire show who started somewhat promising and after just a couple of episodes i was extremely baffled with the show's reviews. 9.4/10? it makes me laugh every single time. lame copy of lotr.
2019-05-22,plain_text,My rating was 8. I changed it to 5.,10,"season 8 ruined everything for me. what was once an entertaining show with solid writing and thrilling character arcs was reduced to nothing more than a hallmark,type fantasy flick where logic or continuity had no room. unfortunately, hbo took got's fans for granted and let two incompetent writers ruin the show completely. there's a petition calling for a remake of season 8. it has garnered a significant number of signatures. i don't think this is gonna happen though. the damage has been done. it's permanent and cannot be undone. we waited two years for this season. we anticipated greatness. i mean it's only six episodes. how hard can it be? you had plenty of time to produce something epic. but mediocrity and stupidity is all we got. shame!"
2019-07-14,judyhop,Wow!,10,"we were late coming to the ""game,"" but now are totally in! harsh, dark, beautifully filmed. character development and plot twists are unbelievably fantastic."
2019-07-23,judyhop,BriLLiant!,2,"we were prepared to hate the ending, but it all fit together brilliantly. the only change i would have made would have been a much more brutal end to cersei. also, we were hoping for one last behind the scenes recap. great job!"
2019-05-15,therock_q8,Game of thrones is THE BEST!,4,"game of thrones is the best shows ever i'don't understand why people hate this season
come on!"
2019-05-20,sambo-searle,Final episode,5,can't even begin to describe how bad this was. i defended season 8 up until this final episode. really really bad. nothing can redeem this and the series will be judged on it. sad ending but for the wrong reasons. diabolical.
2014-12-24,aklohia12,One of the best shows on TV,1,"this is by far one of the best television shows out right now. everybody has heard about game of thrones. it is quite possibly one of the most famous and well known tv shows out and everybody knows at least 1 person that watches it. i started watching when the show was on season 2 after a lot of my friends were talking about how great it was. i have not read the books. i'll be honest, the show is pretty tough to keep up with at first. if you haven't read the books, be prepared to do a bunch of recap readings because you will be confused in the first two or three episodes. there are a lot of characters introduced, and becoming familiar with who everyone is and the relationships takes some getting used to. however, after the first three episodes, i was quite accustomed with who people were and how they were related to each other.the plot is amazing. it is a very good complex in,depth story, and the pacing is fantastic. i am never bored during an episode. especially considering that nobody is safe on this episode. every character is disposable. there were important characters who i thought would never die that get killed off randomly. and these characters aren't just unimportant side characters. there have been a ton of main characters that have been killed off. it just makes the stakes that much higher and each episode is made so much more interesting because of that. the acting is superb. every actor does a great job. i especially love peter dinklage, lena headey, emilia clarke, maisie williams and kit harington. their performances are outstanding. however, every other performance is also fantastic. the actors clearly really care about their performances.the effects are also marvelous. the big battles look epic and really nice especially for a television show. the white walkers and dragons also look really nice. the settings are also all beautifully crafted and look gorgeous.this is not a show for the weak hearted. there is a ton of gruesome violence and a ton of graphic nudity. many people say that game of thrones is basically a porno and it pretty much is. there is nudity in almost every episode whether it be topless girls or full frontal. got does not hold back. however, there are some absolute gorgeous ladies that have gotten nude on this show like daenarys, shae, ygritte, margaery, melisandre, and many many more. for me, this is just icing on the cake of a very good show.as my friend described it, this show has everything a guy could want from a tv show: an amazing story, tons of violence, tons of nudity and sex, dragons, magic, and zombies. it is an absolutely amazing show that really does deserve all the praise, and i simply cannot wait for season 5 to come out."
2018-04-18,fahad_irfan_baba,The greatest show ever made,10,"itz simply the best show i have ever seen. to b honest,for the level got has got me in, all other shows in same genre seem less interesting as compared against got. the best part abt this show is the pilot twist, seriously, wat ever u r anticipating about the flow of story line, dont keep ur hopes high.  the actors are doing incredibly great job especially,peter dinklage. u gotta love to like the gud portraying characters nd hate the villains.
hatsoff to the writer of books(george r r martin), producers,directors,and actors. 
i gotta say ""there is not ,there never was nd there never b a show as great as game of thrones""."
2015-06-04,darko-cepic,Looks like Mexican soap(TV series),5,"first i saw it is, where are the battles only one in 4 season in blackwater bay if i may call this a battle. 2nd thing is to much talking this tv show looks like mexican tv series (soaps) like i don't know kasandra,esmeralda :p the good side are cities especially in essos mirin, yunkai and others. to much dead people and probably only lanister's will be live people in the end of series. only good characters in series are dead edard and rob stark. i think that the names of castles in westeros are simple kings landing ex. and obviously the westeros is middle age england i guess winterfall is northumbria for ex. and the vikings are so much better the got. p.s. sorry for my english, it's not my first language. :)"
2019-05-21,jakobdehman,Great show regardless of S8 or not.,10,"if you ignore the final half of the eighth season, got had a pretty great run. the writing got worse in the last few seasons,nut the acting atleast kept it interesting. the first 4 seasons are the best of any show i have seen. too bad the last season was so disappointing. #teambrienne"
2019-11-11,jshstvnsn,Pure gold.. up until season 7 season 8 was pure garbage,9,"one of my favorite shows of all times, but the last season was the absolute worst. i cant believe anyone in their right mind thought it would be ok to ruin such a masterpiece. i dont even normally like fantasy shows, but this got me hooked in and every season got better and better until season 7.
then season 8 was the worst"
2020-08-13,shehapm,My disappointment With The Series Came As Early As the first season.,10,"when they killed lord stark.i gave it a try, since it's that famous and highly rated, and i was interested and watched the first 9 episodes with great joy, then came the final episode in which lord stark was murdered.. then no character nor plot have gotten me interested afterwards.i didn't need to reach the final season, it's obvious it's an annoying series from the end of season one..although i had high hopes for it."
2019-04-22,ehsan_irana,Best,8,"i love the world of got, i can feel it... the best tv series ever!"

2015-11-07,paperandbooks,My favourite series ever!,10,"i'm just gonna say that game of thrones is my favourite series of all times. if you want action, fantasy, power games, sex, love and a lot, really a lot of fights and battles, you should watch game of thrones. like, right now. i mean it.game of thrones is the first series i've ever seen in my life, and it obviously have a very special meaning for me; but that's not the only reason because i love got. i love daenerys, and tyrion, and arya and a lot of characters; but i hate a lot too. i think it's just axesome how in a sooo large cast of characters the viewer know (and hate or love) every single one of them. i love the way all the story lines crosses in one point and separate in the other, and i love the fact that we, all the fans, have fear as hell that one of our fave characters die in the next episode."
2019-05-10,motorcyclepro,From greatness to shambles,10,"they have officially ruined got with season 8. if i were to recommend the show to someone which i doubt i will anymore, but if i did, i would tell them to stop watching at the end of season 7 and let there imagination take it from there. they have officially killed the story in season 8. this mistake is on the writers of the show not george r.r. martin. the writers of the show one of which is the same guy who sewed deadpools mouth shut in x,men origins which should have been a warning to the fans."
2020-06-03,lastronome,almost perfect,8,a series like never seen before which rocked last season on a flop! congratulations anyway
2021-04-13,umberto88,A ruined masterpiece,9,"got should have been the greatest television series ever made. and until the end of season 6 it was. the show had everything: superb writing, outstanding production values, epic scale, gritty and complex characters, likable villains and unlikable heroes, blood and guts, plenty of suspense and let's not forget some pretty frank treatment of sex too. the show was very modern (e.g. most of its surviving leading characters were women), without being preachy or shrill about it. one of the got's most appealing aspects has always been that it's hard to distinguish heroes from villains here, and the show tries hard tp prevent the viewers from classifying the characters in those terms. (of course, there are exceptions, like joffrey.) while over time the audience gets more and more emotionally invested in the characters of daeneris and jon, and to somewhat lesser extent arya and sansa, they are also portrayed as rather flawed, complex and contradictory figures, that chase and grow over time. for me the high point of the show was episode 10 of season 6, with the aftermath of cersei's trial. if the show had ended then, i would have gave it 10/10. the 7,th season was still watchable and entertaining but the quality of writing clearly went down. while the pace of the action picked up, somehow it also felt more perfunctory and it became harder to care. nothing like the episode ""the door"" in this season. and the of course comes season 8. as many other reviewers noted, a complete and utter disaster. the writing completely collapsed, cartoonishly so, and the storyline became nonsensical and full of holes. a good final episode might have still saved the season and the series but instead we were handed a cruel and disgusting joke. for much of the duration of the series the show's creators prided themselves on unexpected plot twists and staying ahead of the audience, keeping it guessing. but that cannot be the point of the grand finale of the magnum epic like got. here you have to deliver the expected. the most predictable and the most satisfying moment in the final episode was the ""clegane bowl"". and i have not heard anyone complain about it. but you cannot build up the audience's emotional investment in the fate of the main character over the period of 8 years and then suddenly turn her form a queen-to-be into a raving mass murderer and kill her off. and on top of that discard the second most important character in the series as an unimportant afterthought. that's a complete betrayal of the loyalties of the audience of the series and it made it impossible to rewatch the show for most people. a great pity, really, since many of the early episodes are true masterpieces. but the vanity and the stupidity of the writers in the finale killed the entire series."
2019-05-20,rjac-61787,First 20 min good and then ???????? Why ??????,10,"my favourite show and still is , what a pity for the end , the true king and everything that came before just cast away and rushed for a quick ending thanks 😡😡😡😡😡"
2019-05-22,mernawalid,Best show you can ever see except for the ending,10,"this show is one of hbo's greatest shows from script to directing to plot twists that are so mind blowing you'd have to repeat the entire episode to understand what the hell just happened. if you are someone considering watching game of thrones because of all the fuss around it then it's totally worth it dive in, a great fantasy and this is coming from someone who was sceptical at first about the show..i mean dragons and stuff i wasn't into that but i thought i'd give it a try because why not? and trust me it is an eyepeeling show that you will enjoy binjwatching now the seasons from one through six were impeccable as they were based on martin's books a song of ice and fire but after that it went south a little but it doesn't ruin the entire show! i mean it was terrible i agree, rushed and not thought through but the show still on of the best and will always be one of my favorite."
2019-05-20,rsthunder,Great Show but season 7 disapointing,10,"i loved the game of thrones but overall give it a 7, would have been a 10 had the final season been better. all the buildup for the long night battle against white walkers didn't even come close to what should of been so much better big let down there, season 7 the last episode was just ridiculous, cersei lannister should of been killed off in a much more justified satisfied way, season 7 didn't make much sense, i was okay with bran stark becoming king but so pathetic the way they killed off daenarys and just turned her into this blood thirsty killer ruler just terrible ending season and awful season finale i am not going to demand a remake of the season, at the end of the day its just a television, if we don't like it then lets not put our money or time with these producers again, if ever again they produce something i wont watch just so disappointing!"
2019-08-08,gamingneroperry,Watch ONLY Seasons 1-6,1,"do not watch seasons 7,8 if you want to be disappointed by the series ending by 2 idiots who wants to throw it to the trash yes im taking about dumb and dumber david benioff
and db weiss
so i recommend you to watch season's 1-6
becuase of the interesting story and music.
but do yourself a favor and dont watch season 7 and season 8"
2019-05-21,willravi,When most awaited season(season8) ruined all previous work,10,"after season 7 i had an expectation that something will happen as vince gilligan did in breaking bad, something that no one will forget, but now it's over and i won't panic recalling the whole story.till season 7 you will enjoy this but finally this will disappoint you. may be they were lacking script or they never though in 2011 that got will become most popular tv series in 2019 so they never thought of a good ending(at least if not satisfying ).."
2019-05-27,moezbk,"Good Show , bad writing for S7 - S8",10,i used to give got a 10/10 but unfortunately after the last 2 seasons this show became a joke
2019-05-28,gswms,Final Season ruined it,10,what else can i say. they should have dragged it out to build the suspense and come up with some better ideas to end it.
2019-05-20,aziz_essa,Update!,10,i changed my rating from 10/10 to 9/10 just because of the last season and specially the last episode. actually it deserves 8/10 or 7/10 because of the last season. but it's very sad to give game of thrones 7/10...
2020-11-29,colts-93955,T.V. GOLD,10,"one of the best television series ever made. this show has it all, drama, action, love, sex, fantasy. a must watch for everyone. not for kids. there is a lot of nudity. the actors are amazing and play the characters on point. peter dinklage is amazing in his role and so is lena headey. must watch. only 7 season with 7 to 10 episode a season."
2020-10-23,edriannilopangilinan,It's still a great series.,10,"season 8 was a disaster, but overall it's still a great series. stop judging the whole series just because s8 was a disaster. s1,s6 was outstanding, s7 is still great and s8 is not what we expected. this is one of the most unforgettable series, first because of it's outstanding seasons and second because of it's finale. it's still worth watching, sadly the series got rushed. it's still a great series, people are acting like it's only season is s8. people forgot how epic and amazing this series is, and they only remember the mistakes and bad stuffs. this series doesn't deserve a 1-5 rating, the writing might be bad, but you can't deny the acting, cinematography, and the music in this series are outstanding."
2018-06-01,codfather-84460,The best TV show right now,10,"this show really showed me how you build up characters, how to create a convincing plot and story and how to utilise upcoming actors to their fullest extent.the biggest positive may be a recurring comment on all reviews of this show but that is the way they build up characters. you never can tell if a character is going to make it to the end of the show or is going to die the next episode which is the beauty of it. every character has their own little segment of the episode dedicated to their character which is something that i can truly adore. each character is meticulously developed each season and despite their being some characters that you would immediately dislike, you do get moments with the exact same character where you totally sympathise with in one scene which is truly admirable.the acting is some of the most convincing i've ever seen in a tv show even though they shouldn't as it's a fantasy show but every episode can be taken seriously with emotion and pure grit.the score in every scene is absolutely gorgeous and wows me every time alone."
2020-06-26,chiraggulatiwwe,Best show ever!,9,this isn't a show.. it's a journey. a journey which starts from a small place called winterfell. what i loved abt this show is that it will never let you bore. there is always a twist and turning point. which will tie you watch the next episode and so on. if you want to live a journey and want to experience a different life. then you must watch this show.
2019-04-29,ravijani,Just go and watch s08e03 and you'll give 10/10,9,i wasn't planning to review this series.. at first i liked it.. then i just loved it.. trust me probably it's the best live action tv series ever made on the planet earth.. you only live once..so..just go and watch it for sure..and make your life worth living.

2019-05-13,davorbounty,Greatest TV show that i ever watched!,8,"honestly, i was skeptic at first. i thought that it is something non realistic and something forced and overhyped. i was bored and started watching it. first few episodes was boring. but then.. trust me you wont be able to stop watching! i watched all the episodes, all the seasons in a week! i was practically a no lifer that days. i was going to sleep at 11pm saying to myself ""i'm going to watch 1 episode and then sleep"" and then i was finding myself at 5am still watching the show. of all the movie's and all the shows i ever watched, this is the best thing by far! doesn't matter what age you are and which genres you like, there is a character for everyone to identify with. so much unpredictable shocking moments like you've never seen, interesting dialogues, big adventures and epic battles. it's really hard to find words to describe it. i highly recommend this show to everyone!"

2019-05-24,bil-94029,What Was That?,7,season 7 was bad. season 8 was terrible. script writing for season 8 was just horrible. i couldn't believe that the same leading characters from first 6 seasons would do that nonsense. i think got creators didn't even try to do their job properly.
2019-05-27,lattastenmarck,The directors destroyed this by forcing the end,6,"i think the end is as bad as a m'night movie ""twist"". the show feels like its scraping for crumbs on the ground left by the other better seasons. so instead of watching the last season, watch breaking bad again."
2019-05-28,mickdlee,Ending???,10,"game of thrones was one of my favourite series and was a solid 9 or 10 throughout seasons 1 to 7. i thought season 8 started well but then just nose dived in the last 2 episodes. what were they thinking? it's like they sat round a table with a list of endings and they decided to pick the lamest, blandest one. where was the quality control? i was planning on watching the whole thing again once it had finished, but now, what's the point? when i know it ends so poorly. unfortunately, it has tainted the whole thing for me, and takes it down to a 5. i won't be watching it again and will be selling my box sets. massively disappointed.
watch chernobyl instead. more shocking and real. and you don't have to take 2 weeks off work to watch it."
2019-12-10,andrei-19404,"don't watch it, it won't end well",8,"season 6,8 was like the homework you would do 10 minutes before the actual lesson"
2019-08-04,felis_lynx,Top of the Crop,10,"before got, it would have been very hard to name an example of a good medieval fantasy show. got has shown how this can be done , perhaps there is some hope for the future in this genre.i find it interesting to see how much political controversy got has generated between 2011-2019. it's a good example of what happens when a fantasy show leaves the confines of a pleasantly nerdy core audience and matures into a global phenomenon. think about, for example, the various gender battles or the curious debate about dragons as an analogy to nuclear weapons. much to the joy of languishing medieval history departments, got has also revitalized interest in heraldry and genealogy as auxialliary sciences.overall, it's just a very remarkable show: the storyline is complex, but strangely easy to follow. the visuals are stunning, the music compelling (think about the lannister and greyjoy themes!), and the dialogues are often approaching the philosophical. probably no other tv show has generated as many memorable pop culture quotes and memes as got. over the course of time, viewers got strongly attached to individual characters - just think about all of those facebook quizzes aiming to determine: ""which got character would you be?""interestingly, it's not just the key protagonists of the show that are captivating characters. it's true that tyrion lannister, jon snow and arya stark have remained all-time favorites of the audience. however, i have always found many of the secondary characters to be particularly memorable. some of them are archetypes, but they always have some twist. the caleidoscope encompasses machiavellian princes with family issues (tywin lannister), cheerfully corrupt mercenaries (bronn), valiant geriatric knights (barristan selmy), redeemed star-crossed slave-traders (jorah mormont), altruistically scheming eunuchs (lord varys), romantic barbarians (khal drogo), and many others.imagine this vast array of characters pursuing their respective agenda against the backdrop of some of the most visually stunning sets and sceneries the history of tv has ever seen, ranging from the wind-swept and salt-encrusted iron islands to the scorching heat of the dothraki steppes and the snow-covered mountains beyond the wall. there is a real sense of epic story-telling here.on a meta-level, this show has become an essential reference if you are interested in modern pop culture and contemporary quality tv. has it deteriorated since its inception? if you look at the typical life cycle of serial tv criticism, reviewers will always gravitate towards more negative reviews as a series progresses through its seasons. this is partially due to genuine saturation of the audience, but partially also due to a somewhat lass genuine desire of reviewers to appear original. more often than not, it's the perception of the viewer that changes and not the style of the show (it's a typical cognitive bias). nonetheless, i believe the accusation is somewhat true with regard to got. after the departure from g.r.r. martin's original work, the show often felt more fast-paced, but also less plausible and (as far as this word should be used for a medieval fantasy show) less authentic. attention to details and ""historical mechanics"" were often exchanged against what was believed to be a more palatable dramaturgy.having said all this, in the end this remains one of the most enjoyable and compelling shows i have ever watched."
2019-09-20,shadesofdarrk,Love and hate,10,i hate the final season as much as i love all the other seasons. it was the best ever tv series for me just before watching the final season.
2020-04-19,davitdashtoyan,"A masterpiece, despite the eighth season",8,"a series that just needs to be loved, it has everything: death, life, love, beautiful landscapes, good acting, a completely invented world, war, royal affairs. even the fact that the writers drowned everything that was possible in the eighth season, it does not prevent you from enjoying this world that martin created. i hope that the book will be much better and more logical than it was at the end of the last season. just enjoy it."
2019-05-20,rahuldahiya,A fantasy that was more real than reality,1,"i just watched the last episode of game of thrones and writing this review almost because i have to.to be honest when i watched the first episode, i barely finished it and never saw another episode again until season 3. then, something clicked for me and i was transported to westeros. for 6 years, i have been a citizen of westeros awaiting the coming of the rightful king/queen. now that the journey is over, a void will take over. the wait will start again. it feels that winter will come again."
2020-04-24,ajmalhanifi,Fantastic,4,we must accept the truth and know that eveey series doesnt hase a good endings . so got is better in every form and better say its best. just a noble show it deseeves 10/10 love this show and accept its best on history.
2020-02-20,baldymcbaldy-55804,Could have been a 9 or 10,10,"the first...six....seasons were incredibly done. the seventh was...eh...ok. the final season and the ending? wow. what a disappointment. should you watch it? yes, it is definitely worth it. you must binge watch it however because there are just too many characters to keep track of to watch it any other way."
2020-10-17,simplydan-31480,Would have been 10/10.,8,"game of thrones is and always will be one of my favourite shows ever made. i would have given it a 10 if it weren't for season 8. from seasons 1,7, the show was a perfect example of great storytelling and character development. but s8 threw all of it out the window.
its disapointing, but game of thrones will always remain as one of the best tv shows of all time."
2020-03-24,hussienkritus,The best thing i've ever seen!?,10,"for a series i think that got is the best ever , the way that george rr martin made this masterpiece and not forget to mention ramin dejwadi great music it made extra ordinary thing i really love it , the 8 season was not what i expected to be i think that alot of work was just move faster than usual but after all the background music was epic and really emotinal it made me fell in love in music world 10/10 for this masterpiece hands down"

2021-07-04,tytheasian,King of Hollywood,6,"you'll see a lot of reviews say that the last two seasons aren't great but i for one disagree and here's why. we spend a lot of time ""going through it"" with these characters and we develop wants and desires for these characters (to live, to die, fall in love, etc.). got has a lot of characters and they all go through some character development so it's easy to over look or agree with the bad things some characters do. resulting in conflict with ""desires"" and ""morals"" and whether our favorite character is doing the right thing or not we agree with their actions. i personally think the show couldn't have been better it has action, love, laughs, and it can inspire hope and a fire to fight."

2021-01-03,keeganboelman,Best show ever till the ending,10,this show has been one of my favourites 10/10 but since i've seen the last season i can't even rate this show anymore it ruined everything i loved about this show so i can't even give it 1/10 or 10/10 just a broken heart
2021-09-14,brettgozza,Greatest Of all Time.,8,"to those complaining about seasons 7 and 8, stop it! the arguments are almost all about it being unbelievable, unrealistic timelines and the like. it's fantasy people, not historical fact. the biggest complainers are almost entirely about ""their"" queen turning out to being a psychopath, when it was clear very early that was the path she was turning to.for me, binging it brought all the timelines into perspective, and the understanding that afterall, this was the story of the starks.the story was brilliant, the acting brilliant, the locations and filming brilliant, and yes, the ending for me, was perfect. could it have ended better? that depends on your own personal perspective. if you think your queen is good while massacreing thousands of innocent, a mirror would be a more appropriate ending? maybe you supported the incestuous lannisters, or the incompetent baratheons. in the end, the ""good "" won out. as it should be."
2011-09-26,demented_baboon,Can't wait for the second season,1,"cruel, bloody, vulgar, machiavellian, unrepentant. and that is just the writing. the camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. and all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting i've ever seen. from lena headey as soft spoken cersei to peter vaughan as ancient maester aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. peter dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; i've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.can't wait for season 2."
2021-03-22,emmanueloblea,The best tv show in my opinion to-date,1,"the entire show was interesting and will definitely keep you engaged 'til the last season. i admire how genius the plots were, how the characters and actors really played their role well. i just admire this show a lot."
2021-05-05,koracta,A masterpiece of fantasy,1,"this series was the one that got me into tv shows in the first place.at the time, this was revolutionary in its adult way of portraying fantasy, and up until season 6/7, i really thought there couldn't be any better tv show.would recommend it for sure."
2021-05-03,adolphasdroids,Best ever,10,this is the best series i have ever watched my entire life. the flow of the story is just superb. the last episode though was not how i expected. its a ten times a million for me.
2021-06-08,cobbjoseph,Most addictive and emotional TV show ever made,10,"lots of people have criticised how the show ended. dany fans think this is the worst finale whereas tyrion and jon fans think it is okay.for me it was emotionally satisfying ending , it could have been more awesome, but still good.dragons , king, mystery , complicated characters got has all you want. watch battle scenes so intense that you would pray for your protagonist life whole the time. witness some of the most complicated characters ever written executed with brilliant performances.we have breaking bad , sapronas but we don't have any other show as got and neither there ever will be."
2021-07-17,dylanovich,Excellent show,10,"this show shocked me as i did not expect much going into it but after watching the first episode i was hooked instantly, the show was excellent, season 8 had good battles and lots of action but not alot of story it seemed a little rushed but if season 8 had 10 eps it might have had more story and a better ending other than that season 8 was good and every other season was excellent in my top 5 shows."
2011-12-04,kellow,Confusing but brilliant,9,"being a huge fan of the fantasy genre, i knew this series would be right up my street, and i was in no way disappointed. the intertwining story arcs tell a compelling story, in which there are no definitive goodies or baddies, although british viewers might pick up on the annoying pattern whereby the more northern somebody's accent is, then the more likely they are to be noble (and will also be a bit confused at how people in the same family can have randomly acquired manc, scouse or geordie accents). also, despite the fantastic sets, you do sometimes feel a bit short,changed with the visuals. viewers groomed on the visual splendour of the likes of the lord of the rings may feel a bit let down by the made-for-tv feel of supposedly epic scenes. rather than fearsome armies, most of the troops and 'battle' scenes sometimes don't fool us into believing we are watching anything other than what they really are, namely a small group of extras on horses and holding cardboard shields in a field in northern ireland. and the sex? i love a bit of porn as much as the next man, but in got it does sometimes seem a little gratuitous. in one scene, where bran is talking to the wild woman, a naked 'giant' appears from the bushes, before he is told to go and put some clothes on and runs off. what on earth did that have to do with the story other than the chance for us to see another penis? and it does get very confusing at points. the first episode introduces so many different characters that when it gets to the key scene at the end, i was so lost that i had no idea who the two people were in the tower, let alone that it was a queen having sex with her brother. the series does a great job of explaining everything, but even so, for those like myself who never read the book, it's hard to follow who the various hangers on in the court in the south and the seemingly eternal string of stark siblings are. names like jaime, theon and tyron keep cropping up, but it all happens so fast that the less informed viewer ends up not having a clue who they are talking about. but these gripes aside, what a terrific series and i can't wait for the second. unlike so many series, in this one it really is hard to see what's coming, helped by the fact that a number of central characters get killed. in got, you never feel the dramatic tension lost because you know there's no way so-and-so is going to be killed. i was dreading a similar fate would befall daenerys  one of the most delightful pieces of eye candy ever to appear on tv. and the underlying message for me at least is how so many real battles were fought not for the good of the people but to satisfy the whims of royalty. it is the growing threat from north of the wall that these people should really be worrying about, but instead they continue to shed blood in the name of their petty family feuds. a nice allegory for how the world today sees nations vying with each other rather than fighting for the things that really matter."
2013-06-09,tudor_a,Best TV Series I have ever seen.,8,"this show is so good, it made me watch its first two seasons for five times until now. each time i discovered new, more subtle details, which gave the story even more meaning. i have never been so hooked up to a show.the story is extremely captivating. there are a lot of subplots, more or less interconnected to each other, each having its own characteristic ""color"". one can tell immediately that it is based on a good book.the characters are complex. a good versus evil split between them is hard to draw, since you can easily relate to them through different situations. this is very pleasantly surprising, given the fact that the show depicts a fantasy world, which would automatically lead to the good/evil split like in so many fantasy worlds (e.g. lord of the rings, harry potter, chronicles of narnia...). but not this show. here you can see a fantasy world which is closer to the real one, where people act as driven by different reasons, beliefs or desires.the plot is often breathtaking, and the show is filled with shocking events, which make you question you expectations a lot. the drama is so good, there were a couple of big moments throughout the show where the major goosebumps i experienced were accompanied by trembling hands and wet eyes.if you haven't watched this show yet, you don't know what you're missing!"
2015-05-28,laszlo-janszky,Booooring,8,"i watched got until the end of the 4th season. it's about nothing but soft porn and uncensored disgusting deaths. the story is much slower than by lotr (which is slow), and there are no great battle scenes which could make it better. there is just talking, sometimes sword fight, torturing, that's all, no one to empathize with, nothing to learn from, nothing exciting. even watching ants is more fun (i guess). it is like a bubble, shiny, full of colors, but there is nothing inside, there is no value in it. i guess people who don't want to think, just watch, can really enjoy it. good for them, but not for me. i decided not to waste my time with this series ever again. :,)"
2011-04-18,ilinx,"First episode too rushed, but getting better!",1,"to start i should mention that i'm a die hard fan of the books, and consequently had ever,so-high expectations of this series, so of course i was bound to be at least partially disappointed. however, i think they've done a fair job in putting the book to the screen, as much as i can judge from the opening episode. the art direction is commendable, and it was amazing to see the book come to life in that sense (particularly the wall!). great care has been taken with costuming, locations, and props. i have absolutely no complaints in this sense. also, the plot has been followed so far in its critical points (for us fans)... compacted and adjusted when necessary in quite effective ways. the casting is mixed, but in general does a fair job of representing the book's characters. the actor who plays bran could not have been better chosen. tyrion, arya, sansa, eddard, and others are very good as well. but still others are not as strong, such as jamie and cercei lannister (they needed to be much bolder and ruthless figures in order for later character development to really pan out). some characters seem to have been changed a bit... such as illyrio, who in the book is a much more flamboyant and pretentious character. but in general i think the actors will do. all which bodes well for the series' future. however...my greatest criticism is that they rushed through too many things in the first episode, at the cost of sacrificing suspense and interest in the characters. there really was no need for this. the books are perfectly written to be made into a series (at least books 1-3), and the ambition to introduce all the characters in one go really sacrificed the book's careful character development (one that almost seemed pre-planned to be adapted for television... every two chapters would make an hour of television with a perfect hook point almost without exception). you don't get a chance to feel any of the characters. when bran falls at the end of the episode, you really should have felt a terrible sense of loss. not just curiosity about seeing the next episode. you should despise jamie and cercei lannister from the start (very important if the series is to take you into the the second and third books). i think it would have paid off a lot more to get you to care deeply about one or two of the characters. there was no need to introduce pentos just yet, for example. there was no need to make you understand the entire world situation in one go. it greatly sacrificed the suspense. rushing through thing like that only made everything seem wooden and soulless. i think even my assessment of many of the actors is based on them not having the ""room"" to really develop their characters yet.i hope it was just the fear of not hooking the audience that led them to this rush, and that future episodes will allow the emotional suspense needed for this to really be a successful series. it does worry me that these are the same people behind rome (i think it would have been better for the series if say, the producers of deadwood developed it). rome suffered from some of the same ""soap opera-ish"" type development. in some ways it reflects martin's writing very well (the crassness, the sex, etc.), but so far it's really missing the subtlety of his characters (the greatest feature of the books by far, along with the political complexity). this is just the first episode, though. first episodes are tough. so i have my fingers crossed. they have gotten a lot of things right, and george r.r. martin's books were begging to be made into a series... it will be a real shame if the result is mediocre.second episode update: much better. the pace has slowed a bit, the emotional impact is greater. i think coaster-waldau (jamie) has more promise than i at first believed. peter dinklage i thought was perfect for tyrion and in the second episode he confirms it fully. i still don't think lena headey is right for the part of cercei... not in any way due to her acting, but her style in general. she is too earthy and much too likable. cercei i thought should be cold, uppity, distant, too elegant. all in all the cast will do just fine if the pace isn't hurried. i now do look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes. *phew*"
2015-06-27,sapiens22,Better than a cake.,10,"i will start with saying that all these initial reviews on imdb by the users are laughable , people had watched just one or few episodes and were dull enough to think they have tasted the full cake. onwards with the show - first episodes feel indeed leaving you very much puzzled about who is who, what is going on, who are the persons mentioned in ascribed events and how precisely were they involved. for the people like me who haven't read the novel there is so much of story to soak up that it's easily to get lost and to be left with a need to rewatch the episode to fully grasp the big picture. but as the series continue and plotting of characters (that you are already familiar with from the first episode) progress you will start to clue the puzzling threads together. and as events also progress the main characters become more and more interesting, fascinating, sympathetic or abominable. i'd just recently started watching the series and i don't regret making through first few episodes. each episode adds more and more to the table leaving you wondering and wanting to see next one."
2019-05-30,tokyo87,Recommended viewing order,1,"1: watch season 1 to 6 for they are masterpieces. 2 (optional): if you have no other series you are addicted to, watch the additional season 7. it's very cool.
3: wait for g.r.r. martin to finish the remaining books to see how the story ends.
4: forget that season 8 ever happened. don't ever ask about it. trust me. pretend it doesn't exist."
2019-05-02,andre-bobrov,"Well, it's stupid.",1,"extremely stupid conversations most of the time. have a feeling it's made for 12 years old.night king is the best actor and character. only reason why i watched this.there is no need for spoilers because you know how it ends from the beginning.dark scenes are made badly and too dark. i can't see nothing because of brightness.you can clearly see different directors during each epusode, different styles. most of the time series are extremely boring. love some great shots tho. library scene in episode 3 season 8 is fantastic.well, i can't understand why there is so much hype about this one. i mean this is worth one 2 hour movie not 8 seasons. happy for people who loved this boring stretching.so bad story i don't want to write anything anything else."
2014-08-25,whas,I've never seen a TV show like this one!,1,"i've always used to see many tv shows, but when, on april 2014, i saw game of thrones for the first time, i realized that it is much more than just a tv show: maybe, someday this will became epic, and children will study got instead of ancient greek mythology etc.i don't like to read the book after i've seen the movie or see the movie after i've liked a book, but this time i'm reading all the books, i'm already at the third one, also if i have a busy life!landscapes are wonderful, such as the show is based on real middle,age history and customs. it is called fantasy, and i've heard many guys saying that got it's just violence and nudes, but it is not. there is just a few magic, but the real wars are fought with brains, and as the show goes on, you won't care anymore of blood and sexuality.there is not any main character, anyone could die in every single moment, this is sometimes sad, but i've never seen anything like that!perfect casting, george r.r. martin is a master of suspense...what else do i have to say? just see it!"
2019-05-20,mister_dustin,Game of thrones,9,the whole series was awesome but i was very disappointing that you killed daenerys targaryen after all shes been thru that was just lame
2011-12-02,atiila,Really great,10,"i've seen by accident that the novel was turned into a tv series. i watched all parts in in two rows and now i'm unhappy, of course april is that far away.i don't want to give a summary, i just want to say this: as i read the books, i thought that would be great as a movie like lord of the rings. as series it's even better, of course the story isn't shortened. all fantasy series i've seen so far, are made cheap and lack of a good story. and with fantasy, i mean real fantasy, sword fighting and dragons. this is the adaption of a very good novel and it's realized well.for all fans of fantasy a must see. for all others ... forget what you have seen so far (except for rare stuff like lord of the rings and willow), try this out. may you will find your way to fantasy!"
2011-04-27,beavcleaver1,I think I know why some are conflicted...,10,"i came across this show today while browsing the internet for general fantasy films. during this search, i came across the books this series is based on, then i saw the reference to this show, which i immediately watched. i had no prior knowledge of this show, hadn't seen commercials, nothing. there was no ""hype"" for me.but as a fantasy genre fan, i absolutely love this show so far. i haven't read the books so i don't know how close the adaptation follows the original story.i have read lots of reviews and many rave just as i am, but i also read some negative reviews. mostly, i was wanting to know how other people felt about all the incest in the show. i noticed that this is not mentioned by anyone! people are talking about the ""sex and violence,"" but don't really say what it is that probably bothers them. like to even acknowledge the incest, may make one suspect to liking it or something? anyway, there is incest in this show and lots of it. maybe the people that read the books are numb to that or something, but it is in abundance. i'm really shocked that people are pretending to not notice this because i'm sure, since it's a major part of the story, that the incest is what is making this show such a huge hit. it's a bit controversial, hence some calling it more ""adult."" i would agree, but one could be more specific. the violence is nothing you've never seen before, but it's good. there is some female nudity that is just unnecessary sometimes as if they are doing it just because they can. that's probably the only thing that may be a little irritating, but it's certainly not so 'chocked full of sex that it's unwatchable' or even comparable to porn. i think this is why reading reviews can be sometimes confusing or complicating because things are not clarified or not too specific. to further add, i think those that were distracted by the sex enough to not like the show, may have blushed/were offended during one of the abundant incest scenes. as for the people that loved it, the incest is a vital part of the story and i wish people would be more comfortable with pointing that out for the rest of us. good show."
2019-05-24,mamie157-43-330992,My 2 Cents,10,"i'd like to write a review that balances my disappointment with the last season with the awe and respect i have for everyone who created this masterpiece. the last season felt lazy to me. i'm sure the people creating the show do not feel that way but i wonder if they can honestly say that yes, they put the same effort into the last season as they did every season prior. (ok maybe not season 7. while better than season 8 still not up to the standard set in seasons 1,6) i'm not displeased with the decisions made as to who died and who won the game. i actually think those are great parts of the story. i'm just disappointed in how it played out on screen. if you have not seen game of thrones, watch it! it's an amazing show! just know what you are getting into. i would even go as far to say watch the first 6-7 seasons and then just spend twenty minutes reading a synopsis of the last season. that's not being mean, i just don't think it's worth it. the bottom line is this, i enjoyed the show however i do not think i will be drawn into any other show created by the same team. i have no interest in becoming invested in a story and the characters just to better truly let down by the storytellers in the end. if the show were a written book (i know it's from the books. i'm saying the whole of the show) i wouldn't read another book by the author."
2021-04-24,fomille,Still a Great Show (9.5/10),10,"this show is about as good of television as you can find. with that being said, the ending is rushed and leaves you disappointed.i'll make it easy for you.ratings:season 1: 10season 2: 10season 3: 10season 4: 10season 5: 9.0season 6: 9.5season 7: 8.5 (rushed, but still great episodes)season 6: 5/10."
2012-07-15,j-m2002,Simply Addictive and amazing must watch,7,to all who have doubts of this show is missing a lot; i've seen the first season and finishing the second season but i am wanting more.a story that compelling leaves you with wanting to know what will happen next. known as an nominee for an all round spectacular show it shows kings for power but power is earned not taken. for those who take power it does not mean it is received but unfortunately it is given. but this element gives the edge that the show needs to be moving steadily as the most popular show on tv today. the climax is effective from episode to episode; personally i would like joffrey head on a spike. i am sure it won't cause usually he is well protected. for those who are looking for constant fight scenes and fruity ending it is not. it explores the human side and that is what i crave. transitionally the story works with how it goes from almost every character especially joffrey well played. others that got me going was the first season finale i mean you cannot argue with that. each episode has a sexual element and that also gives more true to the story of the gender role of the male and female in society. overall i will continue watching and season three is not to far hopefully they come out with fireworks in such a confusing period time power and absolution.
2019-05-20,davemgj,Used to be a 10/10 review...,6,"wow.... i am shocked, and lacking the words to describe the level of disappointment in regards to the final season and the finale of this series...used to think this was a work of art... now i am astonished at the incompetence of the writers and d&d for destroying everything about this story.truly sad and monumentally disappointing."
2012-02-24,johnnylongsome,An epic tale,10,"an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil. game of thrones is stunningly beautiful and a work of art out of the ordinary. rarely have i been so moved by a movie / series. a must not only for those who enjoy a fantastic medieval adventure, but also for those who wish to be blown away by a brilliant storyline, strong characters, unexpected twists, beautiful scenery, captivating dialogue, fast paced action scenes... i could go on forever. you will hate the evil characters and love the good ones, or the contrary if you wish. to feel such strong feelings for the characters in a movie / series is the ultimate proof of what masterpiece game of thrones really is."

2019-05-18,pnfkwfl,Did GoT just jump the shark?,5,"804 looked to me like got jumped the shark. there was not a single moment in 804 that would equate to fonzi jumping the shark. more like gratuitous dark everything layered over gratuitous violence and massive plot holes. all in a rush to tie up loose ends.805 has been no better.dont get me wrong, i'm eagerly waiting for 806 and have loved the series... i just keep expecting fonzi to make a cameo."
2019-05-13,foiser,What a f......g disappointment,6,"never again will i invest myself in a long form tv series again like this, only to go through what i did in season 8.to the makers of what could have been, but will not be, the greatest tv show in history: you can all go f...k yourself."
2018-12-18,patrickschenk13,Overrated snooze fest,10,"this show is completely overrated. first season was decent, but seems too drawn out. beheading here, battle scene, several episodes in between. i hope it gets better, after all the hype it receives, it certainly doesn't live up to it"
2013-05-13,michael-albertsen,"Well acted, well written, and well produced - but too extreme.",8,"i've seen all episodes so far, and i've finally made up my mind about this show.it's been a bit back and forth for me , and there have been times when i've greatly enjoyed it, which is why i can't be too harsh.i've read about half of the first book, just because i wanted to see how different it was - and it seems to me the show is quite loyal to the book in the important ways.now, i can see the appeal of this show - but i must say i disagree with the universal praise. it's obviously supposed to be a plausible reflection of medieval europe with some fantasy trappings - but i don't see how it succeeds.my primary issue is extremity. every character seems to be an extreme of one sort or another. i'm not saying they don't have nuances or that they're not ""grey"" - because they are, and that's fine. but their acts and their profile are basically extreme. this goes for all the primary characters - and almost all of the secondary characters.we have the most altruistic honorable people and we have the most excessively cruel sociopaths. they may have nuance and grey areas - but they're delivered through extremities.it's like the writer or the producers want to make an impression every few minutes. every time we establish a warrior as the greatest of all time - and we get some excessive act described or demonstrated, another warrior comes along that's just that little bit more extreme. constantly. how many ""best"" and ""most fierce"" warriors do we have again? bronn, nedd, kingslayer, rob, robert, bear, hound - and on and on and on. they're all superheroes, basically. they all have a well told tale of some superhuman act in the past that hammers into the head of the audience just how bad ass they really are. it's cool the first time - but not the 20th time. it loses its effect and you get diminishing returns.this goes for all the profile types, including the power-hungry lords and ladies and the schemers. each more extreme than the last. it goes for the ""evil"" people as well.every time we have a person behave in the most cruel way imaginable - we have another enter the scene and demonstrate why the last satanic individual was almost kind in comparison. lest the viewer/reader forgets how very harsh this world is.it's layer upon layer of extremities. it's as if the world has no subtlety and the characters are incapable of not trying their hardest to get noticed at every turn.to me, that's desperation. it's the desire to bring shock and awe over the desire to write or show real people with real issues. sure, the conditions are brutal - and people would naturally have to do a lot of questionable or brave things to survive - but not with every beat of their heart.if you want the greatest impact, what you do is that you pace your big scenes. you hold back and you build tension. you don't have to torture people visibly every other episode. one time is enough - and you don't have to make every character an extreme. some people have a harmony about them - and they can make a strong impression over time.all those ""cool"" scenes of torture, violence, sex and so on would be so much more profound if they didn't happen constantly.i understand the temptation of a writer who's trying to match a true great like tolkien. tolkien was very different - and his was a very romantic and mythological approach. but he understood subtlety and he didn't bring too much attention to his characters at every turn. no, he built tension slowly - and the effect was that much more powerful.that's something martin could learn from. yes, yes - the world is harsh and people suffer all the time. but even in the harshest of worlds, we will have the mundane and we will have average people failing or succeeding without going above or below average.subtlety did exist in medieval europe - i'm almost sure of it."
2013-05-05,chubley53,A ticking time bomb full of Wildfire,10,"let me start by saying that there are plenty of good fantasy films and tv shows out there, including the lord of the rings, once upon a time, and your highness... (that last one was a joke) but hbo's game of thrones stands at the top of the mountain when it comes to fantasy stories on the small screen. the sheer size and scope of the world created in a song of ice & fire is beautifully realized in the show, and the set pieces/costumes are very well done. the writers also did a fine job of staying true to the books, while also throwing some unexpected curve balls into the story to keep even the readers on their toes. each episode has intriguing dialogue, deceptive plots, and most episodes have some top,notch action scenes. season 2, episode 9 is particularly thrilling, and the battle of blackwater bay will not disappoint fans who have stuck with the show to see its epic climax. but the thing that i like best about this series is that all the events feel like they are leading toward an explosion of action. this ticking time bomb started with the reappearance of the white walkers, and came to another huge turning point at the end of season 1 with the birth of daenerys targaryen's dragons. eventually a war starts tearing apart the realm, and most of the characters have no knowledge of the white walkers, the targaryen uprising, or the vast army of wildlings marching south on the wall. season 3 is now underway, and they have shown 5 episodes so far. the war of five kings is really starting to heat up, and all of the major characters are taking big leaps as the story goes along. a storm of swords (the third book) is the only one i've read so far, but i must admit it was one of the best page-turning, action packed books i've ever read. the last 3 or 4 episodes of this season will be epic, and the show will only continue to grow in popularity after season 3 is over. so grab some popcorn and a big gulp, because winter is coming!"
2016-08-16,gary-ks,Not a masterpiece but it neither a trash,7,"this show is a hard one for me and i haven't been so ambivalent about a show or a movie like i'm with got. i've only seen first two seasons but i'm full with mixed emotions writing this review. from one side there few elements that i like but on the other side so many redundant details/characters bad acting and pseudo cleverness that some times i've straggled to finish an episode appalled from seeing something pretentious, partially baked and not genuine. but at the same time i do enjoy part of the story lines and some of the characters, which are played and developed brilliantly. i'll try to list my biggest cons and pros which may contain some spoilers (only for first and second seasons). so, firstly the whole ""dragons/savages"" story line is completely ridiculous and utterly bad played by practically every character. i've actually hardly overcome and proceed seeing the show after the bad taste the first episode leaved because of all the hideous acting and filming involved in this story line. second major thing is the general confusion about where the action taking place and the fact that the show couldn't crate (or maybe didn't intend to) a real imaginary/fantasy world. most of the times you could definitely make a parallel to our reality and place the event somewhere in british island since the landscape, people (how they talk, dress, look and behave) and rule system is very similar. some other smaller details contribute to this dissonance for example characters like fencing teacher with an italian name and accent. this all made me wonder not once whether i'm watching a fantasy or a fiction story about middle ages. i also have an issue with the mass scenes – there are many of them in the got and practically all of them are unrealistic. scenes like military camps or people gathering are very common in got and many times you hear estimation for number of troops, but what you see in reality is very small crowd on the set or simply a camp with many tents but no soldiers. this leads me to conclusion that the wide range of story lines (which i actually like) made the producers to not give every one of them enough attention. additionally to these but probably less noticeable to most are the sometimes pretentious dialogues about power and higher matters. none of them i actually find hideously banal and indigestible but they are there to contribute to a general mediocrity impression. despite these major cons and few small ones which i want mention, the show manages to present many brilliant performances and colourful characters. all lanister's are very well cast and played especially tyrrion. jon snow and rob stark are very easy to relate and sympathize. i also consider the brutality and sexual content, although at times redundant, but rather a good tool to characterize human morals and manners at a particular time and place, which is as far as i'm concern is a medieval britain. as a conclusion i would suggest that the ability to present multiple great heroes and anti,heroes is the essence of the success of got. it's not a masterpiece but it neither a trash. it's easy to watch if you neglect some of the story lines and don't care for some recycled dialogues. the tension is building up as the winter is coming and multiple power are about to clash. so, i do eager to follow got to the 3 season but i also feel that i may lose interest in it as the cons may prevail over the pros."
2019-08-24,make_ur_luck,Still one of the greatest series made,1,"i will not lie .. this series was perfect.. even with season 8 ( ok the last one was a problem with me ) ... i don't know why people get upset from it but i'm ok ... and i will not put a explanations
that's my opinion
thank you d&d"
2019-01-13,ninja-turtle,Outstanding show,10,"i didn't start watching until earlier this year. i can't say exactly why as it had all of the elements of movies or shows i normally like. maybe i had too much going on at the time it began. maybe it was because there was so much hype that i didn't think it could live up to it. but i just finished season 4 and i have to say all of the accolades are well deserved. everything about this series...the cast, the complexity of the storytelling and how seamlessly it flows, the drama, the action, the cinematography...is amazing. i can't wait to watch seasons 5,7 before the final one airs."
2013-08-06,nmjones23,The uproar on the internet intrigued me.,6,"fantasy is not a genre i usually on well with. s03e09 'the rains of castamere' caused so much uproar on the internet that it was hard not to intrigue me. i gave the show a second chance, it took a while for me to think it as more than mediocre (i think this was because it takes a while to learn who everyone is and what they are related to / trying to achieve in the show , it's a big cast), but when i did, oh god, did the tv shock me. there's a few moments where your jaw will drop. but after a while - the mistreatment of characters becomes second nature, despite this, this show still finds way to cause dismay. the end of season 1 with jason momoas' character, the beginning of season 2 (with the babies), oh and let's not forget s03e09. i mean, holy s*** - what happened. it's just. i'm not going to give an explanation about this episode, or this show because, one didn't sell it for me. it's very popular. it has comical and witty dialogue. there are so many story-lines and characters, intertwining to satisfy your thirst. fabulous tv. peter dinklage was my favourite part about the show in episode 1 and that is still the case at the end of the 3rd season. daenerys a close second. she's 'bad*ss'. i'm still thinking about that episode. roll on s04!"
2019-10-07,olafpiers,Best series ever until they ruin it all in the last season,1,"don't bother watching.7 seasons of beauty, after which the directors took matters in their own hands and decided to ignore any storyline up to that point.george r. r. martin's legacy is ruined..."
2020-07-22,hellawakeoo,Overrated,10,it was ok at first but the constantly killing of main characters is ridiculous
2019-11-10,arjualikhan,A excellent start with a miserable ending,5,"watched the whole 8 seasons in 3 weeks, one after another. eventually, i was so imbibed into the plots and characters. i was not expecting a happy ending but jon, dany deserves a much better conclusion. although, i hated cersei throughout this journey. but, at the end i felt very bad for jaime and her. when i saw, tyrion clearing their face lying under a heap of bricks. season 8 ruined everything in my view. although, practically it is a wise choice for brandon to be the king, but wait! seriously? bran? anyway, i love the series and enjoyed it very much! thanks team got! i love denyrys, she is my queen."
2014-11-02,dssadhyapak,You need a lot of patience to watch this!,10,"please note that i have not read the books. so this review is completely based on the tv show.my my! what a show this is. it has a brilliant story, character development which is done very well (some movies / tv shows don't even care about this), and a whole lot of sex scenes and gore!yes,yes. i know. the first 4 episodes of the 1st season are boring as hell. it takes quite sometime in introducing all the characters, it confuses you as to who is what, but after a point of time it all gets fine. this show knows who must you hate, and who must you root for. it does this job perfectly. (tyrion lannister is my favourite. peter dinklage, you are an awesome actor!) there is the element of suspense, the action, the tension, the politics, the drama...so whats not to like about this?probably because of its slow start, loads of sex scenes, and confusing characters. i mean, come on. the sex scenes are unnecessary. i do agree with that. but whats to complain about it? when you have hot actresses like emilia clarke and rose leslie, why are you complaining? the books probably had them. so if they are staying true to the books, then what is wrong in that?you will get used to the characters in due course. so be a little patient about that. all the characters are well,acted by some really good actors. it was good that they shot some scenes in the dothraki or the valyrian language instead of everything in english. it instills that feeling of that medieval age thing in you.the main reason why i did not give this a full 10 was because of its very very slow start and that some parts of it that are still boring me. i really don't care about stannis baratheon or that red woman or the greyjoys. which is a bummer, coz if they start focusing more on someone who you don't like much, then you might probably start skipping their parts. you start to feel as if their parts could have been fast forwarded in terms of their storyline. one good example i can think of is the white walkers. i don't hate them in terms of their character, but they have not done much damage at all other than the opening scene in season 1 episode 1. i want to see them to do more damage to someone at least. they take so much time to cross the wall itself!!overall, this is a great show with a few flaws. and just because i gave it a 8 does not mean i don't like it. i love it. if you can imagine, i sat 4 hours a day watching 4 episodes each day and finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks! its that interesting sometimes.so do not google it, or even youtube about this show. coz there are idiots over there who have put so many spoilers here and there. so just go to some torrent website, download this and have fun.!i've tried my best to give a spoiler-free review. thanks for reading."
2019-05-13,athanasios-spyropoulos,Amazing,7,"possibly the greatest tv show to date. amazing story, acting, characters, production.. only negative is that we only get 8 seasons of this masterwork, but alas all good things have an end. dracarys!"
2020-12-22,deehee19,How the mighty fell!,9,"had the potential to be the greatest tv show in the history of mankind and one of the greatest fantasy epics ever, then season 8 happened. my family and i had never been so invested in a drama before so the disappointment of season 8 was palpable. i felt like i had wasted hours of my life watching and discussing thrones, all to amount to the utter disaster that was the finale season. hence i give this a jarring 1 star."
2012-04-15,zannatlaws,Everything but the kitchen sink,7,"the series game of thrones is a very entertaining précis of the enormously thick books! the production values are very high and it all has a gritty and real feel to it. extremely well done and i hope they are able to adapt the whole saga. trouble is, whenever something good comes along it always seems to be the first thing to be cancelled!however, after reading the books i thought , i've read this story before - often word for word. i am not sure if i am remembering correctly but robin hobbs 'assassin' series springs to mind. anyway, whichever series it was all i recall of that other story is that it was tedious and repetitious - at least george martin made it more interesting!!"
2018-07-08,zannatlaws,Heart of the story without the waffle,10,"this is one of those rare incidences where the adaptation is better than the books! i've read the books and prefer the series. it's grim, grimy and everyone, except a few, are truly nasty!! brilliantly done and fantastic acting. as yet i don't know how the story wraps up but tyrion lannister (peter dinklage) had better survive!!however, there is a big hmmmmmm coming on!! at the moment i'm reading the fabulous helliconia trilogy (spring, summer, winter) by brian aldiss. this majestic tale encompasses (amongst other things) extreme climate change and in the final volume published in 1985 there is the repeated phrase 'winter is coming'.1985? you do the math!"
2018-12-04,mohlut1995,"Masterclass , peice of art , even better",10,"this work is untochable , the best cenimatic work ever done ... everything is just perfct and beyond description . its really amazing when you relize how much effort is done to produce this mind blowing series . acting , background music , characters , plot , ...... everything is faaantastic .update : its decling in season 7 & 8 , so many plot holes . it turned to be just a good show after this bad ending , im very dissappointed ."
2019-05-20,burhan2366,I lost my 8 years,10,got ruined my 8 years. i don't recall anymore the time when i enjoyed this show. it ended so badly.
2019-05-20,govinddhruw55,End of my watch,10,"too much no. of people say samething so something wrong happen with its ending 😂😂, am also a great fan of these series then only for ending i'm not give lower ratings. just 1 for ending🤣 so it's end of my watch."
2021-10-14,masta_maze,What could have been the best show ever...,10,"...was ruined forever by the most incompetent writers in tv,history.seasons 1-4 were outstanding, they a great job in bringing the source material to the screen. casting was close to perfect, visuals were great, i couldn't wait for each new season and watched all episodes twice.seasons 5-6 were already flawed, even someone who hasn't read the books probably could tell where they ran out of source material. the books and the first 4 seasons worked that well as they were all realistic in a fantasy setting. sure there's dragons and some kind of magic, but characters made wrong decisions and they suffered the consequences up to their death. the best example for the flawed writing within these two seasons is invincible aria. the plot armor became strong here the rules of the world did not matter anymore. whilst super strong khal drogo died of a small infected wound, aria easily survived getting stabbed multiple times, drain the open wounds in dirty water, heal herself super quick and kill the waif. yeah. and that's just one example for the stupidity starting here. another one is jon snow, running against ramsays army in full plot armor and surviving with ease. but hey, at least we had great battlle scenes.season 7-8 went full hollywood. i guess even michael bay and roland emmerich could have written better scripts. the realism within the fantasy setting was gone. it's nearly impossible to describe the level of stupidity that was going on in these seasons. the complete change of character's behavior. tyrion becoming a complete moron. jon snows increased plot armor that let him survive in ice water after fighting the whole army of white walkers. the stupidity the worst episode ever beyond the wall. the anticlimactic finishing of the white walkers story arc. the ending. that horrible messy ending.in summary: the series is ruined forever. even the perfect first seasons are unwatchable, as everyone knows where it ends. i really hope d&d never get hired for anything anymore."
2017-06-22,lorelaj2002,I wonder why you people like it so much?,10,"so much violence, and especially violence against women, and yet in this modern world, where we live, and most of us stand for democracy and human rights, so many people like this show. please, tell me why. i don't want to add any spoilers, but every woman in this show is so much degraded, even if she was made strong in the first place. ant that makes me even more curious of why would someone like it, except some people who hate women.. but i just cant believe that the world has so much of those.."
2020-01-11,ksharp-225-940568,Pretty boring,5,"not sure why this show is rated so high. it's dull and boring, long and painful, and not in a good way."
2018-04-25,little_miss_sunshine_44,Everyone dies but it still amazin,7,"yah sooo basically everyone has sex, and then dies in some twisted way, even the animals (especially the animals). it's an amazing show tho, and that's proven by the fact that all the fans still watch it religiously(and on repeat) even tho we cry basically every episode. 
if you find it too convoluted to follow, ya stupid. not the shows fault, you just slow. sorry. 
rip hodor, a death the world will never forget."
2020-10-17,babywyatt30,"Let's Face it, This show was never really THAT good.",10,"during corona lockdown i really got an opportunity to reflect on the show as a whole and think about the experience. i started & finished game of thrones about a month before the 8th season aired. i kept hearing about this show plus i'm a fan of fantasy and an even bigger fan of period peaces so i definitely wanted to see what all the fuss was about.the experience: right off the back i could tell that there was no way i would have stuck with this show week by week when it originally aired. it was almost too much of a slow burn, providing just enough intrigue to click on the next episode. without knowing any book specifics it takes awhile to understand what type of world you're in. the show seems to play out as if you should already know the lore and charaters motivations. remember, this show didn't start getting heavy mainstream buzz until around season 3 and continue to trickle in through season 6. by the end of season 6 it was a mainstream hit! point being, i believe this show was a better binge then it was a week to week & ratings support that theory. the books have pov chapters that give insight on character motivations, the show never did a good job of displaying or verbalizing what they were exactly....again, just enough to click next episode. i agree that season 5 felt completely random even as a binge so nothing to discuss there. then you get to season 7 where things really pick up.... at this point it's a little jarring because a lot is happening but nothing that moves the story along much and the dialogue felt incomplete; because of this a lot of the actions didn't quite make sense. by season 8 it was more of the same with even less useful dialogue & made worst by a landslide of unanswered questions.conclusion: i feel like this show suffered the most from lack of communication with the actors. foreshadowing works best when the actors know what their foreshadowing. unfortunately shock factor was more important. too many plots left unresolved & not enough exposition where there should be.i'm one of the unfortunate souls that got caught up in the hysteria while hypnotized with grand cinematography & pretty dragons. i don't regret it one bit! this was still a good show, but it was never a great one."
2019-05-16,mahmoodshamal,Perfection,1,"amazing series, after got my life will be before got and after got"
2021-10-14,prafulgaur,What is this hate all about.,10,what kind of ending did you folks were expecting . i guess after season 1 this was the best kind of ending that was got but nevermind. it ain't a fairytale still finished on a good note where things should have been ended. great series 10/10.
2019-05-14,bthourigan,The last season has put a serious dent on the rewatchability of this show.,10,"is it the best tv show of all time? no, mainly because the denouement/final stages of the shows story arcs are too rushed.compared to a show like breaking bad which has two phenomenal last seasons (with a few little bumps) game of thrones was ""phoned,in"" by the producers/writers.for what it is worth, below is my overall rating of the tv show and a breakdown of each season. as you can see in my opinion the show hits a crescendo with season 4 and then unfortunately drops. in the latter seasons there are some incredible episodes and major spectacle but the show loses the run of itself due to rushed conclusion. the final season is almost a 101 of what not to do with a television series' final season aggregates of my episode ratings by seasontotal series: 8.16season 1: 8.9season 2: 9.0season 3: 9.1season 4: 9.2season 5: 8.8season 6: 8.6season 7: 7.7season 8: 4.0"

2020-02-13,raviparnani,1 number minus for season 8,10,"each and every scene is epic....it is not a show for me...it has become another world where i like the others get lost in. but when it comes to season 8...after so many tries, i couldn't get connected to it as it was very boring and bad like the writers were just thinking to get rid of it anyhow.
it is like a relationship which is very interesting in the starting but end is always bad."
2021-07-09,ritikchawla,Ratings only valid till S7,1,"season 6 ended on such a high note, what happened afterthat was a tragedy to this wonderful creation of a show."
2019-05-22,daveconsalvi,Greatest series of all time cheapened by final season,7,"i've watched game of thrones 4 times and, like millions of people in the world, was extremely excited for the last season to find out what would happen to all the characters we've spent many years getting to know. what happened, although not without merit, being beautifully shot, acted, produced, clearly with a large budget and absolutely stunning music, seriously dented the show's credibility and rewatchability. the material left required 2 seasons minimum. there was simply no justification cramming everything into 6 rushed episodes that left so many unanswered questions, plot holes and required the viewer to completely suspend disbelief in order to reconcile scenes.winter is coming! the mantra repeated constantly for 8 years. well it came and how long did it last? a day? jon snow wasn't even wearing a coat! we could do with a few more winters like that in the uk as it would save me money on heating!there's only one war that matters, the war between the living and the dead. let's get that finished in one evening so we can move on to more important things. you three stand over there and hold off huge hordes of the dead while arya makes her way through the dead army and kills one guy whose death finishes everything. he probably should've maintained a safe distance to prevent his army being defeated but he absolutely had to get to bran. why? who knows.ok, the great war is over. now it's the last war. good thing we can finish that in half an hour with one dragon and zero casualties. seems a bit silly spending 7 seasons getting an army and ships etc together when all she needed to do was get an air b&b outside king's landing and wait for drogon to get big enough.danaerys is dead. poor dothraki. what do they do now? may as well go on holiday with the unsullied.so what's the deal with bran? he must be up to something with his time travelling and mystic powers. oh, he actually is just a weirdo. let's make him king so we don't get into trouble with the anti discrimination people.hang on, we haven't had enough time to squeeze all your favourite characters into the series. let's just stick them all on the small council so you can see them one last time.i expected to feel flat as it's always disappointing when a great series finishes. although d&d were geniuses for bringing this show to tv in the first place, it's desperately disappointing that they lost interest just at the most crucial moment. game of thrones will always be a great show, but it could've been the greatest ever. an opportunity missed and a massive disservice to all the cast and crew who clearly put their hearts and souls into its creation, not to mention the fans who also deserved better closure. a real shame."

negative : dint find any except, can't be watched with family"
2019-04-22,markjgriffin,Believe the hype,10,spent years putting this off then watch all 7 seasons in the 2 months running up to season 8. so glad i did! epic viewing!
2019-05-20,hasnainafzal,Amazing season which is ever made,10,got is a season which is one of its kind. game of thrones is a piece of human history. game of thrones has changed my life. every season have a thriller but ending is very sad. dany doesn't deserve such kind of death .
2019-05-17,dmgaskell-12765,Perfect then ruined,10,"i had read the books years before the series came out and was a bit dubious about how it would translate to the screen. i then saw hbo were doing it which eased my worries as they make some superb programmes, and when i finally got to watch it, it is superb from the first scene.excellent casting, acting and staying close to the books this was the best programme on tv for years!the problem is the series overtook the books and since then it has gone downhill, especially the final series. there is a massive battle which should be incredible but i found it a real let down, and the episodes after this are even worse. these characters that have been so well developed over the years suddenly act in ways that are just bizarre, i'm incredibly disappointed, i doubt george r r martin had much to do with the scripts/plot and i'm sure he can't be happy with the result. 10/10 for the first few seasons, 3/10 for the last one.there were also a couple of things in the previous season which were a big letdown, like explaining where the bad guys came from, and some characters were massively underused, or their story arc just seemed to tail off when the had been so promising.overall definitely worth watching but prepare yourself for disappointment towards the end."
2019-05-21,qutaiba_zz,Bad ending of all time,9,it was the greatest until season 8 destroyed everything
2019-07-05,avey-84698,Absolutely stunning!,9,"words cannot describe how much i love this show. watching it was probably the best decision i've ever made, and i will never regret any of the hours i spent on this show. the characters, the storylines, the plot twists,... everything is beautiful and all so well pulled together by wonderful music and stunning scenery. game of thrones pulled at all my heart strings at once; it made me smile at the triumphs and victories, and it made me cry at the devastations and losses. the writing is spectacular, and i got chills with almost every episode.
you won't regret watching game of thrones, i promise you."
2019-07-05,avey-84698,I had to write two reviews,1,"i had to write two reviews because i just wanted to express that game of thrones is simply so enjoyable because it's not a kids show. it's not. it's a well thought,out show with characters that have so much depth, personality, and structure that it really makes you feel as if you are in the show with them. you lose people that you never thought you'd see losing, and the bad guys just keep getting more bad. and the situations are all so brutally realistic. no, the 'good' guys can't always be the winners. no, everything isn't always black and white. no, not everyone is always safe and happy and healthy. no. game of thrones shows you what is real and what is gripping and dark. this show took me through a whirlwind of emotions and storylines, and i wouldn't have taken back a second of my time spent on this show.
10/10, the best show i've ever seen."
2018-07-30,loinaa,JUST AMAZING and best TV show ever made,10,"i mean come on... i think i don't need to say how good game of thrones is. but damm this series is just incredibly good! i actually didn't read the books first. i have to say that when i saw the pilot i was a little bit sceptical about the series. i thought it was another one of those medieval series. but it didn't take me very long to realize that this series was different. first of all the quality of the series (music, filming, acting..) is really incredible, which is actually quite understandable when yu see their budget. one thing i really love on the series are the accents and the languages. they make the serie so enjoyable to watch and also ( now that i read the books) i can say that the way they talk is pretty similar to the books. since i'm talking about the books: many series that are based on books are never as great as the original story and are critisized for cutting out a lot of important things and not keeping the same athmosphere. but i have to say that the producers did an amazing job on not disappointing the bookfans. the book and the series are equally good in my opinion. to end this i also wanted to point out how unpredictable got is. i think thats also what makes it so great and why we are al still thrilled after 7 seasons. in most tv shows you can easily predict what happens but in got you rarely know who's going to survive the next episode. at least after the red wedding you realize you can't be attached to your favorite characters for too long... because you never know when they might die...! can't wait for season 8 to come out!!!"
2019-05-21,marcusnichols,Heartbroken,9,"i've enjoyed watching the fantastic cast bring game of thrones to life. i have huge respect for all the actors for their portrayals of the characters, they have been brilliant. seasons 1,6 were great... 7, ok, but season eight, the jewels on game of thrones' crown get written. as with everything in life, it could turn out any which way... and the writers decide to tie it up like they do. i feel for fans of the show that waited like i did for every season, every episode, but i am most of all bitterly disappointed for the cast who didn't get the conclusions they deserved."
2019-11-11,abhijitmhasagar,the show is good till 7th season,9,"the ending is disgusting , i dont know who written the script of ending... its like a bollywood movie that i least wanted at the end of the movie/show"
2020-04-10,hsherlock-77919,All time best show,10,"the best tv show till date .i think it's matchless tv series and best cinematic achievement ever. great storytelling and character development combined with amazing visuals. every frame is a work of art, almost every frame is a masterpiece. overall, this show is simply beyond compare. in game of thrones, you will find everything you want, from the importance of family, to politics, to brutal, realistic war, romance and so much more. the character development, costumes, plot and twists are on point and simply phenomenal.
the storyline is full of unpredictable surprises which leave you scratching your head and craving for more. every season has its own set of twists and turns which keeps the audience entertained, thrilled and glued to the screen till the last episode. also, it's though it falls under the fantasy genre it has great humor, good action seen, plenty of romance, humongous amount of politics and lots more. although in season 8 the ending was quite tragic but seems a little dissapointing.
it's definitely a must watch show and shouldn't be missed #gameofthrones"
2017-05-24,ahmadmdradi-83663,Must watch.,9,"when you have a story like this, where the author created his own world and let his imagination reach the limit, you need production that will be generous to the limit. hbo has made a masterpiece that took tv to a higher level. no matter who you are, you will enjoy this show. fantasy, drama, suspense, action, war, romance... heroes, villains and villains that become heroes... angels that die and demons that linger on... this story just takes you everywhere. i was really amazed how they could include so many characters, each having a detailed history that is very well created. as i was amazed how the casting was so perfect.. none of the actors, no matter how small there role is, could be replaced. peter dinklage, lena heady, nicolaj coaster,waldau, sean bean, michelle fairley... kit harrington, iwan rheon, alfie allen, richard madden... maybe they have all been critically acclaimed, but i would like to praise the brilliant performance of stephan dillane, i would literally watch his scenes twice. the whole series is super, but ""battle of the bastards"" i think is the best television production in history. the only thing i would criticize is the overdose of nudity and sex that wasn't at all needed, i believe that 90 percent of the nudity could've been avoided. totally this is a must watch show. can't wait for the 7th and 8th seasons."

2019-07-14,twilightone,Superb Ending,10,"i liked the ending where jon is not the king of 6 kingdoms, the writer choosed bran the broken as the king. its daenerys targaryen who sacrificed everything & jon killed her so sending him to the wall is a good decision."
2019-05-27,griffingodno,Disappointing yet worthwhile,8,"i am giving a good review to the series as a whole, even the though the ending was quite disappointing. i can no longer call it the best show ever anymore because the last two seasons were very rushed. it's not where they ended up, it's how they got to those points. i wish grrm had stayed on the show. d&d are not as strong as him writing wise, and seasons 7&8 show it. again, even though it could've ended a lot stronger, i still wouldn't not recommend it. it is still very good overall."
2019-05-05,madcaesars,"Great show, bad ending.",1,this is an amazing fantasy series with some exceptionally good moments but the ending was just bad. disappointing.
2019-05-25,osberttheavenger,*sigh*,10,"disappointed to put it mildly. disappointed. upon rewatch of the show it'll be difficult to enjoy it the same way that i had in the past, due to the knowledge of where it'll all end up. one of the greatest stories in television history, ended like a wet fart."
2019-05-22,aliabinjubeir,Omg,1,one of the best shows i will ever see in my life it's so amazing and literally i can't find words to describe it

2018-12-28,juliana_rose,WORTH WATCHING,10,"this series is very much worth watching, but you can't jump in and think you'll figure out what's going on..you need to watch from the very first episode and pay attention! you won't regret it!"
2020-04-19,garymcintosh-49778,Best show ever,5,season 1 starts out slow but a few episodes in and you are hooked. my whole family loved watching the new episodes each week. the only thing disappointing about the show is that it ended.
2019-05-20,cheme_md00,Don't bother watching,10,"i feel like i wasted my time on this show. nothing gets answered in the end of the show and so many plot holes. season 8 is the worst season i've ever seen on tv. seriously, don't waste your time. read the books and save yourself the disappointment."
2018-12-21,falanukki,"Winter isn't coming, it was here all along",10,"i finally caught up with everyone to see the legendary game of thrones myself. i'm intrigued to see how the story folds in the final season in the following spring.i watched this series without the actual hype train, which i believe to be a good thing. game of thrones is a strong player in the genre of fantasy and mystical creatures. it has some strong characters and interesting, complicated plot lines.however from the very beginning of the show i had a hard time finding my favorite characters. i don't know if it's because of the ruthlessness of the era or just the fact that the milieu is so far from my own reality , i couldn't find anyone to like. the characters are mean, hyper sexual and somewhat blank. although the acting work in game of thrones is amazing, i feel some of the characters fall kinda flat - but that's for the writing to blame in my opinion. also due to the short lifespan of the characters i found it hard to get actually attached to anyone.some of the episodes are too slow for my taste and there are a couple of scenes that are made with unnecessary gore.game of thrones is a strong drama with a unique and intriguing plot. it has its flaws and you might benefit watching it with someone who already knows what's going on (ie. has read the books or watched the series at least once). the relations of the characters are a total chaos and you'll probably struggle with memorizing the places and families for the first two seasons... let alone adding up all the magic and creatures to this whole mess.game of thrones is something i'd watch once. i won't go back to it, but i recommend it with a hand to my heart. (and don't worry, even i found my own favourites after season 7)"
2019-01-04,clairefawn,Best show ever !!,10,"i don't think there will be a show as good as this for a very very very long time , got is the only series have watched all season over and over again it so addictive as soon as i finish i start all over from season one it that damn good!! no other series or movies even come close to how incredible the show is ."
2019-07-21,savary-89322,Breaking Bad is 1000x Better!,10,"anyone who says this show is better than breaking bad hasn't seen it. it's just all around better. this show is for huge dorks and fans of movies like lord of the rings. it clearly shows that breaking bad is a higher rated show, so it's obviously better."

2019-05-17,omarkaseem,Greatest show of All time !,10,"the best show you could ever watch, a masterpiece!!"
2019-04-29,nilsbrandstaedter,This used to be a 9/10 rating,8,"a lot of people will tell you that game of thrones is an epic high fantasy series, unmatched in production power and acting, as well as casting and writing. and this used to be true. got used to be one of the best shows the world had ever seen. complex, interesting characters and plotlines in a rich, detailed world. it used to for around five seasons.this show has changed and while i didn't mind (even as season seven became downright ridiculous), i didn't mind for a reason.game of thrones had the chance to reveal something deep, something meaningful and humble about the world we live in, about power and about sacrifice. the way it was crafted was designed to climax in a finale that would hold a revelation inside. something to take away.now, as the last season airs, this possibility has faded. it's spectacle and it looks as good as a few hundred million dollars can look on,screen. but the story it tells is not longer important. it has become the antithesis of what it opposed. generic high-action fantasy. i highly encourage everyone to watch the first few seasons of this show, they are some of the best television ever made, including some of the best performances of our time. and if you have seen them, you will want to see the last three seasons too. and at first, you will notice small things, but they don't matter that much. but these things eventually become big and blatant and the question the books may answer in the end? they don't matter.i have seen more complex youtube videos theorizing about this show becasue, early on, you could do that. little things meant a lot and details would become major themes. you can still do this now, but the fact of it is, that the writers don't put as many effort in the scripts as the people imagining the impossible. most theories are based around the fact that this show used to be everything but generic. everything could happen. now, it has become generic. and things just... kinda happen. it hurts to rate something this way that used to be better than the most. but we have been spoiled with good tv in the last years and got doesn't compare to things like breaking bad anymore. even though i wish it did."

2019-11-22,rubenvanheerdenzz,Amazing Series but Sadly....,9,"originally gave it a 9.7/10 for this series. this series was always competing for number 1 for my favorite series of all time.it was either this or avatar the last airbender which was a 10/10 for me.alright, let's start with the review.the positive side.gave it a 7 but actually, it's a 7.5 because of the number of seasons there actually are within this show. season 1,7 was amazing but don't get me wrong season 8 does have good acting, good cgi, and amazing environmental shootings but the battle was horribly done for winterfell. you couldn't see anything. my 4k tv couldn't even show me where the dragons were. the actors truly gave it their all. which should be probs to them. the negative side.obviously, something happened behind the scenes because even a child could write better than david and dan for what they did in season 8.they destroyed the following within three episodes:1. jamie's redemption ark.
2. tyrion intelligence
3. daenerys intelligence
4. daenerys character development by making her mad queen??
5. jon snow by giving him literally three sentences.""your may queen.""
""i don't want it.""
""it's yours.""yeah, that's all that your main hero says within the final season which is just.... unreal.basically destroying everything that was busy being built throughout the whole series.you made the greatest threat known to man being killed by a butter knife while none of the other thousands of weights or white walkers saw her?? i mean?? where is the consequence? where is the epic finally this series was building towards to?i mean i don't care for bitter endings but please make them realistic. azora ahai would have been an amazing, emotional and poetic ending.but when daenerys died i felt nothing because in my eyes it was a complete stranger and that is actually how i felt for all the characters within the show within its final season but i'm not going to get my emotions to judge the true beauty of what this show originally stood for.thank you, hbo for making this series. it's just such a damn sad thing of what happened to its last season.9.7/10 - 2.2 for its bad writing for its final season which is usually the conclusion to every saga.my rating is 7.5/10 for the whole series overall.ps. the finale season really destroyed any marathon for anyone actually. so i would say the rating should be fair.now i would rather recommend for you to rather watch.avatar the last air bender

2019-05-07,psaurabh-26390,Season 8 ruined GOT,7,"bb and got thaught me its not important how u start a tv series but how well you actually end it. vince galligan made it sure bb stays the best. bb started slow/boring with its 1st 2 season bt the pace after it was mind blowing and the way it ended was awww,some. whereas coming to got 1st 4 season were 11/10 bt once d&d took over they ruined it. the end was not supposed to meant this way. i am here after the last seasons 4th episode heart broken after giving these many year to got and the end u get its literally disappointing. had a doubt between bb and got which is best so after gots season 8, bb for sure remains the best of best series in this world :)"

2019-07-19,matthewfogarty-89432,"Amazing Beginnings, Disappointing End",9,this show's biggest problem is the writers do not know how to end it.
2019-05-15,bakrybaso,BEST TV SHOW,1,"game of thrones is the best tv show of all time for many reasons. it contains actions, fantasy, speaches and intelligent idea based on the book ""the song of ice and fire"""
2020-08-09,kevinmorales-05055,Worse than Red Wedding,1,"whole season 8 was more gut wrenching than the episode of red wedding, only difference is, red wedding was actually written good."
2019-05-25,smallestdude,"Bar season 8, its easily the best TV show of all time",10,"d&d fked up big time with season 8. but aside from that i really enjoyed the rest of the show. season 1,6 was amazinngggg
season 7 was a bit meh, but it still felt like game of thrones
season 8 feels very much like an average hollywood knockoff of game of thrones, rushed with no real feelsi was gonna rate this 8/10, but i rewatched bits of seasons 1-6 the other week and realised that i would be unjust to those masterpiece seasons to rate the show anything under 10."
2019-09-25,orestisgsiskas,Disappointed,1,the final season was so bad with the death of dany and what happened to jon. the writing too was bad but still is the best show out there only cause of those 7 first seasons. and who has a better story than bran (wtf does that even mean). they ruined it all.
2019-05-30,shithappenzz,The Best Show... Or it Was.,2,"i started this show, i hadn't got a lot hope but i started anyway. first season, i started to love the character; ned stark. and guess what... he died at the end of the season.
second season, i started to love renly baratheon and he died at the end too.
third season was the saddest season ever... i still burst into tears when i remember what happened to the great house stark. i loved robb, catelyn and hause frey slaughtered them viciously. i cried a lot in the red wedding. and of course we can not forget what happened to jeor mormont, who is the most honorable man in the seven kingdoms (after eddard stark obviously), and he got murdered by the men who he would protect and defend in any kind of situation.
at the fourth season, i had 2 favourite characters left; tywin lannister and ygritte. they both died. it really broke my heart. especially ygrittes' death scene was so perfect that it moved me to tears :(((what i'm trying to say is it was really good written in the first 5,6 seasons and after george r.r. martin left, it was like d&d didn't knew what to do and what to write so they made up the whole scenario. there is no other explanation. season 8 was poorly written and ridiculous. but yet, it's the best show of my life."
2019-05-22,schw0734,Game Changer,8,"yes, the ending was disappointing but that doesn't change the fact that this show upped the bar for anything to follow. definitely one of those ""just one more....ok, one more... one more than i'm going to bed, i swear!....i can get by with only 3hrs of sleep"".... and so on. it's not fair to knock a series down simply for a small piece of it not being up to par. the conclusion was disappointing, yes. but it was disappointing for got standards. plus it appears to be setting up some spinoff/sequels, which should be sweet.watch some of the youtube videos explaining the reasoning behind the end and it'll make some more sense.peace out!"
2021-01-09,aghawks,Outstanding... but that ending,7,"this series is impeccable. i don't want the review to be too long because it will look like an overload so i am going to try to fit all my emotions and feelings about this show into a couple paragraphsseasons 1,6 : absolute perfection. my favorite show of all time is breaking bad, but not even that show has what makes the entire got series so amazing, which is insanely stunning visual effects and production values. the writing. oh my god. amazing. the detail and time they put into every character in this series and the time they take to really make you feel connected to each and every one of them is amazing. keeping track of 9 different families times and 50 plus characters as well as this show does is baffling. overall snzs 1-6 is some of the greatest tv ever made easily. 10/10season 7 : still quite good but this is where the show starts to drop to a 9 star rather than a 10. the effects and cinematography stays unparalleled but you can tell a slight difference in character traits and a drop off in writing cores and values as it becomes a little sloppy and shady in some areas. i feel this show is as highly praised as it is because of the focus and detail that went into every aspect of it, specifically writing. but that starts to shift as, as said above, certain things you think would be unreasonable or just flat out wrong start to pop up. this is also where the show starts to be majorly rushed. 7 episodes was just enough to cover everything they wanted to in this season, but as said above, sans 1-6 were perfect because of the time they put into it. overall still a great season just not as good. 9/10season 8 : i don't think i can start this description off with anything other than saying... ""what the hell was that""?!?! i truly don't think this ending would be looked at as horrible as it is if it weren't for the show being as stellar as it was leading up to it. everything goes back to the god-forsaken writing. so many character arcs destroyed, plot points abandoned or missed, un-characteristic choices by many figures *ahem tyrion*, and holy hell, so so so so soooo rushed. i mean, i don't want to spoil anything but my oh my. this 6 episode finale should have been about 2-3 seasons of 20-30 episodes. an absolutly outstanding shows ruined by and absolutly awful ending, which honestly felt offensive more than anything. i never thought i could feel the amount of disappointment and pain from watching something as i did from this, but wow.in closing, amazing must watch series of course, but just prepared to feel unfulfilled and just flat out offended by the end of it."
2021-01-13,aghawks,Season 8 review ( spoilers ahead ),9,"text: this review is for the people the are feeling betrayed by the god,awful ending, and are looking for specific details, plot points, and character flaws in the outstanding drama series : game of thrones (spoilers ahead)character arcs/development : i'm going to start with one of if not my favorite character of the series, (jaime lannister) - this figure went from being one of the most despised people in season 1, to one of the more kind-hearted, courageous, and brave men in the series. his acts in season 1 were despicable, from pushing bran out of a window (paralyzing him for the series), to doing his own sister. but throughout the series, he is transformed into this character that we come to love. he sticks up for brienne and prevents her from being raped, rescues tyrion from his death by setting him free, leaves cersei to help khaleesi in the fight against the night king... all of this development is destroyed within one sentence , "" cersei is hateful, and so am i "". this is what he tells brienne before leaving her to go back to westeros to continue to do his sister. this just doesn't make any sense any way it's looked at. in episode 2, he apologizes to bran and says that he "" is not that person anymore "". his entire development through the series leaves the viewer quite frankly stunned, or at least it did for me. but his death, oh my god. i just don't understand how the writers could see that as a just death for him after all he'd been through. the fact the writers don't have enough creativity to give him a better death than just killing him and cersei by having rubble fall on them is pitiful. his character arc is a prime example of just how bad the writing is through this entire series. (arya stark) - while i admit the scenes with her were a little less interesting... her character was very unique and had so much unfulfilled potential. the very thing she trained for in becoming a faceless man was just left in the dust after the murder of walder frey. all the opportunities she has to use this ""skill"" throughout the rest of the series are endless... but instead, she basically becomes a ninja. they take her from being this widely developing character with a lot of internal change, to making it all about physical prowess. not to mention the killing of the night king. why on earth would they end that threat by having arya soar in out of nowhere just to stab him. i mean, the shows very first scene ever is of the white walkers... it just feels very unfulfilling. (cersei lannister) - i am going to keep this character review short. even though i despised her throughout the show, i hated her death. it was too quick and simple for how big of a role she played throughout the show. also hated how her entire role in this season was to stand at her window, sipping wine, looking over westeros. (tyrion lannister) - on of the cleverest, funniest, and most lovable figures in this show, turned stupid. he stands out in earlier seasons for the way he talks, his wittiness, his clever remarks and strategies... but in season 8, my god. in every way he advises khaleesi, it turns out to be for the worst. he makes the biggest mistake in believing in his sister when she said she would send troops of westeros to help khaleesi and her army in the battle against the night king. he believes this after verbalizing multiple times that she is untrustworthy, and after seeing first-hand all of the acts and dirty deeds she's pursued. it is just terrible to watch his character turns into. (jon snow) - ""you're my queen""... nothing to say about this but that he's one of my favorite characters turned just flat out dumb. also, the whole him being a targaryen thing... if he really didn't want the throne, then why would you tell khaleesi, and sansa, andddd arya. did he not realize how much trouble telling them that he is the rightful heir to the throne (when he doesn't even want to be!) would cause... all of his development throughout the show just to end back up at the night's watch, where they literally stabbed him multiple times killing him. just flat out disappointing.unfulfilling plots : the biggest thing wrong with the finale is the time they took to present it. this season should have been 2 seasons at least. the battle against the night king should've been more of a season finale kind of deal, especially with how much the show was built around the white walkers, but instead, the army of the dead is defeated at the halfway mark of the season. this was in my opinion one of the the biggest mistakes. you have hardhome, one of the highest rated episodes of the series (9.9), in which jon snow goes to try and secure some wildlings to help the night's watch. they are then attacked upon departure and many many wildlings are turned to the army of the dead. along with that, this is the army that killed one of khaleesi's dragons, and they're defeated in one of the most unrealistic, darkest, and i mean literary dark and hard to see episodes ever in the history of got.the defeat of that army should have been much more meaningful and realistic than it was. they send the dothraki into the wave of death that is the army of the dead, along with jorah, who surprise, is one of the only ones who comes back. prime example of what this episode is filled with, something we call: plot protection. how the hell do tormund, brienne, the hound, jorah, arya and a few more of the main characters somehow fight off waves and waves of dead people for about an hour straight?? multiple shots of someone being overthrown and drowning with white walkers on them, then suddenly poof, they're back to fight, unscathed. so many unrealistic aspects of this episode and the season in general, that are even more noticeable because of how realistic this show was for the previous 5-6 seasons. this is what the show thrived on was raw, real, meaningful and well thought out storytelling, but that was just completely abandoned in this season. the absolutely stunning and beautiful visual effects and production is just not enough to distract you from how poor this episode and season overall really is. also rip jorah (one of my favs throughout the show)khaleesi's downfall. words just cannot describe how disappointing it was watching her go from that woman who pursued the right thing constantly to the woman who destroyed westeros out of left field. she started off as the woman who was set on making the world better and better. she wanted to break the chains of slavery everywhere she went. she was this redeeming, courageous figure throughout the entire series. then, boom. she turns into the very thing she was bound to destroy. cersei decides to surrender westeros to her, but as we know, khaleesi decides to absolutely obliterate the city and all the people residing in it. this is so polar opposite to what she had been. there's no foreshadowing of this any way you look at it. no instance in the entire show had she ever made and indecisive decision like this, and to this magnitude. it makes absolutely no sense and it destroys everything this show built up. they set it up for a perfect ending in daenery's targaryen taking the iron thrown with jon snow by her side. finally, a true, just, right queen, but no. they unsettlingly and unreasonably destroy all of that in a split second, along with having jon snow kill her, and still not take the throne for himself. it is just flat out offensive that the writers could tear down a show like that and give the viewer such an unexplainable series of events. ending the show with ""bran the broken"" taking the thrown just left me feeling some sort of way that was indescribable honestly. just unexplainably pitiful imo. and as described above, the death of jaime and cersei, 2 characters in the show since literaly the very first episode of the very first season, was just so unfulfilling to watch.overall, i really do feel like this show provides some of the most gripping, shocking, and flat out amazing content available out of anything ever. but with that being said, an ending complimenting that feels necessary, and with the opposite of the being provided, it just left me and pretty much every other viewer disappointed and in shock in the worst way. overall i give this show a 9/10"
2021-05-03,sirhoraceslughorn,No No No No!!!!,10,"i just don't understand season 8, it blows my mind! why did daenerys turn evil, how did it happen to her? i just can't understand it and season 8 totally ruins game of thrones for me as it misunderstands daenerys massively. every time i've watched game of thrones since season 8 came out it's given me a headache due to trying and failing to figure out what went wrong with dany. bran never deserved what he got either, he was emotionless, boring and creepy so i don't know how the other characters managed to give him so much respect in the later seasons. i'm also disappointed at how underpowered the white walkers were in the end and was massively disappointed the white walkers didn't win and turn everyone including themselves into mindless rotten drones as i was cheering for the white walkers."

2020-10-18,kberrak,Amazing one of my favorite series💙💛,3,"one of my favorite series i've watched, many stories ,families, beautiful beginning with a bad ending 1 to 7 seasons are amazing till the last season daenerys & jon deserved better ending."
2020-06-12,theveduarcher,Game Of Thones: Closest To Perfection,6,"this show is damn near perfect.yes, i agree that the eighth season was not the best, and was by far the worst of them all, but people seem to love to forget that up until the final season, david and dan gave us one of the most popular, most critically acclaimed, and most respected tv shows ever.the acting was always brilliant. even in the face of bad lines or story beats, the actors in this series make it work as best they can, and they do it very well. the casting was done so well that to a lot of people, these characters are inseparable from they actor they are portrayed by. as someone who has read the books as well as watched the show, i can confirm this.90% of the time, the writing was brilliant and perfect. the writers created a story that, while being a retelling of a famous book of the same name, had its own unique twists and turns, and captivated millions of people worldwide for nearly a decade. that's nothing to scoff at. that's very impressive.cinematography, special effects, editing, directing, and all of the other things that make for a great show are done masterfully the whole way through. you just can't get enough of it. even in the earlier days of the show, when the budget was much smaller, the team managed to make it engaging, entertaining, suspenseful, dramatic, and all,around spectacular. the score done by ramin djwadi is incredible and iconic. all these things carried over from season 1-8 (besides the significant drop in writing quality in the last season).overall, this show is worth your time. i think that part of the reason so many people hated the final season was because, when you compare it to the previous seven, the writing took a major tumble. but if you look at it with an open mind, without the need to constantly compare and rank, it's an enjoyable season for the most part. but i agree that it's nothing compared to the ones that came before. game of thrones came so close to being the greatest show in history, and just a bit more effort could have gotten it there."
2021-02-08,carterdodds,Great until they rushed it,9,"so for all the people out there who don't read books, this show is based off a song of ice and fire by george rr martin. wich is still not complete, due to the fact of how much detail he has to put in, not to mention in the books he tells us a hole history wich he has to make sure lines up with the story at this point. anyways he is only on book 5, almost done 6, and each book is like a season of the show. when the show was on, only season 1,5 were george's work. then since there was such a demand for the show he had to sit down with db weiss and david benioff and tell them what was going to happen throughout the rest of the series and george said that he gave them ample info to get to season 11. so essentially db weiss and david benioff stuffed 6 seasons worth of info into 3 seasons, all of 6,7,and 8, wich is why the story did not flow like it did once before. so essentially i personally am rating seasons 1-5 10/10 no problem but 6-8 6/10"
2020-03-18,areolius,Worst ending ever,10,"first 5 season were outstanding, but last one is trash/ so do not waste your time"
2020-01-31,cwesten-60609,Seasons 1-7: Outstanding/Good Season 8: Terrible,10,"this series, in my opinion, is the greatest television series of all time. the dialogues, schemes, and battles made the show a success. if something went wrong/right for the characters and you don't know why it happened, just rewatch previous episodes and you'll see the seeds being planted for their demise/success. the only issue with this series is the final season. throughout seasons 1,6 nothing was rushed, while season 7 was rushed a bit it worked, but season 8 could've been expanded with a 9th season. this show could've been a 10/10 if season 8 wasn't rushed, but it was and yes that really is a bad thing for this show, therefore the show gets an 8/10."
2020-09-26,mccro-71419,"Great, but...",10,10/10 but final seasons keeps it from being in the conversation for the best.
2020-12-08,pitmalischi_larisa,Perfect from season 1 to 8,10,"i really didn't watch got untill december 2020 but saw a lots of tv series and beeing fan of fiction and history i must say it is a masterpiece! i mean you don't win so many awards by beeing average or doing it wrong! loved even the ending because it is a statement against what all that power may caused to ones mind ; great cast, great story, loved the ending even if jon doesn't get to be what he was destined to be and love the fact he proved to be more a wolf than a dragon. to all involved, thank you for the emotions ."
2020-04-13,kaustubshivkumar,The best show of this era,8,the way the story is told is very good. i watched all 8 seasons in 3 months. it's too good!!
2020-11-06,dheerajkulkarni,"1-6 seasons are fabulous, but 7-8 are quite disspointing",9,"the problem with last two seasons is, they doesn't feel like got, because the main theme of the show to vanish the most popular characters at any stage and just shock the audience was missing from it. in last season the death's of night king and dany
are seemed to be illogical and feels like writers were in a hurry to end the show and give happy ending.
but as a got fan we never wanted a happy ending,
as the unpredictable story line was the main reason for the popularity of the show, at last they just ruined it.
also at many stages the writer's favourite characters become immortal and it feels the night king was the weakest character of the story.
apart from last couple seasons, because of first 1,6 seasons the show is still on of the best shows ever."
2020-04-15,ja-48178,The best on TV Show ever,2,game of thrones is the best on tv show ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2020-12-04,zippelflorian,One of the best shows in history until the end of season 6,1,"season 1: 8/10 season 2: 9/10
season 3,5 10/10 (seriously the best seasons of any tv-show i have ever seen)
season 6: 9/10
season 7: 7/10 (felt worse tho bc the standards were extremly high)
season 8: horrible. can't rate it because you couldn't finish it. it was truly awful.in total unfortunately only a 8/10. could've been my favorite tv-show of all times but because of season 7+8 it sadly isn't."
2020-05-04,mpraveenkumar-73919,Worst . Final season is very worst. No one can make it as bad as this,9,"shame on the writers. you don't have value for characters. idiots . you spoiled everything because of last season .
i understand a series cannot satisfy everybody, people will accept if you give either happy or sad ending, but this one makes people thing that they have wasted their time all these years for this dumb last season.you just like that changed the character of people in order to end the season with a twist.
i hope they wanted a twist at that end so they spoiled the character like this .
everyone saying this is good and all justification given, but only after seeing ""ending explained on youtube and things said by the writers"", but as a viewer people should be able to understand on their own on seeing episodes alone.for example you changed the character of dragon queen just like that out of nowhere and projected her as a threat in a second . what is the logic in this (most hated change) . you call is writing .am never going the watch another series written by these people."
2020-07-03,hamzambappe,One of the best shows ever,1,"everyone has to watch , the story is amazing , the show is great and the characters are wonderful"
2020-08-20,laraibkhan-40707,Last season ruined it,8,well it started well until they ran out of material and started making things on their own. the last season ruined everything. perhaps george wasn't that interested. he has to sell books.
2020-11-04,jedimeisterinc,Confused on why I watched it,9,"when i first discovered the show i binge watched half of it but then stopped and never picked it up again. i still don't know why i got so into it or even watched it in the first place, because looking back i don't really care about any of the characters, or the story of the show. some character's plot lines were boring and unwatchable and the amount of weird unnecessary scenes made me either skip about 15 minutes per episode or nearly made me fall asleep."
2020-11-17,humhmd,I hate season8,7,season 8 was very bad but my favorite season is 4 season i love it so much just go and see it now
2020-12-16,mordenhrvy,Got is beautiful,7,what a series... i love it... i love vikings... and dragon🐉 ... i just watched only 1st season and i came for review
2021-06-17,fyauro,I'm still scares of watching this series,8,i'm highly addicted of this show. i know something ending was just biggest garbageical disaster but i have to love it.once i thought i'm only one here who is nothing doing here but everyone character in this series betrayed each other's then i realize i'm the one of them who being betrayed by this series of the end.for game of thrones.
2020-12-03,lycantrope-05240,Very dissapointed,8,this series was the best series ever but the last few season was horibble. the last season made me very dissapointed and angry.
2016-07-22,maxliv2003,"Brainwash, oh and spoilers",10,"the show is pretty entertaining, for most of the time, but i don't get it why people don't admit that after season 4, is just a major drop. by the end of season 4, some of the more interesting characters die( and the actors playing them really helped making them interesting) , ygritte, shae, oberyn, tywin lannister, joffrey , ned stark, robb stark, etcand you are then left with, for example, the awful arya storyline(the many faced god-cmon), the daenerys forever boring storyline which i never cared for since she is not that good of an actor to me, tyrion lannister is not that interesting anymore because he is not at the castle, jaime becomes kinda hmmm... even if i wanna like it.. he becomes dull , littlefinger with his annoying way of speaking, the religious fanatics at the castle - are you kidding, when the other kings smashed people just for fun, and then comes some random small group of people that all of a sudden has power over everything, that is pathetic in line with the show, the ramsay part is interesting at the beginning but after that i just think it takes to much unnecessary screen time and after season 4 seeing people just die over and over you just don't care anymore for no one, especially at the end of season 6. the jon snow storyline is still interesting, and there are still some good parts and really good characters in the show, but what remains tends to be more annoying.i think season 2, 3 and 4 are really great, season 1 has some crappy parts where everything seems to happen from the smallest reasons(the king dies from a boar, a boy just dies because arya played with him and joffrey is annoyed, bran is pushed from the tower and miraculously not dies, etc), well and season 5 and 6 are terrible for me, except for the battles and the great characters that still remain in the show (like davos seaworth, jon snow, bronn, brienne of tarth, jorah and maybe some bits of jaime, cersei, sansa, theon and maybe some other that don't come to mind just now)"
2021-01-09,genuinereviews,Unbelievable Series.,4,"wow!!! that's how i can sum this show up in one word after binging all 8 seasons in just two weeks. game of thrones is immaculately scripted, directed, acted and produced. for years i overlooked this series and questioned the legitimacy of all the hype. the medieval backdrop, with knights and dragons and whatnot, never appealed to me. let me tell you i was wrong to pass on this... so wrong!the show is so much more than what it seems , the characters, the relationships and the story really solidify it. game of thrones easily tops my list of all time favourites. do not pass on this show... you will be missing out on 8 seasons of unparalleled entertainment."
2021-10-16,harrypotter-15693,GOT THE GOAT🐐,10,this is the best tv show of all time with not a perfect ending but some ppl overreacts too much.........nxjdjdndbznsdnnddnbdbxxndjjdbdbxjdjddnnd.xhxhxjhx.bxjxjxnxnxbxbxbcbx.
2021-01-30,duraimurugan-16498,It may be satisfied with a happy ending,10,the full series until the last episode is outstanding . but the last episode ruins it all . the ending is still in the heart even after 3 days(a sad ending) . i couldn't able to watch any other films or series bcz of the sad ending . it melts our heart but i don't like it. bcz until last episode the series had a thrilling and joyful and happy and unexpected thing happening adventurous series. i felt bad when i began to watch last episode that the series is going to end and i'm going to miss it and i planned to watch it another time even though it got 73 episodes but the last episode mad me feel too bad bcz of the sad ending. but anyway it is fantabulous series so if you are planning to watch it just watch it or you gonna miss an outstanding series and have wasted a period of time in your life if you don't watch this . but watch alone as it got many sex scenes
2021-03-25,indianabond-14664,Early brilliance sadly overshadowed in the end by political correctness and being rushed,6,"the first 4 seasons were fantastic and looked all set to be one of the best shows ever made. sadly the writers, running out of book material and wanting to bow down to pc culture turned this one great show into what at the end was a bitter disappointment. season 8 was rushed and the last few episodes lost all sense of realism which is what made the show so special."
2021-01-26,islamsc1,Nice,10,"very spacial, the final season wasn't good at all but still the greatest series i have ever seen"
2021-04-30,timothykelvinlewis,A truest epic series... until the last season,8,"the writing, set design and character honour the books in a very profound way. this was on course to be up there with the sopranos as my favourite show. it is such a shame that they wrecked its legacy with a shockingly poor end to the series. i know endings are the hardest part but they should have realised how awful it was and reshot the whole thing during filming as the last season is simply a rushed mess. everything that comes before though is well worth a watch because it is awesome."
2021-06-02,lavleshshukla-14936,Marvellous Series,9,i can say honestly.i have seen one of the best series ever forever.my favrout character dinerias targerian as role of emila clark.
2021-09-03,roissetiawan-29015,Best Series i ever watched,10,this game of thrones simply the best books adaptation.
2020-11-01,ivan_matyus,Perfect in so many ways.,1,"absolut best, you will enjoy all episodes nevermind the critiques."
2019-05-13,mikeyb540,WOW! What a way to end GoT,10,"good job hbo. seriously! power, greed, ambition, and envy lead to rage and madness. compared to real life, this is how our human nature crumbled empires in history.
the way this is going, the good guys are becoming bad, the bad are becoming heroes. not your typical lotr ending... too bad for the rest of the low ratings for the last season. i guess people still expect flowers and stars into the sunset type of happy ending."
2019-05-01,stevieschultz924,Worst episode to date,8,"i was waiting for the coming doom that was the night's king. i have been anticipating how his hoard of the dead would overtake the land of men, the seven kingdoms, everything. i was given this disappointment.
i can't even say i'm mad, i'm just disappointed. go to your room."
2020-01-20,marcelnl1,Someone failed at their job,3,would have given it a 10/10 if the last season simply didn't exist. what a horrible horrible final season which is topped off with the worst ending this series could wish for. shame on the writers and producers for ruining an otherwise absolutely brilliant series.
2012-05-26,stabb666,Complex and Addictive,10,"never having read the books, and being pressured for months by my in,laws to see this, i had the very great pleasure of being able to watch the entire first season consecutively in one day.by the time it finished, i was checking the date for the second season to start, hoping it was tomorrow. sadly, i had to wait with the rest of the world.my first experience of george rr martin was back in the 80's with the wild cards series of books, which engrossed me with the way each character's story intertwined with the others, how events experienced from the perspective of one would be impacted upon others. to have many authors involved in developing separate characters each was a masterpiece of editing.to have a sense of uncertainty about what might happen next is a difficult thing to bring to any story, with most plot lines having been subjected to a standard format and the characters being stamped out copies of the common stereotypes.martin seems to have brought a great part of that early concept of straying from the norm to this world, with the unexpected twists following a far more intriguing storyline than the average tv show, where the big names always make it to the end of the episode with all of their parts intact.from epic scale ideas, and subtle (and at times not so) hints at a rich past full of the best kind of myths, we begin to see the weave coming together on several levels. the way in which personality traits of characters are maintained in the face of life and death decisions brings an authenticity to the progress of events.the separation of information that allows each thread to play out without being warped by events in another thread, that couldn't and shouldn't be known, is a key component in bringing drama to the table.besides all of that, the casting is good for the most part, and with believable performances it is easy to find more than one character to care about, to invest some emotions with and to hope for."
2019-05-20,g_bega,Disappointment,10,this was very good tv series until the final 2 episodes of final season. ending was so big disappointment. and trend of femminsm
2019-05-19,merrilyac,Mark my words.....,10,brianne will be pregnant!!!!! this way she will have the best of jamie! no way they can end the series without her being pregnant with his baby! can you imagine brianne a mom? mess with her kid and see what happens! this last season has been disappointing but as a whole i can't bring myself to give it less than a 10. i have loved this series for too long. i will be like d&d and make the pieces fit even if i have to break them! all the actors are top notch and the visuals are stunning. you will enjoy it up to season 8.
2019-03-01,colourofthelife,"Violence, gore, sex, nudity and rape.",4,"those are the words that describe this show very accurately. this also indicates what kind of people could possibly watch and like this show. a simple example, one of these 10 stars reviewers suggest that if you give this show 1 or 2 stars, it means you have no brain cells. so according to this "" genius "" , if you give this show a 10 star, you are brilliant, super intelligent bordering on prodigy. this does not only proves that those reviewers have a way below mediocre intelligence as well as they are extremely immature as they cannot even stand different opinions. they, hopefully, will learn to respect other people's opinions when they grow up. sadly there is nothing can be done for their "" super high "" intelligence. if they would watch fellini or antonioni films, they would know what i mean but then again, i bet they have never heard of these brilliant directors let alone watching their works.graphic violence, accompanying with gore, in this is used for cheap thrills with no real reason.sex and nudity are abundant , gratutious, contrived and forced merely to attract those who have brains way below where it actually should be.rape is extremely trivalised, normalised, eroticised and glorified. writers even put some rape scenes that do not exsist in the books. there is no adverse effect shown on rape victims let alone making them seek justice or revenge. one can say this is medieval age but it is not. there was not any dragon in this age. this is merely a fiction and they depict sexual assault and rape as if it is nothing and a form of sexual relationship.what most stroke me is that some of these so called "" actresses "" defend those to death. i know that actors and actresses are not the most intelligent sort but this is too much, even for actresses and actors.one of them say that nudity is integrated within story. well, no, when tits, p****** and butts are floating around, nobody cares what kind of point you are trying to make as all focus on these female meat. whatever emotion or message you are trying to convey is lost in the female flesh. if there were such a technology that can track gaze on the screen, thenit'd be obvious that tits, butts and p****** wpuld be most visited parts in these scenes and nothing else matters as soon as you show nudity and sex.another actress say that people criticise her showing tits and such but they do not criticise violence , blood or when heads blown off. lol this actress somehow believe that nudity and violence can be exchangeable and it is not. also one can be against both gratutious nudity and excessive violence at the same time which never occurs this actress. moreover, many people do not only ciriticise gratutious nudity and sex but these very same people also criticise violence. if this actress is so uncomfortinle of on screen violence, then why didn't she quit the show? she didn't, she won't because of only one reason, money.that very same actress also claims that you cannot have sex with bra in real life. well, yes you can if you don't have some sort of anatomical abnormality. yes, usually women take off their bra but not always, especially outdoors. this actress wnat sto say that sex and nudity happen in real life and we merely reflect this. then again, we do not see any penis or vagina or will this actress claim that people have sex without a vagina and penis?in the terms of filmmaking, no nudity is ever required or necessary. it is only necessary for ratings, profit and money because nudity and sex sell. producers and directors force actresses to disrobe themselves so that they could gain money and fame. actresses show their tits , p**** and butts for the very same reason. audience, mainly consisted of males, want to see female bits, thus it is a win,win-win situation. the only thing loses here filmmaking.another actress claim that those nude scenes are artfully done, lol. it is always the case, always integrated with the story, artfull, trusted directors, real life resemblances etc. etc. etc. well, any and every woman have these "" arts "". i show my tits, look at my ass and pussy, see my art? what a great artist i am !another one claims that it is part of acting, meaning, you are not a real actress if you do not show your tits, ass and pussy. then ingrid bergman, the best actress ever lived, and countless others were not a real artists because they never shown their bits, lol.i wish those actresses could have been honest and say that they do this just taking the role and eventually for money. this is why i respect porn actresses more than those so called "" actresses "". at least porn actresses are honest at what they do.of course got is not alone when it comes cheap thrills through violence and nudity. there are countless other tv shows and films use the very same tactic such as spartacus, vikings, the deuce, girlfriend experience etc. etc. etc. that's the trend nowadays in tv and cinema. throw tits, p******, gore, violence towards audience, then write a cheesy plot, you are good to go. the more excessive those are, the better response, box office and money you get.esme bianco was showing everything she got almost in every scene she was in. she was wondering around star nakedly all the time. then one day, she decided to not do any more nude scenes because she did not want to be known as mere tits and pussy but rather as an actress. what did the producers do? well, they fired her, lol. if you do not show your flesh, you have no place in this show, or most of the cable tv shows. talk about gratutioussness.one may think i am religious and prude but i am not at all. i am even atheist. i'm merely talking about explotation, objectification of female flesh and filmmaking. anyway."
2019-04-16,congamabongo,"A game of talent, time and business - the fall of a giant",1,"this review, hopefully adding a unique insight, is about slipping quality of game of thrones, from the flawless 1st to 4th seasons. to the excellent 5th,6th, where source material was thinning and signs were showing of uncertainty. to the 7th and 8th seasons, where there has been an obvious drop in the quality of the show.essentially the prime, and mostly obvious reason for the fall of this show is that the creators have been forced to deviate away from the source material, due to that fact that there wasn't anymore. the quality that has taken martin years to painstakingly forge, now has to be created by a team of hollywood heads who have had formulas pumped into their brains as to how to write an engaging show. in their defense, the show runners are trying to create a standard of writing in the space of a year that is not possible.but the primary problem not that, it is that these producers of the show have set and ending schedule. they have had to write out a way that this show will end. this means that plot points will have to be carefully mapped out and that character behaviour and motive will have to align with how the producers plan to end the show. this is the biggest mistake they have made. on the other hand george r. r. martin has constantly driven the story through the character's behaviour and motive. the characters were so real and so believable and so deep because they were not locked into a narrative. the story was so engaging, because, like the people driving it, it was unpredictable. people are so complex, we never know how they are going to react or behave. we look at all of the pressures and circumstances that martins characters were under, and we see why they made the decisions that they made. the story was shaped this way. it had a beautiful organic nature about it. once martin's source material was exhausted, the writers not only had to substitute their own limited imaginations over that of a genius, but they had to do it in a very short time. more importantly they made the mistake of wedging characters into plot points. character motives and actions now secondary. their depth, and potential influence on the story now brushed away with insincere dialogue and actions in order to fit their long establish role into the the plot box that has now been predetermined for them. that is where the wheels came off this masterpiece, sadly. simply, put, the plot was put before the characters. the rushed finale of the show was unavoidable given that the books weren't finished and actors age. on a positive note, the show on it's own merit is still good, i still like it, albeit with an ever present disappointment in what could have been. the sets and costumes are as magnificent as ever. but if i'm right the potential for a quality got prequel is very high, there is hope!"
2012-03-03,medievalfantasy,Game Of Thrones- You Win or You Die,10,"words cannot describe how amazing this show is. if you love medieval fantasy and are a huge fan of the ""a song of ice and fire"" series, this is definitely a faithful adaption.as mentioned above, the series is based on the fantasy saga ""a song of ice and fire"" by new york times bestselling author george r.r. martin. each book has reached number one or close to it, respectfully. set in a world reminiscent of medieval europe, where winters can span decades, and summers can last a month, noble families vie for the iron throne and kingship over westeros.the first season is phenomenal, and conveys mostly everything from the first book in the series, ""a game of thrones"". every actor chosen fits the character so well, you believe they are their character. sean bean, my favorite actor of all time, is phenomenal is eddard ""ned"" stark, the protagonist of the first book. he conveys the emotions in ned perfectly, and he the scene where.... well, i won't spoil anything for you. it is really hard to praise just one actor with this show, as everything feels so believable.the sets and props are outstanding. each weapon, each piece of clothing, has such detail, you just want to pause the show and look at it up close to admire the craftsmanship that went into such work. the sets, beautiful. northern ireland and malta are the perfect places for this show to be filmed in. every environment looks so natural, and fits the books very well.now the special effects for a show with a budget of %50 million or so are.... honestly, i can't find words to describe how amazing they are. want to know how real they look? go to youtube and search ""game of thrones visual effects"".if you are a fan of the books of medieval things in general, this show is definitely worth checking out. some say it starts off slow, and yes, it somewhat does, but you will not be disappointed, since the show is only going uphill from here as it suits up for its second action packed season. winter is coming, and by the seven, i hope it continues to stay."

2019-05-27,mk3825,3 Episodes Killed 8 Seasons of Awesome,9,"the last three episodes killed the re,watchablitity for me since now i know that none of the foreshadowing or prophecies meant anything. it like they wanted it to be so unguessable that they just said, ""ok, who is the least person you would expect to be on the iron throne, we will just throw out 8 season s of character development and put him on anyway.""eight seasons, and three episodes were great. i loved when arya killed the night king, but i didn't realize then that it was the beginning of the end. anyway, my plan was to watch the final episodes and then go back and binge watch the whole series, now that i know how it ends, and pick up all the foreshadowing and know why people did the things they did., but after everyone broke character and just decided to do whatever at the end, none of that matters. where is the prince who was promised? what did the lord of light want? what does the night king symbols mean? why did it matter that jon was aegon, just so he could ride a dragon in the final episodes? bran didn't want anything until all of a sudden, king, they should have made hot pie the king. it would have made as much sense. anyway, it's like finding out that someone you looked up to for the last ten years turned out to be a charlatan. this show could have been epic."
2019-06-02,mk3825,G.R.R.

2012-08-19,rpessm,Leaves me wanting,10,"the real trouble with this show ,- game of thrones -- is that if you compare it to a show like boss -- which is about loyalty just as much as game of thrones, but boss is arguably current day and therefore has an astonishing measure of ""real"" application to our current political environment and current core political issues -- is that it is a fantasy. admirers of the tv/cable show game of thrones are so admiring of the show -- per having read many positive reviews -- precisely because it depicts the fantasy/fantastical story presented in the fantasy book so well. but the book is a fantasy. with so many admirers of the fantasy, a thinking/questioning person begins to wonder why all this ""reach"" and marvel into what even the author of the fantasy contends is fantasy that quite literally has little to do with our current times -- other than the predictable traces of ""human nature?"" i watched the first two episodes of the series and thought okay...it's okay as a story told...but there is really very little to be learned about mankind that we cannot discern from one day's daily newspaper from a large international city -- or a single issue of the economist; who's in trouble now...and why? i suspect the rigorous and dedicated followers of this show need to be shown a ""world"" that is a distraction, not a distillation, of the more concrete world in which we, the living, live...to be shown a world without the current manifestations of political ambivalence and upheaval, the forces of political expansion and contraction, and most of all, political jeopardy and the individual's political polarization. but this is why i give game of thrones a 2-star rating; it is no real help to any of us now...it's simply a distraction. more soberly, why aren't we all wondering why we have been invited to watch the spectacle of slow economic meltdowns of the so-called piigs of europe, all predominantly catholic nations, without learning of any public, notable financial assistance from the vatican? let's define loyalty, really,...and for real. in addition, the cgi is strangely amateurish and the soft-core seemingly purely ""eye-candy""; plaudits for so unsubtly targeting the 15-35 male audience to boost the ratings -- just can't get more vulgar than that."

LIFE IS NOT OVER.,10,"people who hate on this show need to calm down in my opinion, with years of investment comes only the highest of expectation and when the result is short of perfection they give the episode a 1 star rating and go on to say how their life is now no longer worth living.yes the last season was rushed, and some decisions needed more time to justify them but even still, i give the show an overall rating of a 9.a 10 episode season would of surely given me the satisfaction needed to accept some things that have happened. i have no problem with any decisions in the last season, only the build up to those that should have been handled better.this show has the best story the best acting
amazing action scenes and battles
the best cinematography and score
the best costistancy in quality
its funny and smart and so much morewhat more do you people want?i feel sorry for those who are upset, but if it ended the way you thought, the other half would have a cry. this is got and well done to all who were involved."

there was so much character development, story arch, complexity. then, during the last 3 episodes, we get an 180, and everything that was developed in the last 7 seasons just didn't seemed to matter. i'm ok with the show changing narratives, but you need to take your time, can't rush it in 2 episodes. it's like if lord of the rings decided in the last 20 mins that aragorn was the real villian. i know there were little hints here and there, but that doesn't cut for me.anyways, it is what it is. just sad that a show that was suppose to go down in history as one of the greatest ended in disappointment instead."

2019-01-07,stalaro9,Fantasy as Fantasy SHOULD be watched!,5,"first thing i think you have to understand is that this is not earth being portrayed here! you can't say ""it was like that back then"" or compare it to the morals of earth human beings. it is utter fantasy and that is why you need an open mind to truly enjoy this series. it stretches your imagination, your limits of morals and right and wrong. that is the fantastic part about this series! in order to truly enjoy it you need to put your mind in the mind of each character and allow yourself to be a part of the show. then you can really get hooked into the show! then you can watch and enjoy each moment and episode by episode you will get pulled in deeper till you are biting your nails down to nubs till the next episode/season. when that happens, then you know beyond a shadow of a doubt...you are watching fantasy as fantasy should be watched! all hail to the throne...and whoever deserves to be sitting on it in the end!"
2019-05-08,vocalminority,What happened to the storytelling,8,"season 8 had all the hype....spoilers>>>>>>>years in the making, blah blah. the storyline is as if it was written by a group of children in their lunchbreak. the build up of the whitewalkers war fizzled into nothingness. i am up to episode 4 ,it seems that the story is just appers to be a vehicle for femisim, the dragon queen doesnt want to let john snow (the rightfull heir to the throne ) have the top job, he crumbles and like a besotted child gives all up for love, how ridiculous! arya stark (another woman) stabs the head whitewalker and kills him, whitewalkers gone......that was a letdown. now because john stark tells his sisters the truth and says swear not to tell a souls, why? because we are family???? they aren't family, hes the rightfull heir to the targarian clan. this story is rubbish. oh and then we switch to cersei (kingslayers girlfriend/sister) another strong and powerful woman, is going to destroy them all to get the iron throne! killing all her innocent subjects in the process....how dumb. oh and kingslayer is riding back to be by his sisters side after doing the big chick who he knighted???????? please get some intelligent storytelling back into this show in the last few episodes. and stop with the rampant femisim please."
2013-08-10,beatlefloydzeppelin,"Easily The Greatest Fantasy Television Show Ever, And Better Than Most Fantasy Films.",1,"before i start, let me say that i watched the first two seasons without reading the books, but after season two i was interested enough to read all five novels before season three. in this way i have the perspective of both a watcher and a reader. the purpose of this review is to help people decide whether or not this show is for them. a game of thrones (and the series of novels that it is based on) is somewhat unique in its story telling. although it is a fantasy world, it is more based on our actual history than previous fantasy writings such as lord of the rings. it is also very dark, depicting many events that would have (and often did) take place in our own medieval time period. for these reasons, it is very difficult for some viewers to get into the series without previously reading the books. after reading some of the more negative reviews here, i feel the need to clear up some of the main criticisms. there seem to be three major complaints:1. it is too slow. do not make the mistake of thinking that this is an action show. while there is a lot of fighting, it is often split up between a ton of politics, history, and character moments. this is a political drama, and the characters come first. i for one really enjoy the ""slower"" moments and find the dialogue just as interesting as the battles. if you like constant action and battle sequences, this is not a show for you.2. too much violence and sex. this show is not meant for the squeamish. it deals with many themes that are normally shied away from. the violence isn't constant, but when it arrives it is realistic and gruesome. the blood and gore is meant to emulate real injury and death in order to add realism. there is also a lot of nudity and sex. i will actually agree that the nudity sometimes goes overboard, but again, the show attempts to represent reality, and sex and nudity actually happens in real life (if you can believe it). if you cannot handle nudity and violence, this is not a show for you.3. there are too many characters and plots to keep track of. yes, there are hundreds of characters, spread out over two huge land masses, each with their own back story, motives, and positions. there is a history to the world that stretches back thousands of years, with epic events and battles. and there are many different kingdoms, all battling to better their own political position. it is not impossible to fallow (as some reviewers will have you believe), but it does require some time and patience to understand all of the people and the history. if you have trouble focusing, this is not a show for you.if you got past these three major criticisms without second guessing yourself, and you like fantasy, there is no reason that you shouldn't like this show. everything from the story, to music, to set pieces, to wardrobe, to acting and beyond, is top notch. it may take a few episodes to be fully immersed, but once your into the show its hard to get out! 10 out of 10."
2012-05-03,link1907-360-813540,WOW!! Amazing show!,10,"this is by far the best tv show i've watch. haven't read the book but heard enough about them to know that the show is well written and stay true to the original writing. what is amazing in this show is that it has plot twist, lots of different story and there is no real good and evil. everyone is looking for his own personal goal and that is what make this story amazing. it's not a fight between good and evil. and even better, every single character can die even the main character. like eddard stark who died at the end. you feel the fear of the character and are really worried about what happen to them. it's realistic as the good guy will not always win and live happy.the show is amazing the cast is amazing, i find nothing wrong about the show. everything is perfect and it will probably be the only 10/10 i will give ever for a show or a movie. it's a must watch!!!"

2019-04-26,tharris190,"Awe, I wanted to like this; many good ideas executed poorly",8,"there are a lot of problems with this show, the strange pacing or lack thereof (i'm calling you out screenwriters!), the frequent overacting of everyone outside of the main cast, the stunted plot,lines, unintentionally silly expositional dialogue and overt use of sexuality which sometimes dehumanizes the characters.i also have personal qualms with the sadistic and nihilistic tone, random acts of unnecessarily graphic/gratuitous sexual violence, and the plodding storylines.i do not think this is a good show. it's entertaining at times, with themes and ideas that are interesting, but without being especially engaging. perhaps that is due to its constant stream of dialogue and reliance upon aggressively dark, cruel and violent imagery to punctuate this otherwise dull and melancholic death-march.there are moments that shine for their use of witty humor or occasionally action and set-pieces. episodes directed by neil marshall particularly stand out. some of the dialogue in other episodes could have been written by children; ...heavily caffeinated, severely disturbed children.i feel that somewhere beneath the ham-fisted dialogue and unresolved aggression, there's probably a very interesting and fun story that's worth watching or reading, but somebody needs to do a second pass on this series and kinda just smooth it out a little bit, maybe cut some of the scenes down so it flows better from plotline to plotline, character to character. as it is, this series kinda sucks."
2019-04-29,kristalw1212,Heartracing,10,"this was an epic on the edge of your seat episode. i would have given it a 10/10 but some of the scenes were too poorly lit and hard to see. i have read a few complaints about how the night king died in what some describe as anticlimactic, or that the last 9 years have lead up to a disappointing conclusion with the night king, but this is game of thrones not the walking dead. the main story is not about the white walkers but ultimately who wins the iron throne."
2016-09-21,johnnyhstevens,Good but the books were (once again) better,3,"this show is good. excellent actually. but the simple fact of the matter is: the books were better. i know, to a lot of people that seems unfair but i think its impossible watching this show without comparing it to its book counterpart. everything seems dumbed down. the characters are simplified. for example tyrion, played by the excellent peter dinklage( who despite the criticism i'm giving the character pulls him off marvelously, especially the trial scene in season 4) is dumbed down from a guy who does have a good moral compass but still kills people without any remorse, to a one dimensional hero. the story is dumbed down. whereas in the books every action has a heavy consequence, in the show, there either is no conspiracy or varys and littlefinger kill someone randomly because the character that killed them in the books(and who has a motivation there) has been cut. but the performances are excellent, for the most part, even though they sometimes misrepresent their original characters (i.e jaime, tyrion and euron). kudos goes to the child actors who all do a great job despite having no previous experience. the execution of the heavier scenes are great, like the battle of the bastards, even though they don't make any sense. and it does feel like the books, and represents the books mostly well. my favorite aspect of the show is that we see all the great places from the books come to life, it's biggest flaw is the characterization of jaime in the later seasons. overall good..... but the books were better"

during season 6, it started to feel like different kind of show, but i still liked it, great visuals, nice storytelling, amazing acting.
if i were to recommend it to somebody, i would say, it's amazing 1,6 sesons, 7 feels kinda off, but the ending is horrible, just to make prepere them for the worst.
overall it's not lost time, cause we still received amazing battles, great characters, and beautiful world. just ending isn't good, cause creators wanted to rush it.
it's not even hbo fault, they wanted 10 seasons at least. they even managed to convince creators to make 8 seasons instead of 7. if it weren't for hbo we would have much more plot holes and stupid solucions.
8/10 is my final score, could've been 10, but this last season really broke (heh) the show."

why did so many prophecies get airtime to be squashed in 6 episodes? why bring back jon, just to have him kill dany and go back to the place where he was murdered? did the writers forget he was the king in the north? why has sansa become so powerhungry? why can she declare the north independent? why is bran the king of the six kingdoms? what did the nk want with him? why have arya evolve from a tomboy to a stonecold badass, just to have her sail off to nowhere. so many questions. and so unsatisfying to have it end here.
d&d have honestly just butchered so many great characters just so they can move on to their next project. i am not even looking forward to reading the next books(if they ever get released) since i feel so conflicted about my favorite characters.
season 1,6 were brilliant.
season 7 was just a filler for the r+l=j

2020-04-22,nealsharmon,No desire to view the world this way,10,"only watched two episodes with vidangel (because everyone in my company said i needed to at least watch two episodes) and don't intend to ever watch again. i don't want to view any world in this way, much less relate it to our own. while the cinematography and story telling breaks new ground for a tv series, i don't see how this sort of depraved view of humanity helps our society in any way. while it may reflect some of the most base, political culture of our world, why celebrate it? i prefer consuming media with purpose rather than just engaging entertainment and brilliant writing. it is a modern phenomenon that so many billions of minutes of humankind have been invested into this show. i have chosen not to add any more to that tally."
2011-05-24,simon-james,Better than the book,7,"george r. r. martin books are a well written but often tedious read. he has created a rich lore world that feels like a medieval europe but with a hint of fantasy with a large cast of characters. and this is often the problem to many characters with to many parts to play. but the hbo adaptation filters out a lot of the tedium and condenses it into a very gripping show. it almost feels like the sopranos set in middlearth.the only problem that i can see with the show is the knowledge of what i know is coming from the books. and i know who dies and what happens and i think the non,book reading fans of the show will be very unhappy with some of the major characters just being killed off on almost a whim by martin's trying to shock style of writing. and come the second season they will feel that there aren't really any likable characters to care about any more. so we may see lower viewing figures when popular characters are killed off.and will hbo really carry out the show to the end is another big problem. we are four books into the adventure with the fifth coming this summer and no resolve on any of the plot points, martin is making this a 7 book epic, so will hbo run this for 7 season? that is why i give it a 8 because of what the future could bring for the shows production. but so far a very enjoyable show."
2018-12-29,danilo-css,Perfect,1,"it's simply a must watch if you like tv series. excellent story, acting, characters that make it really addictive. one of the best i've ever seen."
2019-05-21,stephensonthomas,Still the best series ever despite season 8,10,even though season 8 was very disappointing it's still without doubt a 10/10 and deserves to go down as the best tv series of all time.
2019-05-20,parthmodi-41795,Could have been better.,1,"inspite of investing a fortune in the show, they could not adapt all the characters of the book. last both the seasons felt extremely rushed. trash show compared to books.
but from show point it disappointed since s4."
2019-05-20,hamadarin,"Early seasons are good , the rest not so much",9,the early seasons are good as there is character development and the audience gets to know them better but then comes season 6 and so on it all goes downhill from there so in conclusion don't waste your time on this garbage show because the finale is a disaster and you will regret watching it trust me.
2020-11-03,rclakers,Seasons 1-4 are AMAZING. Seasons 5 & 6 are still great! Season 7 shows a decine! Season 8 was pure garbage.,1,"my advice for anyone watching game of thrones for the first time. watch the first 6 seasons. brilliant characters, dark & gritty plot with twists, great dialogue, great settings, great soundtracks. it's a truly one of a kind unique show. after watching the first 6 seasons, season 7 is optional. it's not bad but not great either. it has its' special moments too though. but when it comes to season 8, forget it. you're better off imaging your own final season in your head because it'll be better than what this show prduced. logic doesn't exist anymore this season. characters are dumbed down and have lost their depth. it's very rushed and short. it's a disgrace of a season to a show this great. once again, you can come up with a better ending to game of thrones in 10 seconds than what season 8 really is. it's skippable. i'll give it a 10/10 because those first 6 seasons were memorable and are some of the greatest telvision i've ever witnessed."
2021-03-07,busterandgossip,I still feel bitter about this...,10,"i rated this 10/10 before seeing the last season...i have wasted so much of my life watching this, its like a bitter divorce... it was ruined in the end..."
2019-05-24,mr_ele,A magnificent TV series... with an extremely disappointing ending,8,"got ran for 8 seasons .got became a global phenomenon.got had amazing story arcs, visuals, music directing and writing.but once the show surpassed the masterfully written books by george rr martin, struggled badly.got became a joke of what it once was. especially in the last two seasons.got was amazing, but the moment season 7 came along, that feeling that you always had while watching this series was not the anymore.if you don't want to be disappointed then watch the first six seasons.
that show was top ten, ever. even though season 5 and 6 were not on par with the formers they still had their moments.got joins dexter, lost, and battlestar gallactica as great shows that ended poorly by their standards.a shame, it could have gone the other way and joined breaking bad and the wire.it is not even that it was a controversial ending, it was simply rushed, which makes everything worse.got had a bad ending.this is a 9/10 mainly because of the behemoth that it was during it's prime.the latter seasons were so rushed, none of it make sense.i'm truly sad.thinking of what it could have been, all the blame goes to d&d who decided to end the show prematurely.
hbo offered 10 seasons but they chose 8 seasons making the last two, shorter.watch in it's entirety only if you want to feel disappointed.
stop at season 6 and let your mind do the work."
2019-05-25,kopitexenon,Epic first 5 seasons. Absolutely horrible last 3 seasons. Read the books for a better experience.,1,"seasons 1 to 5: outstanding. the best series that can ever grace this mundane world.but seasons 6, 7 and especially season 8 completely destroy the character development, world building, attention to intricate detail, epic dialogue and sheer quality that the first 5 seasons bestowed upon us.what could have been the best series ever is now just a really good series with a horrible ending.. and that's the saddest and most heartbroken i've ever been about any series or movie in my life."
2019-05-20,josh-18562,The best ever (S1-7),10,"ah game of thrones, just an absolute masterpiece from start to nearly finish. this show was just head and shoulders above anything else in film or tv in my opinion for years, and i highly recommend it for everyone. i've watched it too many times to count and it will always hold a special place in my heart even though season 8 was ultimately very disappointing. if you somehow haven't seen it yet, just watch until season 7 and come up with your own ending because it'll be better than what d&d have given you. x"
2019-05-25,jard-81779,An all time great,9,"it's sad that got couldn't cement its place as the greatest show of all time. had the last two seasons been as good as the previous ones, got would have been the undisputed greatest show in history in my own opinion.the quality of both the production and the plot was unmatched in television and i will never forget how powerful this show once was. it is truly a piece of art. the actors did a tremendous job and while some of them might have been unknown before the show, they made sure their names would not be forgotten. what is dead may never die. for the team that worked to make the show visually stunning, a big thank you. and at last, i would like to thank the writers for creating this, but curse them for also ruining it at the very end. the fact that they had to rush the ending to move on, and tackle new projects is very disappointing. they should have given their role to another team of writers if they wanted to move on, and let them do the fans, but most importantly the show, justice.nevertheless, this will remain a show that redefined what could be done on television, that set a standard for future adaptations and that brought life to the fantasy genre on television. new upcoming shows like the lord of the rings on amazon prime, the witcher on netflix and of course the prequels of this very show on hbo are something i look forward to. and for this, i am infinitely thankful that got was made. the first 4 seasons or even first 6 seasons are the best stretch of television history in my eyes. and for those who haven't seen the show : i implore you to watch it, even if the end is not up to par. because i can assure you, there are some things that you will never forget while watching this."
2018-08-10,jocelyngomezc,Best TV show ever.,10,"i've seen a lot of tv shows in my life but nothing like got. i've cried, laughed, screamed, and fallen in love with the characters. the places they are in are extraordinary and the dragons look so real, the fights and deaths looks so real, and i love the girl power in it too! it has everything. i absolutley love it. i was on game of thrones live concert this year and it made me fall in love with the show even more. it's just perfectly made."
2020-12-26,abdotarek-82016,Perfect Show,10,"a masterpiece .. for me it is the greatest show i've ever seen in my entire life, it's an excellent work from all sides : writing, directing , casting , acting performance , visual effects , sound editing , sound tracking and costumes designing .. briefly it's perfect."
2019-05-20,sebastianpatrikios,"Amazing, but sad!!",10,"this show is amazing, the first 6 seasons is exceptional and without any mistakes!! it is the best show ever to air on tv ,i gave it 8/10 because season 7 and 8 lack the very foundation that game of thrones was build on."
2021-08-06,f3no,Worth watching despite the ending stigma.,5,"after watching it 4 times, i could easily say it's my favorite series, despite the fact i lose very fast interest in series. if i had to describe the world of game of thrones in one word, that word would be cruel."
2016-11-30,jhayesmockery,The Little Guy is Great,7,"the little guy makes the show. the dude is an absolute savage and he deserves his own spin off. remember i wrote this when my little homie gets his own spin off titled ""when the little guy becomes the big guy"" seriously, i really enjoy his character and not only is he one heck of a drinker but he really knows how to get the job done. his brother who would be arrested if this took place in the united states would be arrested because he was sleeping with his sister is pretty chill too. hes a good person, he just made some mistakes along the way. i mean lets be real in the first 2,3 seasons his sister was pretty hot. before she shaved her hair, but even with the buzz cut shes still a solid 7 like this review! now the sister she doesn't have great luck with kids, her oldest - my god. and the youngest, he took a dive from the top of the tower. great scene and was a very exciting moment for the show. great job from the producers.lets hop over to the main star here, jon snow. what a legend he was. i say was, because he died! he died, come on we all saw it. he laid there for like a full year until the new season came on. you don't just get to be dead for a full year and then come back and live your life. i truly feel this show paints the wrong picture to viewers. viewers need to know, you don't get to get stabbed multiple times, play dead for a year and then just randomly wake up. wake up people, its not real! so many people in this show and hard to keep track of. if i can make one suggestion to the director it would be to rename the characters. just start from scratch, get rid of their crazy names and just use names like jeff, tom, linda, mary. i think we can all agree on that? lastly i will leave off with kalisi or however you spell it. shes great, truly an angel. if i have to make a prediction about this show is that kalisi is the last one standing and she becomes an angel and floats in to the heavens above and sits next to the lord and savior. one more prediction - the older stark daughter kills jon. later bro!oooohhhh and lastly - hodo was a waste of space. the guy couldn't even talk! hes a monster and he just takes up space. good riddance!good show, i recommend it. plan to binge watch."
2019-05-20,guldbrand-73462,Almost.,10,by far the best show ever aired. what a shame it went out with a fizzle

2019-05-20,ormgutt,Game of Thrones: The best and the worst TV has to offer.,10,"*just giving it a 1/10 to lower the imdb score. there's no way for me to properly score this show after all these years*this is a very short review. game of thrones will go down in history as one of the best tv,series ever created, period. if they would have made the second half of game of thrones equally good as the first half, then it would objectively be the best tv-show ever made. unfortunately, that's not how it turned out. it's difficult to compare game of thrones to any other show, so much so i think it shouldn't be. got had it's own thing going.ranking all of the seasons: season 1: 10/10 perfect.
season 2: 10/10 perfect.
season 3: 10/10 perfect.
season 4: 10/10 perfect.
season 5: 7/10 good.
season 6: 8/10 great.
season 7: 4/10 bad.

2019-05-20,shashankmistry-21672,Why HBO?,1,"they ruined it in last season. like they forgot how to write game of thrones.
every body wants remake of season 8 but i don't think its possible.
evem they should tell us more about nightking,but no they ended him like some kind of joke.
they build the whole story from beginning that winter is coming and when winter arrives ,they ended it in 1hr 22 mins, this is not fair.
i rate every season 10/10
and 8th season 3/10"
2017-10-08,teacherlady-66593,Best on TV,10,"i joined the game of thornes late, but so glad i did. this is one of the best series of tv. the plot is intriguing, the animation, sound effect, special effects, etc are stellar. the characters are very likable (some love to hate) and the acting is amazing. i was disappointed that season 7 was only eight episodes long. i am sure it is very expensive to produce, so i will wait patiently for season 8."

2017-08-22,trashmail-72817,The best TV-show out there!,8,"this tv show is perfect! there are literally no con's i can think of. with this tv show you never know who's gonna survive and who's gonna die, who's gonna turn bad and who's gonna turn out to be the good guy. there is a perfect balance of good guys and villains. there are none. there are errors on all sides of the participating families in this story, which gives this tv show a very (humanly) realistic vibe. its an epic tale everyone should see! in my opinion (and i like to believe that i know my stuff) this is the best tv,show ever made."

2018-01-09,saifeddinemejri,THE BEST,10,this tv show is probably the best in his category but the main problem is that the season 8 starts after a year from the season 7 ended and that's really sad for the fans
2019-05-20,ianwright-53602,"Season 8 , great start, except for the last 2 episodes",10,"the ending should be in minus figures. although the long night and the build up promised so much. 8 years of my life watching what should have been a classic in the making. now all everyone can talk about is what we're they thinking in the last 2 episodes! shame on you, lazy rushed amateur ending, made no sense. hope disney sees sense and let's you nowhere near star wars now!"

2019-05-10,jacobnoble-02524,Game of Thrones,10,"i would give this an easy 10/10.. if season 8 didn't exist. but it does, unfortunately.season 1,6 10/10 amazing, complex dialogue and intriguing logical story lines with strong character developments and shocking emotional moments. on top of the insane action scenes. a few minor flaws in s5/6season 7- 7/10 - still good but seemed rushed and had some illogical moments that made no sense.season 8- 3/10 i actually don't know where or start. season 8 is a joke. terrible writing. nothing makes sense. the writers have butchered many character's developments and given hardly any satisfying conclusions to their story arcs. brans story had no pay off at all and his whole role as the 3 eyed raven proved pointless against the night king. jaime's redemption arc was cut off instantly with real no reason. the night kings death was underwhelming. infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. no sansa and cersei interaction of any sort which i would have liked to have seen. unbelievable unrealistic plot armour. the plot armour ruined the battle of winterfell. 'all' the dothraki wiped out in seconds yet samwell tarly can fend them off. many more characters needed to die that episode. rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet drogon dodges an iron fleets worth of scorpions at kings landing, which weren't even shooting, just to serve the plot. i guess euron forgot about dany's dragon and her forces. jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected? ). speaking of jon, what was the point of his lineage? it didn't change anything. i kind of like danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - it went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocents. it was actually laughable. needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. after dany's death it just skipped to tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over it. anything that required any thought from the writers was done off screen, like arya and sansa finding out about jon's lineage. major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. there are some good moments but very few and far between. have to appreciate effort by cast, directing and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole. also, cersei, who i personally think is the most interesting character gets 20 minutes screen time all season and does nothing except look out of a window.overall- 8/10 purely on s1-7"
2020-04-17,jensburnham,The best TV show ever!,10,"i was prejudice towards watching got because i never liked fantasy but i was hooked immediately. i never enjoyed any show as much as got. it is set in a fantasy world but it shows brutality, intrigue, family love and hate and all aspects of life in positive and negative effects. never have i seen such a character building and twists in plots. important characters suddenly die and you never predict what will happen. the dialogs are some of the the best ever written. i love this epic show. the problem is that no show can match it which makes future tv shows not as good as could be."
2017-12-23,aresaionheroes,Master piece,10,i can easily say this will always remain the best tv show ever ever made.
2019-05-16,boy_qatar,Impossible,2,good nice my favorite episode good good very great episode
2020-05-04,mtmarimele,Still a big part of TV culture after all,5,"no spoilers this show is amazing. i have watched it just now in under 20 days and it was a spectacular journey. music is great, character development is great, acting is superb and the visuals are stunning (as they should be if you are spending milions). the story is perfect up until season 8(season 7 is my favorite, specially the end).
season 8 gives you some stuff that is questionable but its still a decent ending, i did expect more but you can't have everying that you want. if you havent watched it you should because it is common knowledge to know some of the stuff in there and it has a power to take you outside of your world and still teach you some valuable lessons."
2019-05-20,falakkas,The best show ever,7,"what can i say it's the best the writing the characters is all the best
the development of the characters like john or arya or sansa the wall between the lanster and stark is epic"

2019-07-11,thiseasmenexes,The best series of all!!!,9,"as fan of game of thrones, i wanted an end which no one waiting for it, as in the previous seasons . this episode was exactly what i wanted. i mean, dany wasn't the best choice for the throne because of her madness, which we watch it since the 6th episode of season 1 till the last episode. jon doesn't want to be the king. tyrion is the best person to be the hand of the king, not the king. sansa is a good queen but she wanted the north to be an independent kingdom with her in the throne. i think the change of the government system was the best end that could have such a series, as game of thrones, that is full of moral lessons. and finally, something for everyone who say that jon snow go to the wall without reason, in the final episode tyrion said that there is always a place for bastards and criminals. if that did not convince you, think about the game of thrones being played in a fantasy world that could be at risk at any time. i really want more series like game of thrones!!!"
2018-09-15,danieltpost,"Spectacular? Absolutely. Best of the Genre, Top 20 All Time",8,"wow...i cant believe it's been so long since season 1 aired. i'll never forget randomly stumbling onto the series with no previous knowledge of its existence, just after the season 1 finale aired. i didn't have much binge watching experience under my belt at that point, but got definitley played a huge part in changing the way i watched most tv series the future had in store for me. i watched all of season 1 in no more than two days. one of very few shows i can vividly remember where i was, what i was doing, and how i was feeling when the credits rolled. boy, what a treat that first season was! i knew then, without ever having to see any further episodes, that got was a show i would no doubtedly stick with from beginning to end, no matter what. that first season definitely set the tone for the rest of the series, in every aspect, and you can expect to have many of the same emotions, good and bad (there will be plenty of both), throughout the rest of the series. if you're looking for a show that will never leave you wanting to scratch your eyes out, got isn't for you. it's a certified roller coaster of emotions. if you're a fan of sci,fi or fantasy, got is absolutely mandatory. however, the show has so much to offer that it's mandatory for a lot more than sci-fi and fantasy fans. you'd be easier making of a list of the people who wouldn't thoroughly enjoy got. it would definitley be significantly shorter. my only two gripes with the show (hence 8 stars instead of 10) is what i see as a few failures in the story's development pace and scope. this occurred mostly in season 2. i won't give anything away, but certain storylines from season 2 dragged so god-awfully slow for me. i feel like it reached out of its own season 2 realm and affected certain (but small) parts of the seasons that followed. i've zeroed in on what i think went wrong, and after a flawless and extremely well-received season one, the writers got a little too big headed and swung way too hard for the fences in season 2 and ultimately bit off more than they could chew. what i mean by that is the time constraints involved with any television production mixed poorly with how exhaustively detailed the books are and the writers thought they could get way more accomplished than what tv time allowed for. there were way too many insignificant characters introduced and their story lines ended up being dead ends in the long run, consequently leaving a few openings in the plot that should've been closed or should've never even existed in the first place in the later seasons. to sum up, i would say got is as close as it gets to flawless without being so, and season 2 is what prevented that acheievement. nevertheless, don't let it stop you from experiencing one of the greatest shows you'll ever watch on television. i cannot wait for the final season!"
2021-01-31,sai-57293,"The best, until they ruined it.",7,"there isn't any valid reason for the series to be rushed to it's completion. i completely agree with the ending but , enough screen time for our beloved characters would've made the ending more justified and that much more appealing. just because the directors wanted to move on to the other projects they killed their own project. still one of the best series i've watched till date."

2019-05-20,anandpittan,Not to the top but very close to the top show ever.,9,"don't discourage yourself about this show by some negative critics . wait till last episode ,u will definitely rispect it. 5 first seasons were extra ordinary, top class , master piece. after that show goes slightly down but still pretty much fasinating . in overall 7 seasons took this show to top. 8th season bends this show down but ... last episode was more than what u expected. no one can imagine ending of this show . last episode brings back the class of this show. worth watching."
2020-05-09,azhemal,Best tv series I have seen in my lyf,6,"this is damn series <3 just amazing...in this series there is thriller, politics, actions,horror, emotions , sci,fi,drama and nudes ^_^ !! this series have everything..but last season was disappointed me a little bit..but that's good..still i love game of thrones <3and i will love it.i saw this series for 1 time.. next time i wanna see this series with my wife it's my dream <3"
2019-05-20,dr_deadbeat,Summing it up....,10,"the finale is not what many expected but when you review the characters story arcs and history throughout the entire saga i don't think there were many surprises, except for who eventually got to rule the 6 kingdoms which was a good twist. i for one did not expect.arya: has been a lone wolf throughout and left to follow her own path.sansa: always wanted to be queen and never wanted to answer a higher authority. she achieved this by becoming the queen of the north and making sure it was independent.jon: his entire journey has been a case of making the right decisions for the right reasons but led to to terrible outcomes usually for himself. the final series summed this up, from the moment he was told he was the true heir he had the opportunity to usurp daenerys and claim the throne which ultimately would have meant the mass slaughter of an entire city of mostly innocent people would not have happened, but he chose to stick to his word and answer to daenerys as queen. this then led to him being imprisoned and then banished because he had no choice but to kill her, all of which could have been different if he just took the throne. there are other examples of this if you watch the entire saga through again.daenerys: became the type of ruler she was trying so hard not to be. her descent in to madness slowly became apparent as she lost her closest allies/friends as they are either killed or betray her throughout series 8. the moment jon rejects her prior to the masacre is clearly when she snaps. you can then see the moment in her expression when the bells ring and she succumbs to the reality that she has become the type of queen that she never wanted to be, one that has to rule by fear, her demise at the hands of jon was then inevitable.the one gripe i would have is, once the unsullied had left westeros, why didn't jon snow just go wherever he wanted. the only reason he was banished was to appease grey worm, if he is no longer around how was he to know where jon was.i'm not the biggest fan of got but have watched all the episodes as it was a good series and different from any other tv series that have been on lately. all in all over the 8 series it has been a good watch with very few negatives."
2019-05-13,ornamentariumbgd,Season 8 disaster,10,"for me, season 8 ruined it all... like they didn't know what to do with characters, they picked them off one by one in stupid plots.shame."
2018-09-09,abirmondal0001,Truly masterpiece,9,"there is no word to describe this show. it has mystery, drama, adventure, action, fantasy, politics etc.. all in one entertainment."
2019-05-14,doramason,Decline of a Masterpiece,8,"this show started in an epic way and changed how fantasy shows are seen by the public. it eventually become the biggest tv show in history while its production quality and budget went up like a rocket.however after the writers of this show started to diverge from the source material and then when no source material left to follow, show started to take a nose dive. the last two seasons of this show and especially its ending is the biggest disappointment in tv history.i used to recommend this show to anyone but now i don't wanna mention it in conversations, as if it never existed.if you haven't watched it yet, spare yourself the time and watch a show that has a proper bittersweet ending like breaking bad."
2019-12-11,saileshdahal,Totally disappointed on season 8,10,"season 1 to 6 totally outstanding season 7 not outstanding but good
season 8 is totally nonsense"
2019-05-24,danutzzz_eu,When will begin S09 ?!,10,i hope that s08 was a parody and the real one will begin soon.
2021-02-24,adityagnihotri,greatest show of all time,10,even though the last season wasn't up to the mark but still show is and definitely will be the best show of all time.everyone must watch it
2019-07-12,nathos-52282,Ending not as bad as they saying,10,"so the final few series has gotten some flak. but the only real problem was the pace. they really should of expanded on daenerys paranoia more. ed sheeran in it was dumb and takes you out of the narrative, even if handled ok for that brief scene. thing that bugged me the most was zombie mountain, all that trouble an he only kills 2 people, an one of them by pushing an old guy down some stairs."
2019-01-09,nash-12873,No nooooo,10,im so sick of hey game of t is so awesome hhhhaaaa uuuhhh... no its a sick perverted showing uneseserly nudity perverzion violenc sodomy etc . what in a gods name u people find good in this show its totally disgusting
2018-10-31,anusha-17932,Best show ever made in TV history,10,awaiting for the final season.the best show ever. you surely can connect all the dots of these characters and storyline from season 1. the plots are so much connected. very rare to find such minute details where it still connect to season 1. kudos to the entire team and thanks for making this blockbuster. waiting for new projects from this producer duos. 😊👍
2019-08-10,shielamaetapao,Hope that Season 8 did not come out...,8,"i started to watch got just this year 2019 and it's like movie marathon for me because i did not wait for too long unlike the others. i would have rate this 10/10 if season 8 did not come out.what does season 8 do?? making dany evil without any explainable reason!! i love her character and you did not justify her for being a ""mad queen"" like what was that?? and also, jon snow did not do anything in season 8. why did he come to life again? c'mon! if you agree then we are at the same situation.i hate the ending for ruining the entire story of got. the season 8 has so many plot holes and made the audiences in complete shock! cersei deserves to die in pain but nah, she died easily.i rate 9/10 just for season 1,7. season 8 - 2/10"
2019-05-28,farisjamalalkeshi,a Masterpiece in Television,10,"game of thrones surpassed everyone's expectations in 2011, and continued to do so for 7 years. there are very few flaws within the show, and i would say this is the closest thing i've seen to perfect entertainment. every scene is mighty beautiful, with towering sets that capture your senses. the acting is always perfect, since the quality of actors they hired is superb. most of the audience seems to be let down by the ending, but i found that it perfectly fitted into the world of westeros, and left us hanging for more. the only thing i have to say to the beginners of the franchise is let go of all expectations. they're useless anyway. if anything deserves a 10/10, it's the behemoth phenomenon that is game of thrones."
2019-11-01,almakrisch,Great but bad.,9,i gave got a 10/10 just because the first 6 six seasons were a masterpiece. the two last seasons? well...
2019-05-22,nikitadarforth,Awesome,9,"i looove it! also the last season was good but it was too rushed, no building up the tention, it was just bang boom and then gone! though i love the series overall, the best ever. im sure they worked soo hard to make it awesome and they did their best, im happy. great work"
2019-11-02,kunkell,Imagine an Ice Cream Shop,1,"so imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. they've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? a brownie? some delicious house made whipped cream... man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. wow what more could you ask for? cherry on top? bring it on!!and then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some dijon mustard on for good measure.you don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.that's essentially game of thrones. i tried to rewatch it, but as i got through the first season i began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. there are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time i come back here i drop it one more star it seems like. game of thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae."
2019-02-20,dominicajarvis,Can't remember anything that happened,9,"i've watched all the seasons, and i remember enjoying them. but don't ask me to remember what the hell has happened before the next season hits!very little happens for so much of seven seasons. incredible. it's basically a soap with dragons. don't get me wrong, that's great, but how did it last this many years?will be happy when it's done and i'll know if it was worth it."
2019-03-03,rohitkrrht,The show that destroyed my interest in TV series!,10,"got raised the standards of television series in such a way, be it in terms of any any aspect, the plot, vfx, fantasy, action.etc. that any show that i watch or at least try to, hardly live up to my expectations. this is i would say, the best series i ever saw or the best show made till date. each and every character has been worked upon beautifully, certain characters whom you might hate initially, end up being one of your favourite characters. with the 8th season on the way, i would recommend now is the ideal time to binge this. just give it a go..."
2019-06-15,heartofalion-48979,All time greatest show,10,"okay where do i begin. fire breathing dragons, lust, treason, betrayal, loyalty, the king of the north, you know nothing jon snow.. i mean c'mon! this is an epic show that has everything and anything you can think of in a time period filled with fantasy galore. i love it love love it! please if you have not seen this show yet and if spoilers have ruined it for you from watching. i beg you it is still worth the watch. 😁"

2019-05-20,narutouzumake-38165,Why I rated this show 10/10?,10,game of thrones series has 8 seasons and its all was perfect except the last one and its include only 6 episodes so why should i rate this masterpiece lower then 10/10? game of thrones is the best tv show i've ever seen
2019-05-15,ahmed-76264,The long night,8,this is the good episod because i love what is the doing in the walking and episodes
2019-04-25,bondsophia,Game of Thrones !! Legendary episode,9,"legendary episode is what comes to my mind after watching the episode.oh my god.. !!!! this is the real game of thrones. bestest, greatest television episode of all time. kit (jon snow) was awesome & magnificent. he was at the highest point of level of his skills & acting. everything is so much perfect. i could watch it 100 times. it's masterpiece guys. just go and watch!!!!the only thing i found even marginally disappointing about this episode was the character deaths; i wish there were more of them! but that's probably just me being masochistic.what an absolutely fantastic ride of an episode, i hope the finale delivers."
2019-05-20,nehalgoenka,Once in a Century,3,"a series like this is hard to imagine and i am lucky to watch this outstanding series. apart from the end season, there cannot be any negatives pointed against got in an overall view. however, the end is quite disappointing. seems that the story took some turn and it was as if the directors were trying to end the series in any manner. the cinematography of the whole series specially the battle seens are beyond the praise. a must watch series."

2019-04-29,alibgh,Phenomenal,10,"it was awesooome! each second was fantastic
i've never thought of that ending..
after the last scene i was shocked and just standing for some minutes..
thanks everyone for making this gorgoeus extraordinary breathtaking battle scene!"
2019-05-20,ahmad_alfarsy,season 8 ruined everything,9,well i would've give this 10/10 but season 8 ruined the entire series it killed the series
2019-05-16,benameurdjawed,Best tv show ever,7,the showrunner made us live the conquests the betrayals and the fall of monarchs in these 8 seasons
2019-12-22,haroonsyed-72882,8/10,1,one of the greatest series with worst ending possible.
2019-05-12,carlgengenwin,What a waste.,10,"up until season 4, i was convinced nothing could or even would ever compare to game of thrones.after season 5, i thought ""ok, this one was a bit weaker, but they'll do better on the next one"".season 6 came around and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't that good either. great cinematography, sure, but that's because of the huge budget. the writing, on the other hand...anyways, i was convinced that the writers would learn from their mistakes and give us a flawless season 7, on account of there being less episodes. i was wrong again. the writing was... catastrophic. yet i still found myself enjoying the action scenes, once my brain was turned off.i told myself ""you know what, it can't possibly get any worse... right ?""well... i was wrong. not only is the last season almost ingeniously bad, it also destroyed all the build up from the first seasons.at least now i know it won't get worse than that. you know, because it's ended."
2019-05-20,salrehaily,Got,7,it amazing show and epic i love these and i hope it never ended

2020-05-21,dominiquegremmen,Honest review,5,"season 1: it's pretty slow and boring, feels more like a sex series then anything els season 2,5: this is where the series definitly took off, and it became one of the greatest series from the past 10 years.
season 6-7-8: started to go downhill super fast, and the ending is pretty much a disaster which makes the rewatchabilitty on this show non existent for me, especially when you get to season 8, it's just better to play with your own snot."
2019-05-21,baodinh-08385,You should have read the books.,9,"watch the first 4 seasons, they are masterpiece, then read the book. you can watch season 5 and 6 if you want, they have their problems but they are good too and don't even touch season 7 and 8 if you don't want the show ruin for you."
2019-05-21,julienser,WORST ending ever !,5,the best show in the world ruined by the last season and the last épisode...
2020-04-12,ahmedmustafa-08528,"Spectaculer, Surprising, Powerful...!",5,"nobody recommend me to watch it before, and i wondered if it is as they say...well i watched the serie, and i loved it, great events, scenes, acting, story, and shocked all the time!!first season was so good to a beginner, second season two much better, season 3 4 5 6 7 are great, and the only reason that i don't give got 10 out of 10 is season 8i am not saying that it was bad but it wasn't good as last seasons, maybe that is the way that should put an end to the great got, so it doesn't need to everone to complain about the final season, i say there was no other way and you are mistaken by giving it below the 6 at least!!!!i gave the last season 8 because i gave that seasons before 10 out of 10"

2019-08-14,julifischerx,GoT is destroyed,1,"i don't know what to say, season 1,4 are just perfect 11/10, 5 and 6 are like a 9,5/10 and season 7 is a 7,5/10. season 4 is maybe the best tv show season ever. but then in april 2019 season 8 was released and it was terrible. bad writing, crazy development of the personalities of a few characters, way too short and a disgrace for every fan of game of thrones. season 8 is a 2/10 for me, it would be a 0/10 but the first episode is ok. because of the unbelievable bad ending got is destroyed forever."
2019-06-09,samxdxsmith,One of the greatest TV series in history with the worst payoff,10,"i have watched every episode multiple time.... except the last two episodes. great suspsence, cinematography, music and acting all the way until season 8. which makes the aweful payoff even worse."

2019-09-21,vihashbeezb,Very good start but bad end,8,"this show different type because it have multiple storyline's. 1,6 season have very good and 7 season it also good but not at all before season and season 8 it is have not good ending."
2020-06-23,eman_eraqi,Game of thrones is the best,9,"this series is wonderful in all aspects, such as a story, acting and drama, and for the events of the strong series, directing and the music, with the knowledge that the series is excerpted from the george r. martin story. and the eighth season is not bad, but the reason for its failure is not the story, but the hasty events and the killing of characters in an irrational way.
and in the got is the best"
2019-10-01,alexysposta,Brilliant minus the ending,6,"amazing from start to...i want to say end, unfortunately i can't...the ending was a total dissappointment. killing the character you built your whole story around, the character you always pulled out as a winner, as the one who will sit on the infamous iron throne..and killed nonetheless by the one who loves her and is loved by her.
and jamie and cersei's deaths... really??
the last episode was like the writer was in a hurry to just get it over with.
the last episode earned the whole series seven stars and not ten from my side."
2020-01-06,jayaswalronish,Super boring,10,the only major problem with this show is that they have too many overdramatic scenes before any major event that makes this boring
2019-10-04,sammatthews-04428,Great series,10,the series was incredible each episide was action packed. i love the series and i expected that the finale season would be even better as the whole series was good and it had built suspense for the last season. i must admit the last season was a big let down for me as it was nothing that i expected. but overall game of thrones was amazing i loved it.
2019-10-26,lowcountry_girl,"By defying logic, sensible motivations, years of characterization, and the rules of the world GRRM created, S8 renders GoT ultimately frustrating and unsatisfying viewing.",10,"the competence with which a (previously) well,told story concludes matters greatly. there could be no greater example of that than game of thrones.the numerous failures of season 8 have been expounded on in many other reviews and why got's final season renders all of game of thrones unwatchable has also been well explained.i will only add that to anyone considering giving the series a go despite the criticism, do yourself a favor by stopping watching after episode 6x10, entitled the winds of winter.then make up your own endings for the characters you love; trust me, whatever you come up with will be more sensible and satisfying than the illogical, amateurish dreck long-term viewers were apparently expected to swallow wholesale."
2019-10-28,erikhauglin,"Great acting and production value, yet lost its quality",10,"some of the greatest acting performances i've ever seen, especially from lena heady. great sets, props and costumes. believable story and human relationships. incredible reality, until season 7 and 8. this is a ten because of all i mentioned above, except the writing and story in the 2 last seasons."
2021-02-01,gloryogg,Perfect example of a TV show done well,10,amazing tv show from start to finish. i loved the characters and how well they played their part. each episode left you wanting more. a lot of people were disappointed with the ending but i personally loved it and would recommend it. a must watch and i will be getting the books too soon. i can't watch any tv show anymore as no other show will ever live up to got.
2019-11-27,gloverzach,"Great show, but insanely rushed ending.",10,"one of the best shows i've ever watched. some of the best battle scenes i've ever seen (battle of the bastards is #1). seasons 1,6 as close to 10/10 as a show can get (other than breaking bad). season 7: 8/10. season 8 i won't even bother to give a rating. season 8 wasn't necessarily bad just unnecessarily rushed. every major plot line and character arc ending is wrapped into 8 episodes, which could've been easily wrapped into at least 2 more seasons. not sure if there was pressure from hbo or somewhere else to wrap everything up so quickly, but i don't think it was ""fair"" to all the fans. overall, a great show just a rushed ending."
2020-01-09,singhayush-20273,"Can be best explained by its ending, an unfinished joke.",10,"the end scene where tyrion goes on to tell his joke for the tenth time without him finishing perfectly wraps up what this show turned out to be , a joke, an unfinished one at that. most important questions and plot iines are left unanswered or just dumped and forgotten after 10 years of build up. first time watchers go ahead with the first four seasons and fall in love with what was one the greatest tv show of all time."
2020-01-03,nickmisencik-37560,STILL my favorite show of all time,7,"i hate that i have to put still my fav show ever. it sucks because people love to hate on anything when most of the haters jump in late which is fine but don't bring the negativity. the creators of this show deserve a lot of credit and have never done what people want or what they predict. season 8 was good, not great. that is all i will say about that.this show is so beautiful. the acting performance with the writing go hand in hand so fluently. there are so many great characters and the deaths on the show are so well done. its hard because you really get attached even if you try not to. i have watched this show 6+ times and love it more each time. seasons 1,6 are literally the best thing ever. 7 is amazing and 8 is good. this show is so special to me and worth a good watch."
2021-03-16,bridgesew,:/,9,"i really loved this show so much, seasons 1,4 were so close to perfect, it was unbelievable. i enjoyed season 5 reasonably but it had brief periods of bad writing. season 6 was had similar issues to season 5, like underwritten characters and occasionally cringe inducing dialogue, however there were almost as many fantastic moments as one or two of the earlier seasons. i don't like to talk about the rest of the show because i believe that season 6 ended on a perfectly satisfying note, even though some plot lines weren't finished. i'm just incredibly disappointed but that doesn't diminish my love for the early seasons because they are genuinely the best seasons of tv i have ever seen."

2020-07-23,jackpul,Magnificent Masterpiece,10,"the series game of thrones is a magnificent piece of art on the screen. characters are written well and performed well too. the story is deep,thought and makes sense in every episode. such unexpected turns in the story make it more addictive. the titles music is good. but i think a bit more screen time should have been given to a few characters like robb stark, talisa stark and catelyn stark. otherwise, it is a well-executed series. worth waiting for each episode and season."
2020-07-19,gokulwartanrm,A fascinating tale,1,so many stories that combines and connects different characters and their lives leading to one big marvelous storyline. so many memorable moments and dialogues are written beautifully.

2021-03-30,marinavail,I'm a loyal fan but...,5,the last season sucked! i absolutely loved everything about the series but the last season felt rushed and did not compare to the very complicated storylines they wrote out over 5 seasons.
2021-04-07,johneorzea,Trash after season 4,10,"first season was great and a solid book adaption. season 2,3 are pretty decent and season 4 is my favorite. season 5 is awful except for possibly episode 8 and it still has faults (i.e shaky cam). seasons 6 and 7 are a bit better than season 5 however, they are weakened by the utter garbage season 8 is. skip this show, my suggestion."
2021-05-11,rusheelputrevu,Masterpiece/ Best show after breaking Bad....,10,"just amazing. character writing is just 🔥🔥. each character is just amazing👍👍👍. without any thought just must watch... reasons for 10 stars:,

2021-06-08,abdulrazik-90617,Die hard fan of GOT,8,this is one of the best series i've never seen in my life. i don't care this series had a poor ending. this is my favorite series from this day until my last day. all hail game of thrones.
2017-07-24,craigearl,"The Estate of Robert E Howard, take note!",7,"got has been consistently good from the start. it is proof positive that heroic fantasy (or sword & sorcery) can be mature entertainment without descending to a xena,like result.midway through the third or fourth episode i suddenly realised that one of the genre's icons, none other than conan of cimmeria, would benefit from the got treatment. conan, woefully misrepresented by a certain mr schwarzenegger, really needs to find a new audience and a regular show might be just the ticket.come on robert e howard's estate - make it happen.anyone else agree?"
2021-07-27,madllen,7/10,9,"i liked the plot, it kept me intrigued most of the time. there are a lot of story lines combined together, and some of them, in my opinion, were more interesting than others. i was interested in the story line of daenerys, sansa and arya: great character development. the ending was kinda dissapointing tho. you can watch the show for the plot, not for the ending."
2020-01-03,raduking,"Sex, dragons and main characters dying...",7,"most overrated shows of all time... if you endure more than 3 seasons then you'll probably watch the rest of them so you don't feel like you have lost all this time.. everything is predictable, except john snow's jesus complex..."
2011-10-11,wireless_emotions,Ideal show vs can-improve-show,10,"the show is good, so much better than many shows on tv, but there's room for improvement.what this show was meant to be, is ,--> 1. a sopranos type drama ---> 2. with many great characters, ---> 3. plenty of amazing twists, evil and tragedy ---> 4. and many lord-of-the-rings-mixed-with-horror type battles.the books set up nice and then deliver. a tv show unfortunately can't deliver all. some things are cut due to budget. some things are added for titillation (although there's plenty of sex in the original story already).so what you get is ---> 1. a sopranos type drama ---> 2. with many good characters (whose introduction can become a drag, because this is not a book)---> 3. plenty of amazing twists (latter half of the series), evil and tragedy---> 4. and boobies---> 5. and some fight scenes and implied battles.still good, stick with it. the story is great and makes up for the lacking lord-of-the-rings type battles.my biggest pet peeve? pacing.the acting is really good (sean bean! the kids! awesome!), but the pacing sometimes feels unbalanced.and i don't mean the snail's pace of the first episodes. that is needed, unfortunately. i mean there's an awkward pacing between the scenes. this series has yet to grow comfortable with itself, find a balance between it's ideal version and the tv/constrained version.i'm rooting for season two anyway."
2021-09-14,mathiasxr,I am not mad. Just dissapointed,10,"game of thrones seasons 1,4 is probably some of, if not the absolute best television i have ever seen. but when only half the show is great i cant give it a 9- or 10/10. season 5 truly is a mediocre season. probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. perhaps a 6,5 in some areas. then we get to season 6. season six is without a doubt the most controversial season of the show overall. in my opinion, 70% of it is meh, 20% trash, and 10% best television ever made. i dont really like season six, but i dont hate it either. there was just some decisions made during production that makes no sense from neither a storytelling or a character perspective.now. the meat and potatoes. season 7 is absolutely horrendous. no, i do not want to listen to people that say that 8 is worse from a writing standpoint. its not. they both suck ass. the only reasons that they say 8 is worse is because 1: its the finale and it sucked. 2: people were getting their hopes up quite a lot for season 8 only to have them shattered in a more obvious way. once you stop to think, season 7 becomes just as bad. people teleporting, characters being reduced to nothing.season 8 is the same as season seven, only its the final season so the argument could easily have been made that its worse, but not in the quality of writing. every character that had not already been thrown out of the window in the spam of season 5-7 gets thrown out the window in season 8. the only character that you could even argue has a good and or satisfying conclusion is theon. and even his death was dumb. the man runs to his death instead of standing his ground and at least trying to defend bran (the absolute disaster of a character) a little longer.if you need actual examples of the terrible nonsense that dumb and dumber calls writing, all you need to do is turn your brain on when watching season 8sorry if i came of as agressive in the end. i just get so sad whenever i think of what the show could have been, had they stuck to the books."
2018-04-22,stageplay,The Best,7,i'll keep this short. game of thrones is the best television series ever made.
2018-07-04,aleminio,Great show but I do not feel satisfied.,10,"they have taken great books and did not fail converting it into an amazing tv show, one of the best ever. the world design is amazing, the atmosphere, the characters, the dialogues, it all looks so good and real.
there's no doubt that they have filmed an awesome show, but still, what makes it so different, what makes it so special that it turned into the hit it is?for me, it's basically the progression of the story. i did not read the books but since the show is based on the books, i can say they have chosen the right books to turn into a show. the story is constantly progressing, you will never feel that an episode has ended but the world has not changed. there's always something happening, everything has a meaning. this is quite rare because books are usually turned into movies. the tv shows are usually quite dull and once they are done with the character and story building, the main plot becomes repetitive and boring, which isn't the case here.
additionally, in got it's not just 1 plot. it's multiple connected events happening in different places in the world. in modern tv shows you usually get to know just one side, usually the ""good side"". in got there's no such thing. you get to know all the sides involved and you never know what's going to happen, who's going to die and who's not.that's how they keep you ""hooked"". there's so much happening, different events in different camps. you will always wonder what's going to happen and how one event in one camp affect all the other things happening around the world.but it all leads me to the main problem that i had with the story.
i finished all 7 seasons, and yes, it was interesting. i was constantly hooked, but i never felt satisfied. it's like i spent 7 season waiting for something, expecting something that has never happened. some main events such as big battles that i wanted to see, never really happened because the heroes died or it will happen only in season 8.
some of the battles that we have seen, did not really meet my expectations.
and all those ""plot twists"" are usually one ally betraying another. it happens so often that i got used to it quickly enough. from there it was hard for me to really call anything a ""plot twist"" when it's expected and already part of the show. the show is basically about sex, death and betrayals.any way, they did something really great here.
i wish we could see more shows like this and stories which are taken from talented book writers, because i can't stand the banal scripts of most tv shows those days."
2012-04-21,avinashbhan,Amazing...........!,10,"i just started watching the series what a week back (4/14/2012) may be, so i got to see he the complete season 1 and i loved it.i like movies/tv series which are multi plotted and if you add the medieval touch that is a classic and that is what game of thrones is.i am not an big fan of tv series but this is one of the few i have watched and loved others being rome, prison break, american horror story & the walking dead.the game of thrones has very good characters and good actors for those characters, none of them are what they seem. the game of thrones is about struggle of power and what men/women can do get power.i would strongly recommend this tv series from hbo."
2012-05-19,overfiend_87,Believe the hype,9,"i hadn't watched this show at first, season 1 was finished by the time i started watching and i heard from many gamers (pen and paper roleplaying) that it was a truly amazing series and i assumed it to be good, but i found that it was great! there are few series out there where i can sit and watch the show, truly interested in every aspect of it. i sit there wondering about every single character. the important ones, the non,important ones, the vile ones and the good ones, the annoying ones and the enjoyable ones. character i absolutely loathe are so well written that i am always interested in what they are up to, what they're doing and what they'll do.there are quite a few twists where for one moment you think things are going to be okay and it's going to be a stereotypical order in the storyline and then all of a sudden the scene does a 360 on you and you have no idea where they're going with the storyline. everyone who watches this has their favourite noble family that they would like to win and have justice and take the throne. i personally want to support the under-dogs, the starks but i'm sure others like the other nobles in different parts of the world.i highly recommend this as i have never seen another fantasy series that was done well in so many years. if you are a lover of fantasy i'd go for it. magic rarely comes into it, but when it does, it is something truly powerful."

2019-04-22,schnicksy-1,Over hyped,1,"i know this will get down rated as a review because it's an unpopular opinion, but this show does not live up to the hype. i've watched each season as they've come along hoping see that special spark i'm missing. alas, i never do.two episodes into the final series and it's so boring. the dialogue is even more cheesy than in previous series and the acting seems even more wooden and forced. to the point i actually don't care what happens to any of the characters.there are better programmes out there. it's okay. it's not the best tv programme ever made.the earlier series were much better; as a programme it lost its way a couple of series ago."
2019-05-22,sush_gup123,A gem you get to see in a generation,8,"complex plot. rich character development.
action have consequences unlike most crappy fictions out there.
dots connect in a way you will be left with awe."
2019-05-20,terrencej31,Wow😠,9,horrible!!! worst episode every. i had this rated the greatest series of all time and it was the worst series finale i've seen. 20 minute conversations and skipped 3 weeks ahead.
2019-07-29,soulanalyst,"One of the best scripts for tv ever - complex, many characters, intertwined, intriguing...",9,"very well written script, interesting and very complex with many characters, also with good acting and visual effects. even people who are not fans of epic fantasy can watch this and find it interesting as series consists of many political power struggle, drama, romance, war etc. themes. for me personally the script is the core of any film or tv series and this one is brilliant with the first seasons being better than say the last season. maybe it's because they followed books more closely whereas the 8th book is not yet published.anyway, i highly recommend the series. it will draw you into the story and you'll live in a new world for the duration of the series."
2019-05-14,ace-computer-1,Season 8 Why do you exist ???,10,"season 1 ,5 was awesome , season 6 was good, season 7 was ok but season 8 is a total disappointment, so lets focus on season 8, the acting was good like always, i find no fault in any of the actors, but the directors and the story writers really dropped the ball and ruined a what was going to be a hall of fame series, as i make this review their is one episode left , hoping they redeem themselves even a little but i dough it , season 8 is a train wreck even more then lost, its very said and upsetting when i think about how i have watched this show loyally for 8 years and to be let down with total garbage writing like this, maybe they just didn't care at all because the series was ending , it sure seems so, in short season 8 writers go from hero to 0, but by all means watch it so you can see for yourself how they killed this series in the last season , it will make you scratch your head and wonder like i am"
2020-07-23,aljaz_kerc,A humble advice to the lone hipster who has delayed watching GoT till now...,9,"after finishing the series when it first aired, and sleeping on it in the style of a bear in winter, i think i finally formed a semi,cohesive opinion on this series without a need to rewatch the whole thing from start to finish. if you haven't watched this series yet, chances are you never will; unless you were to young to watch, or trully appreciate it, when it first came out, or if you are that proud local hero who has decided to walk against the current on this series- even if you felt like maybe watching it before, your stubbornness didn't let you stray of the course of action you started on. or maybe you just don't like fantasy- who can blame you- to each his own, i say! in any case, these next few words i got to say might help you decide whether to give this show the proper chance it deserves.game of thrones is one of the best shows ever made. period.defined as a fantasy drama with action and adventures, it explores a wide variety of themes in depth, doing an amazing job highlighting contrast and similarities, ironies and especially unpredictability and harsh realities of life. tried to sum it up in one sentence, and found it quite hard to mention everything that weighs on quality of anything i watch- that in itself either speaks of how diverse the show is or how incompetent i am, haha. about the background: if you don't already know (somehow), series is based on books by george rr martin, and since he hasn't finished the series yet, and the main directors d&d wanted to move on to other projects, the last few seasons aren't based on the incredible writings of grrm, but are written with his help (not enough of it, it seems now) by d&d. series based on books can be done right or wrong, and here the written word has been transformed onto pictures oh-so well. the sublime and powerful dialogues rival (or surpass) that of any a great show, since a lot of them are quite close to verbatim copies of the dialogues in the books. great cast can also be held responsible to bring world of got alive to this degree of credibility, there really isn't much else to say about this series, except for the sad last season. sad as in how rushed it feels throughout, the dialogues are generic and nowhere close to earlier seasons, plot takes a final turn that the writers later claimed they been building upon for several seasons, but was so poorly received by the audience and critics alike that the excuses didn't really matter. one of the biggest allures of this show is the many important and well-explored characters that followed their own plot line. a lot of these plot lines that i don't really need to name are built up throughout the whole series, and the last season dealt with all these plot lines extremely poorly, some characters became caricatures of their old self, making decisions that are the opposite of what the book-version or even the previous-season-of-the-show-version character would do; some plot lines were ignored, and others finished in humiliating manor. all in all, last season is seen by many as one of the worst series ending in tv history, throwing major shade on the rest of the series.
my advice: this show has a lot to offer. great action scenes, amazing script for most of it, interesting plot lines and unpredictable twists&turns. i believe the first majority of the show makes it worth the watch, even considering the disappointing final."
2012-06-29,webster422,Too many characters,9,"the main problem i have with this show is that there are too many characters to follow. even some producers or writers would agree that people who watch movies or tv cant follow 25,30 characters on a show. i'm impressed with some characters that i follow, but there are a bunch of characters i could care less about. not cause the actors are bad or the characters aren't interesting, but because following seven families and the members of the families is soap opera like.. this is a fantasy, medieval, story, not days of our lives. i hope to see maybe some sort filter or sorting of the characters and their significance to the story."
2019-05-14,pakiturri,Very disappointed,10,"to the producers: the story matters, the dialogs matter, the plotholes matter, the nonsense matters, the rushing matters. in three words: the writing matters. it's not only about the visuals, for f's sake. that should only account for 10,20% of the value of the series. so disappointed that the rest 80-90% has been thrown drown the drain. shame..."
2012-08-19,tomppa-724-147085,I haven't read the books,1,"im not a big fan of reading books. don't like it all. but, as i watched how good reviews game of the thrones i just thought for myself ""allright, i deeply hope that imdb doesn't screw this up nor the voters, so i give it a try"".i started to watch. maybe a bit slow start, didn't catch up everything, but as the series went on, i became more and more stuck. the characters are great in most part. many fit in their role very good. now i've finished the first season and all i can say is: wow! amazing. much nudity and curses, but that doesn't mean that these series sucks, its not that way! its a really great series and i like it much.hmh, im sure that its because i haven't read the books i don't understand completely everything, or i hope at least i understand most of the series (becouse this was my first season, gonna watch the second now) so.. i could've give this a 10/10 but i stick with a 8/10. one of the best series i've ever watched....so far, i hope season 2 is as good as this one, or better..i'll edit my post after season 2. so far 8/10i must say that peter dinklage as tyrion lannister is a superb character (and actor of course) there is no words to describe, no words. peter nailed it as tyrion. just simply amazing."
2019-05-26,har-har-mahadev,If you are starting it now stay away from this show.,10,"don't bother to watch this show if you are planning to watch game of thrones from start. season 8 doesn't justify this series. all the character development, plot, drama goes straight to drain. 7 years of awesome experience went downhill in 7 hours. just see the review graph and you will know why so many peoples are pissed.conclusion: 7 years of pointless drama to show democracy is good."
2011-05-25,santoute,absolutely brilliant,1,"i have seen may epic series and honestly got disappointed by many, so we stuck to drama series for the past years, i thought after lord of the rings , i would never witness something similar, i am not talking about the fantasy sci,fi but the whole emotion you get by just watching one scene i hurried and read ""song of ice and fire"" just to reduce my disappointment once i get to watch the series, but the trailer of game of thrones left me and husband in awe! brilliant choice of cast, i can't pick or criticize any of them, as if they were made for this role throughout their lives and sean bean, isn't he the greatest? can't wait to see more and more, i m in episode 6 now and looks very promising and each episode gets better .. thats is the only series/ movies i would rate a 10... well deserved, great job from hbo, always giving the best i really hope that epic fans enjoy this series as much as i do.. george rr martin will be very proud , a great author and a great adaptation"
2019-08-07,brynjar-onsoeien-rasmuss,"I loved it, and now i won't re-watch it",10,"for the seasons 1,4 were groundbreakingly beautiful. 5-6 was still amazing, although not at the same level as the beginning. 7 was slow and boring, i thought it built up to an amazing finale.
8, i was wrong. rushed, illogical and frustratingly disappointing."
2014-04-10,king-fahad-liaquat,"The season start with its epic, sprawling, bloody glory & satisfying climax",10,"game of thrones s4 came back with its epic, sprawling, bloody glory & start the season satisfying climax...! nothing can changes the mode that setting up from season 1 to 4. day by day the hunger for power is growing up from north to king's land. it's a greed beyond imaginable because the remaining players of got still adapting & trying to move things on there way and that's creating the story into widely possible angles. as its best, the every single season is completely unpredictable and meticulously detailed in its orchestration of pain and agony. this is a most marvelous tv series aside from the lost, i can't think of any on, screen story that creates such a vast, believable world out of imaginations."
2021-01-26,original_fire,Great until the final 3 episodes,10,"i used to be a huge fan of this series but the final three episodes ruined it.season 1 to 6: 10/10 season 7: 9/10
season 8: 5/10the only reasons i rated 5 stars in the final season are because of the first
three episodes, acting, cgi/vfx scenes, locations, etc. except the writing for the final three episodes. to be frank, it could have ended with the white walker arc and just end it right there. it's been nearly 2 years and i'm still frustrated the way they wrote the final three episodes. it's like a epilogue that should have been used as a deleted scenes. d & d should have taken the offer to extend the series to 10 seasons and they would have saved their reputation."
2019-05-26,ratnakarsid,Great Series but my story is better,9,"got is overall captivating and leaves you spell bound ...only issue which i had was plot twists are welcomed in start or middle of the season..if you do it in last episode of season..its unwarranted for..you leave people in anguish and no where to fall to..this was the only negative but overall it was a greatest show ever made..to mitigate the plot twist i have written a story of my own and it's far better..the plot started getting bleak in season 7 end when daenerys went to king's landing to have a truce with cersei instead she should have attacked kings landing and taken kings landing with cersei pleading.. she should have made largest living army..season 8 should have been all about fight between living and dead with greatest war anyone has ever seen..after winning the war daenerys would have claimed winterfell and her dragons firing at jon snow but jon snow comes out of fire being a targareyn and kills daenerys..all the people would have hailed jon snow as he came out of fire and with support of north,wildlings and dothraki and would have been a strongest king ever lived in 7 kingdoms."

2014-02-26,allyramsamy,Amazing - I absolutely love it,6,"i can honestly not fault the game of thrones. it took me along time to give in to all the people telling me to watch it, as i thought i would hate a show that focused around the years of kings and queens and dragons. i have never been interested in a show that is situated in a completely different time to our own. but i was so wrong in thinking that i would hate it, in fact i'd go as far as to say i love this show. it is honestly brilliant. while i have not read the books, i have read many reviews and apparently the show is very very similar to the books. which proves it is true to the story and obviously a great adaptation of george martins brilliant books ( he seriously needs to hurry up and finish the books). the only negative comment i have of this story is the fact that rob stark and his wife and baby died.... rob was my favourite character and i hate how easily he was killed off. but honestly while i hate they did this, i like how it depicts this time, and how no one is safe... because in most shows our favourite characters usually survive, but in game of thrones that is just not true. it doesn't matter who the character is, in fact im sure all the main characters will die. and while its sad, it makes you forget you are watching a tv show, and you easily lose yourself in the story. without a doubt in my mind, i would highly recommend this show! it is completely brilliant and a nice change from so many shows we watch today. it has changed my preferences of tv shows and movies so much, that now i am searching for shows that are a little similar to it. right now i'm watching the show reign, and i can't wait to introduce myself to a whole new genre of books, movies and tv shows. it really does change your opinion on what you think you like, all the while making you feel about 100000 emotions while you're watching it.if you have any doubts, don't. you will not be disappointed in watching this show :) i give it about 10000 thumbs up. happy reading/watching."
2013-07-21,ahmed_yasir1996,That's some addictive stuff !,10,"after watching the sopranos and breaking bad i saw the 9.4 rating of game of thrones and read the overwhelming reviews by critics.i am not interested in fantasy genre,especially over,hyped harry potter,lord of the rings and star wars.at first i thought game of thrones was something for kids and geeks and nerds,something with sword fighting or cult dialog. but boy,after watching the pilot i was so amazed i got hooked immediately. stannis baratheon and tywin lannister and my favorite.i still remember the speech by tyrion in s02e09,'those are brave men knocking on our door,let's go kill them!',his facial expressions were so real,the director is a real genius! having said that,i have and will not watch any other fantasy series or movie if it isn't as good as game of thrones."

2015-06-15,lightningsrl,Las episode of season 5,8,"considering episode 9 i was expecting much more from the season finale unfortunately there's only two words that can describe this last episode big disappointment ... if you add to that, that we have to wait one year for the next episode / season it becomes more than that, it becomes total failure with the added bonus of ruining the whole thing. so besides being total crap the actual story didn't develop much as you would expect from a season finale episode but on the contrary it left a total disappointment feeling. the show is one of the best currently there's no denying in that and it had up's and down's like all have and so far it was good and entertaining, too bad about this last episode it was like the creators run out of ideas / lack of inspiration / professionalism. i can understand to leave some things unresolved that creates the desire to see next season in viewers but to add new stuff and let them also (totally) unexplained is amateur work, it should have been an ""explosive"" season finale considering the previous episode which was very good and raised my expectations for the finale a lot. i wont probably remember next year to watch the next season because of the bitterness i felt with this season finale. shame ..."

2015-12-16,ahalida132,"When you play a Game of Thrones, you lose or you die, there's no middle ground.",10,"*contains spoilers*somewhere in the middle we expected a huge alliance between two great families that would end as peaceful bounds. we were waiting to see that it would be a grand celebration full of joy and reaching the long,awaiting revenge and winning a great war. but suddenly there were bloods everywhere, where every single member of present family was brutally killed and stabbed. that was horrifying and that was a red wedding. after that particular scene the interest grew to game of thrones making it a first classic recent novel and tv-show where unusually main characters either die or face the injustice. this is kingdom of westeros where brutality, cruelty, injustice, betrayal and hardships take place. this is a kingdom where brutal man rule and only the strongest survive. a place where you should be no more than a cunning bastard to survive everything by luring a young girl into a marriage against her will whereas to protect her. it's a world where no one pity you, no one feels sorry for anything. it's a place where a little girl survives on her own by taking life for granted. a family who's blind to see that power isn't everything. children gets the answer for the actions of their parents, a man who protects his brother gets his father killed, a whore who betrays, a devoted man gets killed for planning defense his own men. this is not just a drama, romance, crime or adventure. this is everything. every little scene, every little talk, even a gesture matters to understand game of thrones. every viewer may expect everything from the show. cause anything can happen. this is what makes it so incredibly exciting to follow. each episode is assured to be thrilling and captivating to watch. for those who will start watching it: it's so perfect and entertaining that you will be craving for more! this is a series that stays true to the book. the depth, the complexity and drama is very well captured in the series. it's very rare nowadays to see the film adaptation which is so close to the book. it's remarkable indeed. in every perspective it's bold, powerful and fantastic. and it's a fantasy that bites!"
2020-03-08,rsingh1240,"At it's best, one of the greatest of all time, at it's worst, yikes",4,"like many say, seasons 1,6 have some of the finest hours of television you'll ever see. excellent writing, intriguing characters, shocking deaths, it truly had it all. but all of that built up to a really weak, rushed final 2 seasons that completely failed to stick the landing. i'm not going to dump on d&d like most people do, i was angry and blamed them initially but after thinking about it for a bit i think they were destined to fail. it's easy to forget that those same 2 guys adapted the episodes from the first 6 seasons that moved you, made you cry, shocked the hell out of you, and were all around great tv. when they ran out of source material they were kind of given an impossible task, to try to weave together an insane number of thread that were initially created by someone else. even george rr martin himself cant seem to wrap them up, it's been 9 years since he released the last book and we still dont know when we're going to see it. if he's having trouble doing it then i dont know why anyone expected 2 guys with very little experience in writing their own stuff to be able to.now you can be mad at d&d for wanting to wrap it up as quickly as possible. i do think if they had stretched the final 2 seasons over 4 seasons and given some of the plot points time to breathe then maybe it wouldn't seem as bad as it did. i will always love the best parts of the show, but it will forever remain the greatest media disappointment of my lifetime. all of the hype leading up to it and seeing it fall flat on it's face was heartbreaking. and i feel bad for the cast and crew, the production was still firing on all cylinders. the visuals, the cinematography, vfx, costume design, production design, sound design was all top shelf as usual, but when the writing is bad none of that matters. writing is the foundation, and if it's weak the whole thing crumbles. oh what could have been."
2019-10-12,joshuaevanepstein,Rating Lowered From 10 to 7,10,"viewers deserved better than what the writers and producers gave them during the latter half of season 7, but much more so throughout season 8. the final season was rushed, as if the writers wanted to get this show over and done with while the finale was insultingly ridiculous.one main character's descent into madness in less than 2 episodes , having been perfectly sane for the preceding 70+ episodes - was comical, and clearly rushed. the writers had to know this was the direction the show was going long before those 2 episodes. they could have, and should have shown her descent into madness starting towards the end of season 7.but that finale? neither of the 2 ""good"" lead characters got to personally kill the two of you know who ""evil"" characters?! neither got to make them suffer?! they just get to die by ________ and that's that?!screw you, writers.i've never seen a more anticlimactic ending for characters that loyal viewers deserved, no, were owed to at least witness them die as painfully and torturously as all their monstrous acts over 8 seasons combined.i can't even begin to address who ended up on the thrown. i have no words."
2019-02-01,col-macara,Books vs. TV,10,"ok , so i stumbled upon ""a song of ice and fire"" after reading the first dunk & egg novella in the graphic novel adaptation. since reading the first book, i thought martin had just redefined sooooo many standards in fantasy literature but, at the end of the day , had written an incredibly complex and masterful story, periodthen news started to come out about tv adaptation , that was really, really frightening. the complexitiy , the subtelty, the richness, the vastness of martin's work was so hard to handle that i was fearing for the worst.i mean, how can you possibly transport tyrion form page to screen without loosing the characther soul, spirit , wit and depht? that's the kind of things i was worried about.so episode 1 was finally on the air, and when i sat and started to watch it i was prepared for the worst.but them i saw the men of the black watch getting trough the tunnel. no words spoken, no sounds but the horses' hoofs softly clopping the snow-covered soil. i just needed to see that first sequence to relax and dismiss all my fears. i said to my self : ""the lads really know what they're doing"". i watched the rest of episode 1 with half a smile on my lips, every charachter/actor choiche was incredible, and the small details diverting from the books - like sean bean dirty blonde hair vs. ned's black ones - were completely overriden by the actors' performances. and of course after witnessing dinklage doing his things the imagine of tyrion i had in my mind was definitely transformed into a new, dinklage-ish versionhaving said that, i still think the dorne plot was miserable -even if pedro was in-fu*§ing-credible as the red viper - so there are still thing in this show that can be put down to an human level......but overall this is still the closest thing to perfection one can imagine"
2013-05-05,gotgeek827809,Read the books!!!,8,"i watched season one when it aired and this prompted me to read the series. season one was very true to the books but season two was not! i understand that since the books are so large the writers cannot fit all the material in the show. this is fine. however, what is not okay is completely changing certain story lines and characters. season two did this too much! i did not enjoy it as much as season one. just to name a few , the nights watch story line, dany's story line, stannis, theon. i know i'm not the only one who thinks this- i've read several articles online and even non book readers have said season two dragged and was kind of boring. anyways the reason i gave the show a 10/10 is because they have redeemed themselves with season three! this is one of the best books in the series, so action packed! and the writers have done a great job showing this on television! however, i do highly encourage everyone i know who enjoys the show to dive into the books! they are beyond phenomenal and you will not be disappointed- i promise!"
2019-05-18,gowar_9200,Winter is coming! *Cough Cough*,10,"for seven years winter has been coming and finally it did. when 2 years ago they said season 8 would be the last season, and so i thought to my self they are rushing things because there are so many characters that will probably have their stories cut short because d&d wanted to get it done a bit quicker. and guess what i was write.when 2 years ago d&d announced that the last season will be only 6 episodes and that it would be the end for game of thrones, i throught o my self now they are really going to rush the season and push it to get it done. and again i was right.when 3 years ago they said the last battle will be the bloodiest and hardest i said for sure it will because they will be fighting white walkers and zombies, but guess what i was wrong. the battle at winterfell between the whites and mankind was probably the saddest and most hurried episode of them all!!!!! i fudging almost cried and wanted to tear my eyes out. i told my self this can not be d&d would not do this to the got fans but guess what i was wrong they actually did fudge us all over!the battle for survival at winterfell between mankind and the whites was the saddest, worst and shortest episode. it was hurried as if d&d wanted to get this over with and rob the people of the money they earn from our money which hbo earns by selling got to us viewers, because i think they felt that this is the chance for them to back down and take the money and run because if they keept on going they would soon lose viewers being that they already destroyed season 7.you have lost 1 more fan d&d, and also to everyone at hbo i want a refund of my many years of subscription for the betrayal and your arrogance in letting those two nuts d&d take this beautiful show and destroy it for us all.this season was t the shortest and most rushed season with no plot only a goal, where the characters only stare at each other, the hole season was a stare down and talking hookers, ale, wine, fighting and last but not least the crown. they left all the other plot lines from season 1,6 in the dumpster which they threw season 7 in. d&d i wish you no ill will but i truly do hope you never get a directing job ever again after this both of you, and the writing was horrific. the acting was so fudging stale you could cut the tension with a butter knife and still it would hurt but i do not blame the actors. they are the only good thing in this show together with george rr martin one of the best writers of all time. d&d trully fudged the hole crew over all the actors as well as george so will not blame them for this season being horrific but i will blame hbo and d&d."
2019-05-20,lampyswift,What has TV come to?,10,"i remember days when good tv involved decent actors producing serious performances that gave you hard,hitting drama and kept you gripped. fast forward 10-20 years and i'm seeing hollyoaks rejects playing dungeons and dragons and ending up higher ranked than a show like the wire. the world has gone mad."
2020-04-11,dymogauk,One Of The Best Forms Of Media I Have Seen,10,"season 1,6= 10/10 season 7= 8/10
season 8= 6/10season 1-6 of game of thrones is masterful, some of the best television, or story i have seen. character deaths, shocking, engaging, fantastic dialogue, incredible twists, intense, awesome battles, violent, incredible story and nuanced and complex characters with incredible world building and characters that you just fall in love with, with incredible arcs (jaime, cersei, jon, tyrion, danerys, robb, ned etc)
there is no other tv show like game of thrones 1st 6 seasons, no other tv shows gives you the same feeling as episodes such as- baelor, the rains of castamere, blackwater, battle of the bastards, laws of gods and men, the winds of winter, hardhome, mother's mercy etc.
game of thrones s1-6 are easily a 10/10.season 7 isn't as good as those 6 seasons, its still great television with awesome episodes such as the spoils of war and 'the dragon and the wolf' and jaimie and cersei lannister are the best they've been (my personal favourite 2 characters). but the pacing feels a bit off, ep 5 and 6 feel rushed, disjointed and more generic. it's a set up season for s8 and while its still a great season of tv, you can see where it started to go a bit downhill. still a solid entry in the got saga.season 8 is hugely disappointing, great battles, music, production and acting.
the story, characters, pacing and writing are not good. it's too crammed with too many stories and characters to fit in only 6 episodes and the ending of the long night negates the entire theme of game of thrones, leaving for a disappointing 2nd half. also, what they did with jaimie lanister and the night king is unforgivable, got always shocked fans with great twists, but in s8 it's shocking at the expense of telling a good story.even tho s8 is disappointing, got is still absolutely worth the watch, its one of a kind tv show and the first 7 seasons are 100% worth watching."
2019-05-20,majidbashir61,I edited my rating after the end,10,"so after what i saw in the finale of the series. i had to edit from 10/10 to 7/10.. season 8 was garbage... they ruin the book the storyline the great conversations and everything.
the actors did great job but the writers were miserable in the last episodes."
2017-03-23,shibbs34,"BEST SHOW EVER (Yes, Even better than Breaking Bad & Sopranos)",1,"this show is simply amazing in every aspect possible, from the acting to the visuals & one of the most overlooked aspects, the score (music) of the series. this show is truly captivating in more ways than one. it's everything an ancient war fantasy should be & more. the plot & character development are nearly perfect as you you follow the 7 kingdoms through their story lines, and each season gets better. i've seen breaking bad, sopranos among many other great shows & as amazing as those are, this is the show. i promise with just a few episodes you will be hooked, trust me! and not to mention the show has so many plot twists that you literally have no idea what could happen next, easily a 10/10 & my favorite show of all time. this show will suck you in from an emotional standpoint to the point where you will become a fiend for more, just like i'm dying for season 7 as we speak"
2019-09-12,vincentfoti,An amazing show with a terrible ending,10,"man, i loved game of thrones for a while there. for about 5 seasons it was one of the best shows on tv. but the quality of writing starts to seriously drop off around the 5th season, and then drives of a cliff in the 8th season. the writers (david benioff and db weiss) did an adequate job of adapting the source material at first. but once they were forced to write for themselves, they tipped their hand at how poorly suited they were for the job. to make matters worse, they abandoned the series to go work on other projects, making the last season feel rushed, and haphazard. they couldn't have ruined the show any more if they tried. so in conclusion, everything you've heard about got is true. great show, great characters, great acting, great special effects. but the final season is garbage. the biggest disappointment in television since dexter! this series is well worth your time, but be prepared to walk away dissatisfied and disheartened."
2020-08-15,ozgeecil,Season 1-4 great,8,"it's great untill season 4 but than it feels like they're just making the show perfunctory, therefore gets boring. the scenes and costumes are great though."
2011-06-23,casanis,Do something else,2,"end of the first season : 10 episodes for about 10 hours. and what did it happen ? almost nothing. one,dimensional stereotyped characters ""we don't care"" lost in infinite boring dialogs and a simple story who can stand in a stamp (i don't know about the books but i hope it's more consistent). but you could say ""forget the story, it's question of atmosphere"". ok. look inside : the decor are cardboard made and look fake. and you often stay inside because outside it's not so easy to cheat. also this is not an heroic fantasy story. there is no fantasy at all... except at the end of the last minute of the last episode. before it's just like middle-age. medieval stuff (sorry dardaryen steel looks like ordinary steel) and barbarians ways (with a touch of dismemberment). of course you have free nudity but completely pointless.to sum up it's a very mediocre entertainment you have to avoid at all cost not to lost 10 precious hours of your life ! so do something else..."
2013-05-30,sgp-12345,A Special Show!!!,9,"i have not read the books, a song of ice and fire by george r.r. martin, nor have i watched the show live from the beginning years, but i had heard good things and a lot of hype about game of thrones, so i thought, as a fantasy and medieval type fan, i would check it out. and boy, am i happy i did!! from the very first episode and particularly about midway through the first season, i was totally hooked onto this show.now, you learn pretty quick the mood and tone set by this show. i am a huge fan of the lord of the rings and to a lesser extent the chronicles of narnia, but this show, even though at times feels like those, is really anything but. it has a much darker, meatier edge to it, sometimes almost feeling too intense for some people. due to this, it will certainly not be a show that will please all audiences, but for others, it will make what is great about this show, the unpredictability. what makes this show so special though is the story of all the characters, the sets, and the writing. also, when i say all the characters, i mean all the characters as there are at least 20 characters that you will know by the time you have caught up watching the show thus far. though its very complex and sometimes can feel hard to keep up with every character's story, the show does a brilliant job at balancing all the character's off that you feel like you know each and every one individually. the dialogue between the characters feels fresh, intense, and just down right gritty. but its this dialogue that keeps you focused throughout every scene. the cast also is simply incredible led by peter dinklage as tyrion lannister, emilia clarke as daenarys targaryen, lena headey as cersei lannister and maisie williams as arya stark. again, with all the characters, that is only a select few, but others are just as deserving of these accolades.i personally caught up with the show in just under one week watching, as i absolutely did not want to stop watching, wondering what would happen next in the revolving story as your feelings towards characters change, and characters you grow to love suddenly have things, let's just say, don't go quite the right way for them. i am not going to compare it to other classic shows of the past, as i have never been the biggest television watcher. but all i can say is that even though this show has a lot of things that are quite intense in the form of violence, language or nudity, it doesn't ever feel like its the focus as the real themes here are family, politics, and loyalty. it's an experience to watch each and every episode, and i can't wait to continue on the journey with all these characters. as daenarys says most notably in one scene: dracarys!!!"

2015-02-17,majortrojan_2000,Quite simply the best new TV series ever made.,10,"game of thrones is the best tv series ever devised. there can be no competitors for its sheer scale, rich tapestry of characters, story, and wealth of talent on display.its almost an amusing slice of irony that a show of this scale, in all its enormous budget, sets, that the absolute best character and actor is the smallest of them all in the superb peter dinklage.some of the scenes may seem shocking in their graphic nature, indeed some may even seem gratuitous in their almost gleeful portrayal but this just lends to increasing the unerring fascination that series has generated in its fanbase.the only drawback, if you could really call it that is the seeming penchant that the author george rr martin has for killing off some of the best and most beloved characters before you really have a chance to explore what could happen with their development.a sure sign of a excellent series with absolutely spot on casting is the ability to create characters that can genuinely stir up deep dislike, almost loathing in their total evil natures.king joffrey, portrayed by the excellent jack gleeson has generated such hatred that he has publicly stated his occasional run ins with fans who seem to struggle with detaching the character from the actor.following on from joffrey are other equally despicable characters such as cercei lannister (lena headey) and melisandre the scarlet witch (carice van houten) that also deliciously bestow their characters with seemingly limitless cruelty and all round nastiness.to counterbalance however have been such brilliant characters portrayed by established stars such as sean bean, iain glen, charles dance and aiden gillian.to go through a thorough review of all the characters that are so incredibly portrayed would take far too long to cover with any kind of depth.what has been an extremely smart move by the producers has been the casting of young and previously unknowns such as kit harrington and maisie williams who clearly have impressive careers ahead of them, almost solely due to game of thrones being a springboard for their careers. as is always the case there is a fear that thrones may not last long enough, seemingly hollywood has an unhealthy fetish for all good series to last no more than 7 seasons. this is one of those shows that could genuinely be a far longer running story that would continue to enthrall an enormous fan base that would only ever grow with each subsequent episode.i am an extremely harsh reviewer and don't pull any punches when i feel a movie or tv show has ballsed up or not followed anything near to what the fans want or expect, however in this rare circumstance i cant find a single fault with this superb tv show. if you watch it in a blu ray boxset (i recommend you do, this show is worth investing in the tech to watch in good quality high definition) then make sure you set aside a full weekend because once you start, you'll be hooked before you know it.seriously, game of thrones is just that good."
2019-05-20,crodpics,Horrible last season,1,"for the first 7 seasons this show builds up amazing stories, characters and development. once you get to the last season you just end up like what the hell? many holes and questions within the stories in the show.
very disappointed on season 8."
2018-03-12,ajholman1998,Possibly the best television series ever created in the history of mankind.,10,"i only started watching this show last summer on sky box,sets, but i can honestly say this show is simply incredible. firstly, this show is a medieval fantasy-drama but it is unlike any other fantasy film or television series you have ever seen. the show is based on george r.r. martin's acclaimed 'a song of ice and fire' novel series and it is an outstanding adaption of these great books. in later seasons, the show manages to heavily deviate from the book's contents and have actually surpassed the book series, and many characters who are deceased in the show are still alive in the books but the show's writers and producers have all managed to pull this off with spellbinding results. what carries this brilliant show is its numerous, but remarkably strong storytelling which manages to bewitch the viewer on the very first episode. many of the shows characters, are instantly memorable and lovable, even the villains. all of the acting is outstanding and many of the show's stars deserve all their awards and should receive casting roles for their fabulous work on thw show. the medieval scenery on the show is incredibly realistic and believable it manages to send the viewers back in time. the settings are beautiful and filmed with exquisite precision in some of the most stunning parts of the world. furthermore, the special effects and cgi are film-worthy and is what really brings this magical show to life.
i don't wish to spoil a single plot point but all intelligent viewers and lovers of fantasy fiction should watch this show. everyone i know who has watched has become instantly addicted so be prepared to be blown away. it is definitely not overrated in the slightest and is very worthy of your time and consideration. i consider it to be the most remarkable television series ever created by man. grade a."

2014-06-16,jaydoubleu84,Did you read the books?,7,"after reading some of the reviews here, i was very amused, mostly about the strong contrast in positive and negative opinions. first of all, just to clarify, i agree with the majority. i love the show, and it's great. as good and as mindblowing awesome as breaking bad? no, probably not. that is just not possible. therefore i gave it only a 9, and it's anyway a bad idea to compare shows with each other. when you review got, or read reviews, or watch it, or plan to watch it, there is one thing you have to keep in mind. have you read the books? people are complaining about the plot, the enormous amount of characters, the constant dying of those characters, and the slow pace. well, considering that this show is based on literature of epic dimensions, the show is doing a great job adapting to it. if you haven't read the book, the amount of characters and the storyline, might be confusing to you. although the story has been already simplified. the slow pace is just a huge build,up, for the last books to come, what i expect to be one hell of a showdown. if you don't like nudity and violence, don't watch the show and don't read the books. if you think it's to much to see an actor brother and sister pretending to have sex, well, don't watch the show. my advice to anyone out there is to read the books. i did, and the show for me is now a tightly packed summary of them. does it bother me? no, because i know how difficult and complicated it must be, to produce this show. so when forming your own opinion about got, keep one thing in mind. the books. have you read them, or not?"

2020-11-08,roro998,Great series,9,"very well written and reproduced in screen. the plot is too good. the character development is outstanding. each and every character has their good side and bad side put forth. you really can't predict what is going to happen, who is good, who is bad, whose side are you on , the series kept it so unpredictable throughout. the series stayed true to its potential till the 3rd episode of season 9 - the battle of winterfell. outstanding visuals, great extended battles - each and every battle is portrayed in detail, has its moments of satisfaction and disappointment for the audience. undoubtedly one of the greatest series of all times. start watching only if you have time - it's another world and it will take some time to come out of it once you are in just like the harry potters and lotrs."
2014-06-08,anniebiz85,The Love of My Life,6,"this show is masterfully produced, with a writer like grrm that isn't a sell out you can be certain that plenty of respect is given to the books story lines. there are no mobs of angry book fans like so many other adaptations. the development of characters, the intertwining of plot lines, the acting, locations, wardrobe, set dressing, every hair on every head and every jewel on never neck is flawless. just an absolutely captivating series. here are my two wishes:1) ed skrein to play daario naharis instead of the current vanilla dude 2) for me to never know of got until 10 years from now, so i can watch all 15 seasons in a row without waiting. then die happily of malnutrition and skin ulcers. yay :)"
2019-05-20,ralf-koller,Just watch episode 1-70...,10,...and it's a 10 forget about the 3 final ones and imagine the outcome you want.
2015-02-18,angush,A Masterpiece,5,"game of thrones is an intense, action packed, twisted tv series that goes against all rules of a tv show. main characters die left right and center anywhere and at anytime. the unpredictable nature of the show makes every episode intense, that kept me captivated and eager to watch the next episode. the vast array of characters and factions creates good discussion as most of the characters are likable and it is hard to pick favorite. the amount of story lines, characters, places, factions, names, people is huge and always kept me on my toes. to truly understand the story you have to understand the back story as well, which makes it all the more complicated. this is why i loved the show, as there is so much you can talk about, discuss and argue over. overall i think game of thrones is an amazing show, the characters, the plot depth, the action, the interaction and relationships between characters, the character development. everything about the show is brilliant. the show is captivating, interesting and if it starts to get boring there is always something big about to happen just around the corner. the unpredictability of the show always keeps the viewers on edge, as you don't know who will die next or what will happen in the next episode. i think this is one of the best tv series at the moment with superb acting and one heck of a story line. overall i give game of thrones my tick of approval and i would recommend anyone and everyone to watch it if they haven't already."

2019-05-21,bravecaveman,Worthless after season 8,6,honestly i could write about all the things wrong but as a fan i just feel let down and the series was ruined all those good moments ruined wont ever watch again ........
2020-04-13,lottydottypotty,Incredible,1,this was the best show i have ever seen _ kept me on the edge of my seat
2019-05-22,tannerlu,Overrated. Avatar the Last Airbender is better.,10,"review pretty much sums it up. the last season was mediocre, the ending was a disaster. it's still a great show, don't get me wrong, and the first few seasons are still great if you'd consider watching. sad that it had such a rushed and sloppy execution the last few seasons of what was once a gloriously detailed, rich and immersive fantasy series.edit: i changed my rating from a 6 (which i believe is accurate when assessing the series as a wholes) to a 1 to bring the ratings down. it does not deserve a 9.3.i've also thought more about how gratuitous the violence and sexual assault is in this show. not only is it unnecessary and sensationalist, it's ahistorical. i am a history major and my medieval history professor made a point to point out the historical inaccuracies in this show. yes, it's fantasy, but it still perpetuates negative false stereotypes about medieval life."
2019-02-02,rdempsey1970,One word to describe GOT ...phenomenal!!,10,this got to be the greatest tv series ever !!! and i can't see anyone match this !!!simple awesome and phenomenal
2014-07-04,lacrosse9725-45-705775,Most Well-Made TV Show I've Ever Seen,10,"game of thrones is a beautiful adaption of its famous books. drama at every corner, action at the blink of an eye, this tv show sets the standard for any genre of tv to a new high. the performances are amazing, the special effects are stunning, and the plot has so many twists and turns you'll be begging for more and more. i started watching this show just to see what all the hype was about and boy did it exceed my expectations. i finished all the seasons in a matter of weeks (i had a lot of free time on my hands). while its a long show (each episode is about an hour or more long) it is well worth the watch and it can turn even the sportiest bro into a warlock,loving nerd."
2019-04-21,mmjnr10-71-780778,I think it's best screen art work ever made period!,10,i really think got is better than any movie or tv series that i have ever seen and i have seen them all and i mean and nothing comes even close including lord of the rings saga and even the godfather trilogy... hope to live and see something that could come close or eclipse got wether movie or tv show
2018-08-25,gemordi,"Great, but probably ending at the right time.",10,"this has been an incredible series, not much more that can be said after reading all the reviews that have been posted. this series has had everything and if you read the early reviews it is clear that no one could see some of the twists that were coming. the series is about eddard stark? i don't think so!but i think the series has lost a bit of momentum since it overtook the books, but it is still a great watch and it will be fascinating to see how they wrap it all up.all in all, one of the best series ever to grace television, and it has been a joy to watch. will always be one of the best shows that we have the pleasure to watch, even if the last series hasn't quite lived up to the early shows. still, an incredible achievement."
2019-11-26,abhiramreddy48,"WHOEVER APPROVED THE SCRIPT FOR SEASON 7&8 AT HBO, PLEASE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE DRUG AND WHERE I CAN FIND IT",2,"this series has been exceptional through its first six seasons. i used to recommend the show to people that haven't watched it. now after season 8, i steer people away from watching the show.anyone will love the first six seasons, but it isn't worth the heartbreak you will experience after watching the final two seasons. you spend all this time talking about the show, the characters, the subplots, speculating the ending. but what you get is bad dialogues, plot holes, unsatisfactory story, an epic battle that you literally can't see, some complicated characters becoming bots, some heroes just fading into the background, some heroes turning villains unnecessarily and of course the worst possible ending.don't believe the critics and people that say they liked the ending. what they are encouraging is mediocrity. if i have to say few things that keep the final two seasons above water, they are, the music, the production sets and the actors.netflix executives that hired david & dan for $250 million, really? you spent that much money on mediocrity?i don't recommend anyone watch this series because the payoff isn't worth it."
2019-05-22,alzaem7920,Thank u GOT,9,"best show ever although season 8 was the worst , we know why because dave and dan :)"
2020-01-10,ali_zergham,I came to RE-RATE it after 4 years,7,"so it had been one of my favorite show for such a long time.the first four seasons were pure gold. five and six were good and enjoyable but then came the seventh season and somehow the show,runners decided to put common sense and logic aside and started making some total bs decisions. but for some people, it was still watchable. i thought may be the finale which is taking way too much time (little less than 2 years) would be worth it and exceed my expectations. but god i was wrong? it did exceed my expectations with each new airing episode but for the worse. the final season outdid every dimension; acting, cinematography, the music. but the writing was so childish and nonsensical, it destroyed the whole show forever. if someone is planning to watch it, please save yourself a lot of time and don't. but if you really wanna see it, watch it with this in mind ""you are gonna be disappointed by the ending"". got will be remembered as a phenomenal show that got a bad ending."
2019-05-21,melanie-carter,"Intrigue, politics, passion and a great ending.",9,"i can't believe viewers are slating the ending of this show. not sure what on earth else they would have wanted from it. got has to be the best show and possibly the finest work of art that has ever been seen on our screens, ever. and by a country mile too.
we were gripped for years and the ending was absolutely beautiful. it didn't try for any hollywood cheese. it was honest, emotional, ticked every box and left a smile.
loved it."
2019-05-16,sot-gatsos,Winter never came.,7,"7 seasons waiting for the night king to show up. 7 seasons of meaningless build up, nearly of every major character. i couldn't be more disappointed. 8th season ruines everything. if i already knew this, i wouldn't bother spending so much time on this crap."
2019-05-24,doomcro1,Great adaptation softened by original content and then completely ruined by the ending.,9,"tl;dr once one of the best tv shows in history with the ending so bad that i can't recommend anyone to watch it and invest their time in it.it's hard to even go online these days and google ""game of thrones"" without bumping into articles or even memes about how the show declined in quality with every season. and unfortunately, it is all true.while the directors d&d had to adapt the books, this show was a piece of art. amazing visuals, great acting, stunning soundtrack, smart dialogue, a true modern day tv wonder which leaves you in awe and makes you appreciate the whole cast and crew.
after 4 seasons, when they had to come up with the original content since they ran out of books to adapt, the show started to fall off. rushed pacing, less impressive dialogue, but the plot was still interesting and production was getting even better.
season 7 was a bit of a mess, yet still at moments enjoyable. unfortunately it was only a taste of what was coming with season 8.season 8 is where it all went downhill. pacing so rushed that almost each episode could be a season of its own, all the logic previously shown, all the character developments, foreshadowing of plots, tension buildups, absolutely everything that they built for 8 years has been thrown out of the window for the sake of some visually impressive but rushed mindless spectacle, culminating in the worst and most illogical ending i ever saw in any tv show, including infamous endings of lost and dexter.
season 8 is the reason why i rate this 5 instead of at least 9.
season 8 is the reason why i see no point in ever rewatching this series as i sometimes do with some of my favourite shows.
season 8 is the reason i could never recommend this show to someone who hasn't watched it, because i can't tell someone to invest their time into something that ends so poorly.
season 8 should for ever go down in history as an example for young generations of directors, to show that no matter how good of a show you make, bad decisions can ruin years of hard work of everybody on that set. and those people are the ones i am the most sad about."
2019-04-26,stefanovictijana,It would be 10 if..,6,"season 7 was better than season 8. .. ap to season 6, i was fascinated.... season 7 hm... a bit mellow, and first two episodes of season 8... well, it felt like i'm watching some soap opera from india, where they grab the doorknob on fridey and open the door on mondey... long glases, slow motion and not a thing to happen.... and they are lazy... only 6 episodes.... well lazy and rich 😏"
2017-03-09,royeabelman,SO good,10,"this show is a thrilling roller,coaster ride, with so many twists and unexpected events.every episode brings something new to the table and it is so good. to anyone waiting out on this show... go watch it. believe me it's worth it.i cant wait to see what the rest of this show brings! my score for game of thrones: 10/10"
2019-05-13,rickwag-26633,Season 8 is the worst crime against the best show,1,i love got. i think it's the best show ever which is why season 8 is a crime. it's laughable. a total joke and terrible. so sad
2013-12-07,sirjamesddj,A lazy and raunchy series for those that enjoy watching injustice played out,10,"this show started with promise, as i'm a huge sean bean and medieval fan...but with an absolutely nauseating amount of gratuitous and unnecessary sex and gore, my opinion turned sour very quickly. i don't consider myself high brow, but the sex and violence in this show for the most part is geared towards a simple,minded audience...which i'm not a grunting ape so i necessitate more than that. oh and lest i forget, i could overlook a bunch of the raunchy scenes if not for the unbelievably irritating character of joffrey. that little puke completely ruins this show as i get so annoyed every time he's on screen that i grit my teeth and can't even watch. by the 7th episode, i was done and sent back my unopened second season to amazon.furthermore, ned, his illegitimate son, and sword fighting daughter are the only likable characters. however, they get mucked over at every single turn with no repercussions...which i choose to voyeur into escapism in order to get away from injustice, not watch more of it.i'm amazed at the high praise this trash gets, but i suppose it's a social commentary on what the current populous thinks is entertainment.sorry i wasted my time."

did arya went braavos just to show up her faceless thing for once or twice? why building such plots?
why killing petyr baelish, so soon when we all knew he was the man who build most game pf thrones plots?
there are lots of plots and stories went incomplete. poor writing."

2017-09-17,owenchou,Game of thrones season 7 review: Epic Season with some disappointment,10,"overall, i felt this was a solid season for game of thrones. but the pacing of each episode did bother me. some people just jumps from one location to another so fast that it's not believable. but that did not stop me from enjoying the crap out of myself with season 7. many people have previously complained that game of thrones went downhill after season 4. and a lot has to do with george rr martin's departure from the show. the writers gained creative freedom while george rr martin is focusing on his books. i feel like when you look at game of thrones on a technical standpoint, it excels every season. the action and the cinematography is way better compared to what it was back in season 1. but i do agree that the writing did go downhill from season 4. but not in a way where it completely ruins the show because the action in recent seasons is just cinema masterpiece. but as of season 7, i'm pretty sure everyone agrees that the spoils of war episode was the best of the season. everything from the build up of the dothraki screams and the fear from the lannister soldiers clearly shows how intense war is. a lot of this achievement has to do with the stunt team and all of the talented cgi artists working on this. game of thrones is the only tv show that is comparable to a movie in terms of the technical side. shows from the cw or abc just looks really cheap compared to game of thrones. but as of the entire story of game of thrones, it does feel very rushed. a lot has to do with the limited amount of episode it has this season. another aspect of the show that is lacking is the unpredictability of events. this aspect was what originally made game of thrones so great and it's kind of disappointing how it's pretty easy to guess how things would end. but negatives aside, this show is still the best i've ever seen and will have. everything from the cinematography to the action and locations, it's truly hard to not be stunned by the achievements of the show runners. i would say that season 7 is the most gorgeous looking season of game of thrones and maybe even of all tv shows.in this lastest season i would say that daeneryes targaryen is the best character because of the amount of character development given to her. she went from being a ruthless killer (burning rayndall and dickon) to a rightful queen. she sacrificed a dragon and jon clearly sees that she has a great heart, which eventually leads him bending the knee to her and pledge himself to house targaryen. other performances that was great is the whole lannister sibilings. i believe that lena heady will win an emmy next year because of how great she is playing this character. as for tyrion, c'mon, hes awesome and deserves another emmy even though he already has two. and jamie lannister was just brilliant because the emotional conflict he has about siding with cercei towards the end.+: action, dialogue (dragon and the wolf), cinematography, locations, costumes, set design, and all the characters. (loved euron in the first few episodes),: fast pace editing, 7 episodes (inner fanboy wants more episodes), predictibility, story telling (not bad but not as good as the first few seasons)"
2020-05-15,mohak-62115,AMAZING,10,simply stunning even with the lackluster final episode the production values cinematography and the sheer effort and plot makes this show one of the greatest to ever exist it's simply too good
2016-01-15,zimiscrazy,A Plebe Show:,9,"game of thrones is a poorly adapted show that is well suited for plebes. it is not a faithful adaptation of song of ice & fire series. this show had lots of unnecessary changes that infuriated me. the showrunners replace many important scenes with meaningless garbage. got ends up missing important scenes and dialogue from the books. got lacks any substance, and creativity. the showrunners made too many mistakes. got does not deserve praise, but scrutiny. critics should be embarrassed for praising game of thrones. no reviewer is that stupid. this show has too many problems to be praised. i personally think that the showrunners simply bribed the critics into giving the show a positive review. no reviewer would ever give a 9.5 average rating on imdb for this sh@t. unless he was bought. got list of problems: 1. poorly written characters (dull, & boring generic characters). 2. lack of foresight when writing these characters. 3. lack of development. 4. poorly structured story. 5. each season is crammed into one book. the seasons should have focused on one book. we would have ended up with better written characters and a fleshed out story. 6. miscast characters. 7. missed scenes: many key details missed. 8. not a cohesive story. got masquerades as a good series. the truth is that game of thrones is nothing but an overrated pile of sh@t. all got has going for it is sex and violence. the success of game of thrones is attributed largely to the plebes' lack of taste. this show is made to entertain plebes. if you doubt the review i had written. please go back and read the books. you would see that game of thrones is nothing but a missed opportunity."
2016-12-01,gypsyking878,"A dark, gritty, twisted fairy-tale. Beautiful, poetic, ruthless and unforgettable!!!",10,"i never, ever write reviews, but got has definitely earned it. bold, shocking storytelling at it's finest. it's really no wonder why got is hailed as the most popular, most awarded and most critically acclaimed show ever. if you're not a fan of the fantasy genre, you might dismiss thrones as hobbit hype or '' fantasy crap' but you'd be wrong. it's in the hbo tradition of the wire, the sopranos, deadwood and westworld, a big,budget tour of a fictional world with its own moral rules, where rival families battle for control and power. the political intrigue, mysteries and suspense will suck you in, even if you know nothing about politics. every aspect of got is near pefection, from the story, to the actors, to the characters, to character development, acting, plots, plot-twists, red-herrings, locations, costumes, sets, action sequences, battles, visuals, cgi, soundtracks, buildup, script, dialogue, everything is extremely detailed and polished. adapted from george.rr.martin's literary monstrosity, published in 1996, hbo's adaptation has stayed true to the story's roots (even if it has taken some major liberties). it addresses thousands of different themes ranging from the loss of innocence, to war, peace, love, hate, sex, sexuality, philosophy, vengeance, religion, culture, art, music, politics, economics, metaphysics, anthropology, justice, law, morality, spirituality, intolerance, prejudice, civilization, poetry, chaos, global warming, nihilism, pantheism, the destruction of nature, loss of humanity, childhood, adventure, magic, fear, illusions, manipulation, power, death, life, grief, violence, rape, incest, beauty and so.. got is filled with magic and the occult but always in a realistic and ominous way, never too widespread or too obvious giving it a sense of realism and mystery that other fantasy stories never have. got is also well known for it's shock factor and brutal unpredictability. always expect the unexpected when watching got and try not to get too attached to characters as none are safe (ever). that being said, got is without a doubt one of the greatest shows in the history of television. an instant cult masterpiece and a perfect example of unity in form and function. a must watch for everyone above 18."
2016-03-19,nymeros_martell,An event that extrapolates completely the television media.,10,"with the root the most extraordinary story written in the last half century, game of thrones can now be considered a single event in television history, and one of the most epic unique moments of popular culture. with a unique production and performances mostly superb, hbo has managed to create something that goes beyond all barriers of television media. characters without manichaeism in a world without heroes incontestable. a complex and fascinating universe filled by intricate political intrigue. a real lesson of geopolitics, military science and political science. apart from all the credits due to the mind of george r. r. martin, we can never forget the brilliant work of creators that, every year, in a space of six months, can produce ten episodes of such high production."
2019-09-22,jcottle-76670,A tragic ending.,10,"this show had everything. brilliant writing, acting, casting.. it had everything. and it threw it all away in the final season. the last season of this show utterly undid everything that came before. i won't even be able to re,watch this show because it's all so pointless after knowing how it ends."
2020-07-02,agustinaw-37444,The best series in history if ..,10,"the series is incredible in story, character development, acting, set design, and music. undoubtedly the best
but from season 7 the great dialogues and character development are lost, giving rise to iverosimile situations difficult to believe. so if i have to qualify seasons 1,6 i give it 10 stars"
2021-08-31,doubleg1915,How to ruin a show,9,"as much as i wanted to rate this highly i just can't. after falling in love with the series during the first 5 seasons, it started going downhill quick. i'll rate each season separately.1,4: 10/10- the writing here is just masterful, and i'd go as far to say it's the best writing in any show or movie period, it even surpasses my favorite show breaking bad. there are so many plots and a deep, rich world to explore. these are some of the best written characters, every one of them. they have clear motives, what they do makes sense, there is suspense and tension but the pacing is still engaging. good action scenes. overall just the pinacle of television, you just can't wait for the next episode.5: 7/10 here is where the directors had to start making up the story as they didn't have the books to follow, and the result is just bad at times. about 50% of the story is made up so that's probably why it's not as worse as it could be. some of the storylines like jon snow's are still interesting though, overall a good season, does not ruin the show for me.6-7: 5/10 i would say that i enjoyed 6 quite a bit more than 7 but objectively they are both not that great. it's fun to see all of the storylines created in the first 4 movies start to get closed, and a lot of fanservice is shown like daenerys finally showing off her adult dragons and destroying everything in her path, or jon snow beating the boltons. these moments are indeed great, but they only exist because of the build up created in the first 5 seasons and nothing more. the visuals are top tier though, this is the best visual effects team on television for sure. we already see the dialogue and overall narrative start becoming bad.8: 2/10 this season is just taking everything that was built previously and taking a dump on it. the writing is absolutely terrible and there were so many better, more simpler ways to close the narrative in a satisfying manner, but they couldn't do that. this is a bad attempt at grrm style writing by very incompetent writers (tried to pull of a red wedding type plot twist). what saves this from 1/10 are the visuals."
2019-05-06,elnur_r,The best TV show ever!,10,"this tv show literally the only thing i can watch now, maybe it's just for now. but, in fact, you can feel this world, you can guess whatever you want, and you will be wrong, in game of thrones everything is not like you think. and, including, 8th season, it's still the most emotional tv show ever. actors, actions, death and everything is on high level. got is amazing!"
2019-05-29,jasonwhite-19878,"6 perfect, one good and a dreadful end.",10,"i've always believed got was game changing, a brilliant, intelligent show which increasingly challenged cinema for visual wonder. the development of characters and story was well paced and careful, to the point where you believed it, a true achievement in a fantasy show. unfortunately the last season undoes all that. after a strong start with episodes one and two, which felt like they were from earlier seasons, it's down hill all the way. the best thing i could say about the last episode was ""meh"", which is a sad way to feel after so many perfectly crafted seasons."
2019-06-03,devanshimishra,Best piece of Fiction ever!,10,this is the best piece of fiction written or televised ever ..wish i could give 11 stars .
2016-07-03,rene4096,9.5 for Game of Thrones? That can't be right...,10,"well, the show is good, no discussion there but a 9.5 (july 3rd 2016) is quite overrated to my opinion. ratings like that are more echoes of the past that lack present reality.the first 3 seasons i would give 9 out of 10, unfortunately the show got a bit lost from there on as it slowly collapsed under its own weight while trying to become something legendary... the many story,lines got messier with new ones unnecessary added without any real need to do so and the intelligent script got quite a bit less intelligent while going along.spoilers: the whole season of arya going to the faceless god was a waste of time. no added value of going there, staying there and then on a blue monday suddenly she suddenly decided to go back for no real particular reason. a whole season filled with nothing and then after returning in just a few minutes she does something that could have filled a whole season... sighs... where's the logic there...furthermore, out of the blue the high sparrow pops up and takes over control reducing cercei to a pawn...?? who ever invented that totally illogical twist? as if the most mighty wealthy powerful house lannister would ever bend for a bunch of priests... let alone after cercei has got full power after her father died. sorry, that really makes no sense at all.just two examples of how messy the story-lines got and in my opinion there is by now a long list of inconsistencies so i would say the quality of script writing needs to go up a lot as soon as possible because game of thrones had a great start in the early years but now slowly is becoming an empty shell that still shines glamorous on the outside but gets more and more hollow on the inside.on a side note, samwell tarly is a nice character, but there really was no need to make this (again) another parallel story-line. you see, this is what i mean, an overdoses on story-lines and things just get messier by doing so.dragons -how spectacular they might be- can't cover up for the lack of an intelligent story. i would say get a focus, get a grip, hire some good writers and bring it back to the quality it had in the beginning.as it is right now: 8 out of 10 and only because i'm in a good mood and hope things will get better... ;-)rené"
2017-05-12,uriel_gutierrez_tapia,Everything that goes up must come down,9,"i'm making this review as a tv,show fan, despite i have read the books.i think this series started simply amazing. the first 3 seasons are proof of this. the first introduces us to the world of game of thrones, its characters and its exquisite political plot, so well elaborated that many are surprised that it is a work of fantasy. likewise, it broke the schemes of what we are used to seeing in terms of fantasy in an audiovisual medium, and the realism impregnated in the series, as well as the eloquent and well-placed cliff-hangers at the end of certain episodes made it a pleasant pleasure to see and enjoy. the second season, true, slower than the first, provides us with an even more elaborate political plot than the first, as well as the problems of a world at war. in addition, the characters show a great evolution and raise the main problems of the cusp of the series: the third season. this season shows us in addition to a clear evolution of the characters, the evolution of the series environment. it shows how the world around the characters has changed due to the actions and events occurred. it shows us that bad decisions have weight both in the real world and in a fantastic world, and as the world of game of thrones is so crude, the consequences will be harder and worse. in addition, it contains the most emblematic moments of the series and, the one that i think, the best chapter of the series: kissed by fire. the fourth season, although downgraded from the previous three, gave us still exciting and tense moments, brilliant moments of political plot and one of the best battles seen on television. however, it seems that not everything can be kept in such a good state. the fifth season is the point where the series radically twists its way. plots previously masterfully worked, begin to receive easy resolutions, consistency is lost in many of them and others are completely forgotten in the sense that they are not given the treatment they deserve and become simply stuffed. the characters are stagnant without the evolution shown in previous seasons and even begin to decline in quality, giving us some fantasy cliché characters. the quality of the episodes fell horribly, having a lousy pace and being the only salvageable of several ones only the end (a cliff-hanger). the scripts in addition to establishing a poor continuity, have deplorable lines that honestly, i can't imagine someone writing it and thinking it is good. the perfect series happened to be a series with chapters of filling, inconsistent plots and little interesting personages. while the sixth showed an improvement to all this, it still has clear issues of script and continuity, plus some totally ridiculous moments and wasted characters. game of thrones is an exceptional series, but these last seasons have made its valuation fall considerably. i really hope it gets better by next season. rating of each season:season 1: 8/10season 2: 8/10 season 3: 9/10 season 4: 7/10season 5: 5/10 season 6: 5/10season 7: 3/10series rating: 6.4/10."

2019-05-22,nickschweiss,A Song of Squandered Potential and Disappointment.,10,"game of thrones is renowned for its intricate character arcs, that start off already well,developed at the show's beginning. part of what made so many people so attached to their character of choice was the restraint writers had when it came to pacing even the most arbitrary plots in their hero or villain's tale. as the show progressed into it's later seasons, it became more and more apparent that this restraint was simply the work of martin himself that miraculously remained intact post-adaptation.it's hard to say when game of thrones became sour. many will argue that season 7 is where things got rough. i would argue that it took a heavy departure from well, thought-out writing during the dornne arc at the end of season 5 and beginning of season 6. arianne martell's unprovoked murder of the dornish prince was pure, unadulterated feminist fanservice. there is no universe in martin's seven kingdom's where she wouldn't have faced immense legal repercussions for her actions. however, this poor writing, which seemed to only exist to appease an agenda, is completely excusable in comparison to season 8.season 8 is horrendous. the show has spent several seasons creating a self-aware jaime who can no longer rationalize the actions of his sister and is on the road to redemption, yet we see this character arc completely squandered and disregarded. dany's transition from a stoic and righteous ruler to a psychopath corrupted by power happens in three minutes. jon's true identity as aegon targaryen has virtually no impact on his relationship with dany or any events that occur afterwards despite the show building up to this for its entire runtime. the night king's demise leave his true motivations and intentions a mystery. the heavy allegory of religious prophecy and the order of the god's is disregarded. arya's abilities to steal identities never reimerge to have a purposeful impact on the plot. bronn travels across a continent in 30 minutes to make death threats that contradict every aspect of his character. all of the dothraki, unsullied, and wildling armies are completely decimated by the scourge but reappear in the following episodes as if no battle had occurred at all. issues of how to sustain and feed the unexpectedly large infantry and dragons is addressed on screen but never acted upon. bran's mysterious and ungodly powerful worg abilities don't serve any purpose other than to allow him snide one-liners and make embarrassing remarks towards jaime and littlefinger. the iron fleet's deadly scorpion ballistae lay waste to rhagael, the dragon that the show made a point to keep alive from a near-death experience the previous episode, with a remarkable 3/3 shot accuracy, only to have no effect on drogon the following battle. d&d rationalized this as ""dany having forgotten about the iron fleet,"" despite her factoring for them during battle planning just an episode prior. bran willingly and eagerly takes the throne despite outright saying that he'd make a poor ruler as he's always stuck in the past. arya decides to sail west on house stark ships that don't exist because they live in the north. tyrion's cunning, and moral and ideological consistency don't prove to anyone that a house or name has no impact on your character, and he instead retains his position on a council for a ruler. jon exiles himself to a northern front that no longer needs to be defended for a murder that his sister and everyone else can and would pardon him for and that he believed to be the right thing to do.i give it a 7 because it is still worth a watch for the award-winning tv show it used to be, but i'd strongly suggest filling the ended with your own head canon and skipping the last season."
2019-04-22,nickyankees,B R I L L I A N T L Y D O N E IN EVERY ASPECT,10,no questions asked hands down i do not know another show that compares to this one. that may be a stretch saying that but there is no other shows that come to mind when trying to compare them not only in the genre of got but just how the show is made how it was casted the affects the budget.seeing tons and tons of videos on the cast and how well they work together and how close they have gotten in the last 10 years. it is just truly incredible with the final season almost half way over this makes me very sad. once it is all said and done and over this will be one of the shows i constantly re watch it!
2020-02-20,benji-1031,Our Disappointment Will Never Die,10,when the ending is so awful that it ruins the entire journey.. nine months later and that garbage ending is still trash. somehow dan and dave managed to ruin the arc of every main character in got in s8. the main theme of got was misogyny. it's disgusting.
2019-05-09,benwilliamson-79927,Truly Phenomenal,1,"i didn't trust my father's taste in television until he convinced me to watch breaking bad and i fell in love with it, thinking there could never be a better show. then i agreed to watch game of thrones, expecting to hate it as i'm not a fan of sci,fi, or dragons, or anything else i knew the show for. but i watched it, and had soon completely forgotten the name walter white. game of thrones is widely regarded as the greatest tv show of all time, and for good reason. the writing is phenomenal, the editing is superb, and the acting is immense. admittedly, the show is not as good in season 8 as it was in seasons 1-6/7, but i still believe that season 8 is better than almost every other tv show ever made. season 8 gets a 9/10 but every other season gets a 10/10, without question.one has to have a little sympathy for the creators, db weiss and david benioff, as the pressure of concluding the greatest tv series in history is indescribable. however, the latest season has a few minor plot holes, as well as some of the worst battle tactics i've ever seen! i'm disappointed with season 8, but i can't deny that every episode has had me on the edge of my seat and counting down the days until next sunday, which is exactly what any good show should do. any ratings below 7 or 8 are from people who are simply frustrated that their theories are not playing out as they wanted. no ending for a show of this size would have pleased everyone, any despite some inconsistencies, i think david and dan have done a, mostly, very good job."
2019-05-09,benwilliamson-79927,PLEASE READ!!!! (it's important) and click helpful so more see it...,10,"please do not review this show on the last season. if you want to review season 8, review it on the season 8 page. this page is meant for reviewing got as a whole, not on its last season. the vast majority still consider got to be the greatest show of all time, and i agree."
2021-09-13,siert92,The best TV show that never was,10,"game of thrones starts out as an underrated tv show about wars, a looming sense of doom all intertwined with political plottwists that you do not see coming.this show started off pretty unknown but quickly grew out to become a global phenomenon with a great cast, budget and story based on the books of george r. r. martin.when season 5 ended it was already known that george's disastrous writing pace was not enough to catch up with the show. season 6 covered some new ground that the books hadn't touched on yet, and without a good story to fall back on the writers had to fill in the gaps. and it showed. season 6 nontheless is generally considered to be the last decent season of game of thrones.if you, unlike millions of others, are able to live with an unresolved story... stop there.the whole world was wondering who 'dan & dave' (the producers) would kill off next. little did we know they killed off the show and the fanbase with it. somewhere during season 6 they came up with the bright idea of starting to personally get involved with the script and the show that was already struggling to keep up expectations after losing the source material died right there and then.the show was well known for its clever twists and turns, but season 7 & 8 had no twists nor anything clever. mistakes were made, and they're called dan and dave."
2019-06-28,awladhossain-58789,Bran does not deserve to be the king.,10,"an outstanding tv series, no doubt about it. from season 1 to the 4th episode of the last season, every single viewers enjoyed until the final drama came. i still don't find a conclusion for daenerys targaryens rage at the very last moment. she was shown as a kind and forgiving character unlike her father. she was fond of having a real queen's place in general people's heart, then the execution of missandei completely flipped her character! she could have avenged her death by punishing cersei and her bodyguard 'the mountain', but what daenerys did was a completely different from her character throughout the entire season. and then what about bran! he became a three,eyed-raven or was able to see the past and present or whatever, these types of characters can become the right of o good king, but, how could we let him become a king? a good king is a conqueror. he not only conquers lands, but also people. jon snow fought for the wildlings by risking his own life, even when his fellowmen did not want him to. he did what his heart told him to do, for the sake of humanity, but, he was rewarded by his old job 'night's watch'!
i still don't have any idea why they thought about the finishing. disappointing."
2019-05-16,meeraxvv,got,2,"one of the best shows i have ever watched great actors and actresses
great crew
great directing
can't wait for the season finale"
2020-07-26,agisaak,Perfection Denied,7,"i've noticed a lot of reviews lately which have given this series very low ratings based entirely on the final season. my rating of 8/10 is based on the series as a whole. had my rating being based on seasons 1,6, i would have assigned this a 10/10. i should note that i have never before given anything a 10/10. i have given a rating of 9/10 only once (for del toro's _el laberinto del fauno_).while game of thrones garnered significant controversy during its run, particularly for it sexual and violent content, and while no doubt there are many for whom this series would be unappealling simply because they don't appreciate the genre, i think that even among those who disliked the show it would be difficult to dispute how strongly the show excelled in the following areas:first, the story itself is sufficiently interesting and rich that it is difficult to imagine anyone following this series for more than a few episodes not becoming thoroughly immersed in its compelling characters, its detailed storyline, and the incredibly well-developed fictional world which it creates. we also have the rather novel approach to storytelling in which many of the most significant aspects of the plot occur *before* the story even begins.second, the casting is utterly phenomenal. i am hard-pressed to identify a single other film or television series in which the ratio of extraordinary performances to the size of the cast as a whole even approaches this; this is an even greater accomplishment when one considers the sheer size of the cast.because of the size of the cast, i won't comment on most of the performances. i will, however, briefly comment on one particular fact which illustrates the strength of their casting department, and that is their success with casting child actors who, for obvious reasons, have less experience and shorter résumés than most, making casting more difficult. yet their success rate was phenomenal.the younger stark childen (maise williams, sophie turner, isaac hempstead wright, art parkinson) are obvious examples who have been deservedly praised for their performances, but several more minor characters deserve mention. what was arguably the most disturbing scene in the entire series would have been far less compelling were it not for kerry ingram's performance as princess shireen. and it is hard to imagine the second-most disturbing scene, of robin arryn making grand proclamations of making people fly interspersed with suckling on his mother's teat, without lino facioli. and, of course, bella ramsey's performance as lyanna mormant is simply brilliant.third, this series presents some of the most compelling character development arcs that i can recall in television. both jaime (nikolaj coster-waldau) and sansa (sophie turner) have received a great deal of attention here (though season eight sort of destroyed the jaime-arc), but also worth mentioning here is rory mccann's performance as the hound.fourth, both the cinematography and ramin djawadi's scoring are absolutely beautiful and combine perfectly with all of the above to create what could have been a near-perfect series were it not for a somewhat disappointing 7th season and an absolutely dismal 8th season?so what exactly went wrong?many other reviews seem to think that things went south after the show passed george r.r. martin's source material at which point the writing started to fall apart. i don't believe this. the showrunner's had access to a detailed outline of where the story was going, and even before they caught up the books, they were never slavishly following the books.it seems to me that something external happened which essentially forced them to finish up the series in far fewer episodes than had originally been intended. hence, while we saw compelling character development in previous seasons, we see daenerys transform into the mad queen over the course of a single episode (sure, there had been much foreshadowing, but one episode?). we see entire, rather significant, storylines suddenly dropping off the face of westeros altogether (e.g. following the demise of the night king we basically forget that the white walkers and the army of the dead even existed). and we see a show that gained much of it's draw from its 'slow-burn' pacing suddenly trying to wrap things up as if it were some sort of action show.it's possible that hbo put their foot down and said ""you get six more episode"", but that seems rather unlikely. sure, the show was expensive, but i have a hard time believing that they were losing money on it.that leaves some sort of logistical issue. possibly they were unable to renew access to critical filming locations and didn't have the budget to create new sets elsewhere.alternately, there may have been issues with cast members who were unwilling or unable to commit to more than some small number of additional episodes. while a few roles had been recast over the course of the series, these were either relatively minor roles (e.g. princess myrcella), characters recast shortly after their introduction (daario naharis), or characters who had few lines and nearly always wore helmets with faceplates (the mountain). but recasting any of the major characters this late in the game would simply not have been feasible).another possibility was that the cast were simply unavailable at the same times. in previous seasons, characters had been scattered across different locales on two continents. now they were suddenly all appearing on screen together. combine that with the fact that many of the actors who had once been unknown or little known were now in high demand thanks to the success of got, and you end up with a logistical nightmare.i just hope that someone with some behind-the-scenes knowledge will eventually come forward with the story."

2017-04-07,khawlama,wow,10,"this show got me sitting for a whole day on a chair my pc before me without taking my eyes off of the screen until i finished the 6 seasons in just a week.i enjoyed it,i enjoyed every episode,every season,every scene,every part of it. okay now i gotta mention the one thing that got me in awe,and it was the acting,the great performance and the getting fully into the character. after that,comes the scenario which is based on the books written by george r.r martin and i haven't read them but i bet they were real page turners. the scenario couldn't be better, the dialogues mixed with a little bit of drama and theater ,which made it look perfect. in a brief conclusion,it is the best show i've ever watched until now. so for those out there who didn't have the chance to watch it,just get it done already,i promise you won't regret. ps:if you are a student and you're willing on going for it,just make sure you don't have any exams coming for a week or so.just saying...."
2017-04-30,calexander-62759,It takes time to release new chapters.,10,"great series, but the delay to launch new chapters erases the brilliance of the plot. the public waits more than a year to continue following the story and this delay makes it forgotten even the last chapter seen. there are people who by this have already given up on keeping up. those responsible should have more respect with the public and repair this failure!"

2019-05-25,nickrider-08833,Great show ruined by a lazy rushed shock ending,10,"no spoilers.i read the books when they first came out and watched the show from the start. the first three seasons based off the books are a masterpiece. sadly because the books weren't finished the show takes a radical direction from then on with a lot less character development and more action and cgi. seasons 4 and 5 still had many pointers from the author george rr martin, so they are okay but not as good as the first three. at seasons 6 and 7 plot holes start to appear and characters teleport around the world wherever the script needs them, doing uncharacteristic things or having their story arc end with a fizzle. character development has completely ended and the show priority is action and cgi above everything.season 8 the final season could be from a completely different show. the developed characters change in intelligence and personality. the script changes established sub plots and character arcs because as the script writers stated on record, ""they wanted to shock the audience and do something completely different.""well recording over the end of a film with a comedy sketch like this is a vhs video tape is shocking and completely unexpected, but not for good reasons!the final season is so alien to the whole world design and established story arc that it really doesn't fit in with anything in previous seasons. it's shallow, rushed, badly written and destroys almost a decade of good television just for shock value. it ruins any replay value in the whole series that there just isn't any point in watching it again. there are many subplots that lead to dead ends, unanswered questions, character changes that don't match the characters natural progression in the past 7 seasons and then there are the sloppy edits and continuity errors like plastic water bottles on set or a starbucks coffee cup at a medieval feast in plain sight. battles that make no sense, tactics that don't work, plot armour and fan fiction, armies that die to a last in a desperate stand of a few dozen, only to respawn like new in the very next episode. weapons that magically work or don't work depending on the new plot the useless script writers come up with next. wounds that a fatal suddenly becoming a but a scratch and characters gaining superpowers like flight, invisibility and invulnerability. a fantasy show that was great because it prided itself on not doing fantasy tropes suddenly does every fantasy trope in the book. everything about this final season is rushed and sloppy and a mess. you would be better off pretending season 8 didn't exist. it will ruin everything you have watched up to that point. i can't even begin to cover all the problems with each episode. there are plenty of youtube channels that go into detail with all the discrepancies and problems of each episode. seasons 6 and 7 aren't great but are still watchable. but season 8 is not even watchable. do yourself a favour and don't watch it. you will find only disappointment and frustration.if the show ended at season 3 it would be a 10/10. if it ended at season 5 it would be an 8/10, at season 7 it would be a 6.9/10 but with season 8 it's about a 3/10 and those three points are for the acting and set design. the story is destroyed and the show is no longer worth watching on repeat. i'm so disappointed with that final season. they delayed the release for two years and yet didn't spend ten minutes of those two years editing and cleaning it up the errors and rushed plots to even resemble some form of quality. they treated it like printing money from a brand name while putting minimal effort in."

2019-05-06,aliwazid-80790,Superb series.,10,i never watched such a superb series .. every thing is interconnected superbly. incredible
2018-06-25,lordstarkenberg,An excellent fantasy series!,10,"finally, a fantasy series comes out of the obscure and into the mainstream. this is hands down one of the best produced shows on the air. it doesn't quite follow the books, as the many storylines and characters add a complexity that the average tv viewer would have trouble keeping up with; however, it does a great job with set dressing, costumes, and the actors are on point."
2019-05-20,ahmadaltoom-61797,The best tv show ever,1,don't take a look on s8 but look at the other seasons 👌🏼
2019-06-03,manshedmark,BEST SHOW EVER,9,just amazing. only reason for you not to watch it is because it will simply set your bar to high and make you not appreciate other shows as much.
2019-05-20,rashed-02920,the best ever !,10,best show everi don't know why people think it's awful because just the final season!
2019-05-20,aparpit,best series ever,10,"i loved this show till season 7, but it was bit fast in season 8. there should be more of it. waiting for sequel/prequel..👍🔥🔥❄"
2011-07-30,silmaril12,Great epic fantasy finally comes to television,10,"although there have been a few tweaks here and there from the first book in the series, everything about the first series of ""game of thrones"" lived up to my expectations and exceeded it. that's what great tv is about. the writers, cast, directors and everyone else have done a superb job with the source material. my only complaint is the second series is also to be called ""game of thrones"". 'a clash of kings' needs to be its subtitle or, the series should've been titled after the full name of the novel series 'a song of ice and fire' and then with the subtitles of the different novels beneath. now, the torture of waiting until april 2012 begins. i have high expectations for series two including the epic skirmish the battle of blackwater bay. that should be a thrill though due to budgetary reasons they may have to whittle it down. let the ""clash"" begin."
2019-05-11,chinnujyotirmay-33157,Fantastic TV show,10,a fantastic show a must for fictional fans also the show is based on george rr martin's books so naturally it would be a fantastic show
2018-11-29,rileyjackspicer,hello listen to this,8,"so to be without spoilers, and also because i'm too stoned at the moment, this won't be too detailed. got is fully thrown one of the best tv series you will watch in your life. phenomenal acting, awesome character storyline's, and thrilling scenes that keep you on edge and waiting for the next episode. 10/10 would recommend, and a 10 is something i really refrain from giving anything, so that a 10 like got can be recognised when i rate it a 10. watch it past the long first 2 episodes, and you will have 7 seasons so far of the best show of your life, from me."
2021-05-09,writebgk,THE best TV series for me,6,"game of thrones is one of those tv shows that set the bar so high that you will keep looking for similar high in other tv shows that follow only to get disappointed again and again and again. yes, i have not come across a single show that is even close to the thrill that game of thrones gave me when i watched it. this is despite the season 8 which is generally criticized. yeah season 8 could have been better but that won't change the fact that this is still one of the greatest shows produced.i always wondered what is so special about got. almost everything is perfect about it be it casting, the character development, visuals, dialogues, music, production values but there are three highlights for me.1) the background score. there is no other movie or tv show that had a background score like this one. not anything even close.2) tyrion in first four seaons.3) jon snow in later seasons. this is one of the best heroic characters i have ever seen or read. expected more from him in last season but still remains my favourite character."
2019-05-15,alamrys,The greatest in the history of television,9,one of the best shows i've seen. and i think no other series will compete with him.

2019-05-19,ecryosin,10/10,9,people wanted it to end like how they theorized it. it didn't. thank the gods for that.
2019-05-20,aprilis-91415,Masterpiece show with a big slap in the face as ending,10,"great show as to how true it stays to reality and says no to cheesy hollywood plots. every character has his or her own arc and a unique motive to his or her actions, unlike any other show. when you liked all of these so much, the final season tells you nah this is not true at all, all shows need to be hollywooded and brought down to a few heroes' moral characters and their own romantic relationships to save the world. don't watch the final season, enjoy the first 4 mainly, maybe 5 and 6, probably not 7, definitively not the last. think of it as an open ended show, it'll serve you much better"
2021-07-15,dieuleveutkembo,My Second Favorite Tv Show After Lost,5,"got, lost, and dexter are my top three shows of all time. and there is a reason for that. i simply could not stop watching them once i started. i had to binge the entire thing at once. i consumed each and everyone of these shows in a matter of weeks, if not days simply because i loved them too much. each are well acted, and their stories are captivating. the character development in each is phenomenal. you really root for the characters, and you feel attached to them. i know many people have an issue with the ending of each of these shows i mentioned above, but as far as got is concerned, i could not simply start hating because the last season, especially episode 3, was a let down. i had to remind myself that i had a great time going through a great journey for 7 seasons. i simply couldnt hate the entire show because they managed to ruined a couple of episodes. i am more of a journey guy than a destination guy so i still love the show. in fact, i watched it twice so far, and enjoyed it thorouly each of those times. do yourself a favor, and go watch got."

2019-05-20,kashifmehmood-27311,Season 8 episode 6,9,episode is not as good as expected. this was the last episode of the season. users expected this episode to be epic. ending is senseless and full of suspense. no body knows where arya is going. why dragon took dynaras and where it gone.
2019-05-16,christiane-93142,Final season,8,this final season has been absolute trash and is unfair to fans who have spent money and been following the show from the beginning. we are owed more than this. rushed with poor writing.

2019-05-22,ahmed_b-02551,Best TV show ever,10,it is unpredictable like the normal life that's why it's great.
2019-05-16,mazyonat_uae,Best show ever,8,"i have seen all of tv show. but i have never loved a tv show like this. it's very well written, the event that happened it's a build up of many events that happened in previous seasons. nothing just happens out of nowhere or without any logic and that what makes the show the greatest. the conversation and the writing is just perfection. the characters development in the show is geniusi can't really even mention any negativity. cuz if there was any bad side im sure that the positive thing are far more than the bad things to even be mentioned."
2019-05-07,scarletthart-96290,Incredible and season 8 wasn't that bad,7,"i truly believe that game of thrones is the best show in terms of quality and season 8 even though the plot was rushed was still a good end to the series. i understand that people are annoyed at dan and david and i get that but imagine the burden of having game of thrones on your shoulders. i think season 8 would go from a 8.5 in my opinion to a 10 if season 7 and 8 were both 10 episodes long like the rest. dany's arch wouldn't have felt so rushed and the night kings defeat so anti climactic.although i think people missed the point that game of thrones is more about human conflict than magical conflict hence jon snow being the prince who was promised killing dany the darkness he had to defeat. i think that the argument that many things didn't lead anywhere is a bit shallow as many things in the previous seasons didn't lead anywhere. what was the point of the battle of the five kings? none of them are king now, they are all dead. the point was people die, people fail. not everything needs to have a purpose.there are many plot holes in the previous seasons, you just didn't notice because you weren't looking for things to hate. for example how did brienne know were sansa was in season 6 episode 1 just in the nick of time. how convenient? how did the gold melt so quickly to be poured on viserys head? why does the white walker in season two just ride past samwell tarly? i don't know and i don't really care.overall the final season was still better in all respects than most other shows could only dream of. i disagree with everyone saying that it was the worst thing ever and they couldn't be more disappointed. game of thrones will go down in history as the best tv has to offer and once the rash animosity dies down, season 8 will be regarded as a decent ending to an amazing series! seasons 1,7 - 10/10
season 8 - 8.5/10"
2019-05-16,fassooly-40755,it's a great episode,10,"it was a wonderful episode i do not know why i did not like you i just want to say production, acting and directing are all fantastic so this episode deserves a high rating"
2019-05-16,fassooly-40755,it's a great show,10,"the complete show is perfect acting and directing, photography, music, music is very awesome and the story is the best story i have seen in my life everything is very perfect"
2019-04-30,jimboy-87728,Season 8 Episode 3,1,"1. legend of the promised prince / first warrior / azor ahai has been canceled.2. the whole chapter about stannis and melissandre is meaningless3. the various actions of jon as lord commander of the night watch (rescue of the wildlings) and the desperate attempt to explain to others that the true war is in the north. everything meaningless.4. the background story of the night king was screwed up. he is abused by the children of the forest as a weapon and became independent. why? can he still think and feel? if so, what exactly is his motive? how could he actually survive the first long night? will he revived all 8,000 years? so many unsolved questions.5. for what all the effort? why did jon risk his life when it only needs a dagger to win?"
2019-05-09,harlequin_07,A hard goodbye to Game of Thrones,9,"i remember running home from school to watch the first season of got, i remember running home from college to watch got, i remember driving home from my apprenticeship to watch got, i remember driving home this year at the age of 25 to watch got and i can honestly say it's been heart breaking after all this time that i can no longer defend the writing of got. after watching episodes like hardhome, the rains of castamere, blackwater and the door how can i continue watching in such disappointment with season 8? for so long game of thrones was the epitome of television, it attracted so many diverse people with its dialogue, action scenes and lore/background info. i've been in denial for awhile about the decline of got, i believe it was s5 where it started but it wasn't that noticeable, it got worse during s6 and s7 but there was always epic episodes at the end of the season that brought it back up to scratch. i can honestly say i've been disappointed with every damn episode in s8, so disappointed in fact that i don't think i will be watching the remaining 2 episodes, i think i will just finish the story with the disappointment that the nk's death was and go back to watching seasons 1,4 for the nostalgia and the epicness that rivaled lotr. will i watch the spin offs? to early to tell, i won't get my hopes up and therefore won't be as disappointed but i must say after so many years of got being a part of my life, i am truly devastated the way it has finished."

2019-11-16,feliciastrand-71308,The last session sucks.,9,i loved game of thrones. even though it had it's flaws towards the end. but the last season was so genuinely bad that i kinda regret ever watching it in the first place.
2019-05-20,bobuskobus,It is better not to start,9,"4 amazing seasons, 2 more very decent seasons another ok and a disaster at the end.if you'll start watching, you'll think that you finally found intelligent, complex, unexpected, well budgeted series. it will get better and better. but in the end all of it will end with a super,hero movie level of writing, all the complexity will be gone, heavy plot armor, and the entire plot will feel like an excuse to move from one magnificent shot to another without any logic between them.first time in my life i was so invested in a tv series. and this season 8 was a great slap of disappointment to my face."

2019-05-13,archbandar,"Good, then great ! Then BAD",10,"you watch the series gets better and better the characters too, but then they play the characters in a non logical way, the last season is a waste of time , the writers force what they want on the watcher , they choose who you hate and love, it wasn't like that on the beginning, that is something that the ppl most loved about the show, but no they want to ruin their legacy."

2019-05-22,mornidorni,The real GoT ended after season 6 for me,10,"because it was honestly the best show ,exciting/thrilling and just awesome. george martin is a genius, i love the writing, the books are amazing, but i prefer tv. i would give the show a 10 if it wasn't for the finale season that for me are the most important thing, and this finale was worse than the series dexters ending... you ruined it d&d."
2019-05-20,mattchipdey,My heart is broken,9,"this is without a doubt the greatest tv show of all time...if you stop watching after s8e3. i can't even begin to imagine what was going on in the writers head that they managed to ruin an entire series in a mere 3 episodes. they completely threw out 7 amazing seasons of character development and storylines and left us with a half,assed mess. the finale is an embarrassment to the show and i urge you to save yourself the misery and pretend the last 3 episodes don't exist."
2019-05-21,qattannadine,Their watch has ended,6,the best tv show in history even if the last season was ruined this show will forever be in my heart.
2019-05-30,thelatestdionne,"Fantastic, until the final season",10,"this show started slow, but it grew on you. throughout the series you get invested in the story, and have some explosive (literally) moments that are thrilling! these big moments were unexpected so it was a treat every time they occurred. as the show headed towards season 7, you can tell the directing got a tad lazy, but it was still fun to watch. then season 8 happened. cinematography? great. story? meh. there are some moments that have you confused. for example: dany forgot about euron's fleet? grey worm teleports to where dany is? the castle falls on jamie and cersei, which kills them, yet tyrion can walk to their bodies? the lighting of the long night? ultimately, game of thrones is still a fantastic show. it is a shame that the final season only had six episodes, and was rushed."
2021-02-19,badmrpotatohead,Don't waste your time,10,this went from being the best show ever to one of the worst. the last two season burn the entire series down. the terrible writers and show runners rubbed out the final season on your face and didn't even toss you a towel to clean yourself up.
2019-06-16,anpujnairs,Really good in the first 7 seasons,9,the best fantasy tv series in the world. the ending may disappoint you because it seems rushed. one character changes so much in an instant that it doesn't make sense. but the previous seasons were just lit. the pace was good. acting was top notch.
2019-05-14,adragon82,Greatest show with worst last season in living memory.,6,"i cannot express how great this show was in its first 6 seasons. it was, the single best fantasy based show in history and also one of the best written non fantasy shows in history...then, then the source ran dry. with having caught up to the novels the shows ""writers"" had to go to martin for assistance with where the story was going to go.with season 7, martin was able to give them just enough information from what he has to give them a decent amount to write with. with season 8, all martin had to give them was the basics of what he was going to do and oh my god have these writers shown that they are terrible on their own.the flaws in season 8 is so glaring, and stand out in ways that is at times gobsmacking.we know from season 2 that harrinhall was ""melted"" by dragonfire, and told, specifically that is exactly what happens to stone, when a dragon breathes its fire and it hits it...well, screw that says the writers of season 8. now, dragonfire causes stone to explode like it was hit with a missile!this, along with great twists like the queen of dragons just up and ""forgetting"" that her enemy has a fleet of ships even though she had just be told about them, and that they destroyed her own fleet and killed several of her key allies just months before that so they could kill one of her dragons, from impossible angles.anyway, i should give the writers some credit in that i have never seen anything remotely like i am seeing right now, with anything else...that almost every single person that i know that loved this show with a passion are now debating on not even watching the finale episode or not.talk about wrecking a legacy."

2019-08-11,mustafa-25645,Would of been the greatest series of all time if it wasn't for the last few episodes.,5,"amazing series but the story went downhill in he last few episodes and it has broken a lot of hearts. why rush an ending with absolutely no empathy for the loyal audience which have been religiously following this series since the beginning. i think george rr martin will be disgusted and he will be laughing when he writes the final book. thank you for some amazing tv but no thank you for breaking my heart more then when my ex girlfriend left me, changed her number and flew back to la."
2020-04-30,chethanrizzy,Season 8 disappointing!!,10,"season 8 could have been done better far from that it is something like the plot of 8th season could be done better

2012-03-21,andrew_in_nh,An unexpected masterpiece,10,"despite being acquainted with martin, and multiple recommendations of the books by friends of good taste, i have never read the series. i saw trailers for the hbo series, and they looked lovely, but my wife and i never quite found the time to try it.a couple of days ago my wife wasn't feeling well, and we wanted to watch something...and a teaser about the second season caught our eyes. we both admitted to curiosity, so we started the first episode.the next day we finished the last of the ten episodes making up the first season. we never do this kind of viewing marathon, but game of thrones grabbed us completely.the acting varies, sometimes by intent and sometimes by the capacity of the actors, but the overall quality is far above average for tv drama. the cinematography is superb. there are visual elements from the season that i'm still processing two days after the marathon. (the last television i saw that had this combination of beauty and quality was downton abbey, and i never would have thought to link the two until this moment.) best of all? there is a strong story, with multiple lines, and i have to think about and figure out the ways in which it works. nothing is handed to me, and i often have no idea what will happen next. i have a chance to discover this world, and figure out parts, at least, of how it works.i have been delighted by the first season, and now am eagerly waiting until the second season begins. i have a nasty feeling that i have the first book in the series lurking in my bedroom, and i don't know whether i can resist the urge to begin reading...."

2021-03-08,dustycaldwell,The show is good whether you like s8 or not,2,"i have enjoyed this show a lot. i like all of the seasons (even season 8) although i hated the series finale, i enjoyed the rest of season 8, and i'd give it a positive review. it is the weakest of the others seasons though. this show is a 10/10 don't let the finale make you drag it down"
2020-09-15,paulsgl,The best series I've ever seen,10,"game of thrones is one of the best series i've ever seen. season 8 may be disappointing, but since the seasons blew me away, you can take it. after i finished watching the series, i watched it again. and it's just fun to discuss game of thrones with friends and get 10/10 points for that."
2011-06-29,goxgox,One of the best fantasy series,10,"first i must warn you i'm a book,fan and could be biased in this review.since i've read books first, i've eagerly awaited this show and followed it from the start of the production, with inside views, teasers and trailers and all i can say it's - great. although i was skeptical ahead of the first season, my fears were without reason, hbo did great job with it, and all i can hope for is that they'll continue doing it in next season(s).one thing has to be pointed out, story is very complex, with a lot of details, something you cannot transfer to the screen easily. series lack certain information and it'll be obvious even to common viewer that it's only the tip of the ice berg, and hopefully he/she will get interested in a books. that's a plus, as you can only enrich your viewing experience by reading the books (and books have re-read value as well, just then you get all the smaller hints author has weaved in the story). so, in that matter, series cannot entirely reflect the books, but it's one of the best adaptations i've ever seen.second, cast has been amazingly done, from young and perspective maisie williams who is a total discovery to me, to already proved sean bean or peter dinklage. there're only few roles in which i would cast different actors, and neither of it is main character. jerome flynn (bronn) has made his character even better (or should i say ""more notable"") then in the books, totally my vision of it.as authors of the series had great story to tell us, cast has been magnificent as well and costumes and cgi effects were fine at least, i cannot find a reason to give smaller mark here. first season (book) was just introduction to the world of westeros and it's people and i can only hope series will keep it's quality in the future. with that said, i'll point out few things i didn't liked. first, and the biggest, is absolute absence of battles. there were two important ones in first season and we haven't seen anything of it. not that it bothers me at current stage, but later on battles will be integral part of the storyline and hbo won't be able to avoid it. i know it's to lower the cost, but that would reduce the quality and make harm to the series in my opinion. second is small number of episodes, so most of the scenes are hasted. that's especially obvious in ""important"" scenes which should be given more screen time, when there's no time at all. i'm well aware it's budget problem, and if there's place for improvement, then that's budget. raise it and series will get even better. third, and last, is absence of flashbacks to the period of time before robert ruled. that period is important and i thought it'll get some time, but they've decided to totally remove it from first season, hopefully in second season it'll change and we'll get to see how house targaryen got to rule, and some lyanna stark flashbacks too.with more episodes series could be even more improved, adding more depth to story and characters, but even if it keeps it's current level it's already my personal favorite fantasy series out there. if you want to get more insight to the westeros world you'll need to read the books, but even without it you get the picture and can enjoy the best and most accurate book adaption there is."
2020-04-20,bgroves-51481,Heartbroken,10,"heartbroken is the only way you can describe this show. there are so many reasons to love got. the beautiful directing, the amazing chemistry between the cast, the witticisms, the love and hate you have for so many of the characters.for anyone wanting to try it be warned, there are lots of family names being thrown around, people discussing things and you'll have no idea what's going on. don't worry, we was all in that boat and you slowly begin to unwind the genius of the show and episode after episode and season after season everything starts to come together. however, roll on season 7.personally, i enjoyed season 7. it was action packed but it was certainly rushed and it was certainly noticeable. in the earlier seasons a character may be travelling somewhere and may take them a few episodes or half a season to arrive at the destination. in season 7 their weary journey, which would have taken days, now takes minutes and they jump all over westeros even if they are at the very south, then get to beyond the wall (very north) within minutes. it's nitpicking but it was a massive difference to what the fans had been used to. a good season overall, with some shocking moments. but then comes seasons 8.a complete train wreck. the writers had been approached to write other big projects and their focus was completely lost. characters were doing things that were out of character. fans came up with better plots and direction for their favourites to go in, some things that were obvious when thought about, but not obvious to the men who had been writing it for years.in all honesty, got is a slow and painful journey. it's full of joy, sadness, laughter, darkness, death, pain, sex, love and so much hate. omg there are so many people you will hate. but you love to hate them and you can gather with other fans and they will tell you they hate them as well. you will laugh together at how much you hate these people and mourn together about the ones you loved.watch it, and just accept that it won't end how you want it to. make up your own ending or what for the author to finish the last book and read the real ending."
2020-04-27,gamestvbobbi,Epic storyline,10,"the story is just amazing, there are a lot of characters, different groups and different opinions.the first 4/5 seasons were beautiful to watch and following the characters through their journeys through westeros (and essos) until they all met eventually in the last season(s). from season 5/6 it got a bit worse but it was still watchable, interesting and fun.
seasons 7 and 8. it's just painful to watch this huge potential slowly but surely being wasted.
season 8 in particular, the conversations got shorter and meaningless.the dramatic turn at the end was surprising and i personally was sad, but it was quite exciting.
the ending then destroyed everything.in my opinion it was a good show but the end wasn't as great as you'd hoped it would've been."
2020-05-09,tilak-22911,Best of all time and winter is coming,1,"game of thrones finally finished, the last episode aptly titled the long night and it was a terrible ending, disappointing for fans, causing a collective cringe around the globe.best of all time and winter is coming."
2020-07-28,romanseight,Amazing!,9,"this show has it all! the scenery, acting, and over all production, is perfect! i am so sad to see it end. it is a masterpiece that i will likely watch over and over again!"
2020-05-24,nansheng-50708,amazing in terms of color and technology,9,"the tv series is amazing in terms of color and technology. of course, these are just superficial advantages. the core of this tv play is soul shaking, and it makes people ponder the eternal issues of human nature and rights."
2020-05-22,thomasstacey-76176,Vintage television,10,"an all time classic tv show , with a rather weak ending (hence the star deduction). don't let that put you off too much though - the journey is more important then the destination, and this one is well worth your time."
2020-06-29,ravichilka,ITS LIKE U RAISE BABY AND IT TURNS OUT TO BECOME THE BRIGHTEST AND THEN YOU MURDER IT WITH YOUR HANDS,10,"if you are looking for periodic fantasy with epic goosebumps scenes then this is it. game of thrones is well planned, brilliantly executed and also well recevied by the audience as it turns out to be the most watch television series in history.
the strength of this series is unpredictiveness with excellent character development.
also the background score is a reason for its success.strength, strong acting, bgm, camerawork, screenplay, dailogues, epic.flaw- ***********s08 e05**************"
2020-06-26,moreirastalin,if not for the last season it was one of the best series I've seen,3,i must confess that i'm such a fan of this series that i'd better forget about the last season and i'll keep how fantastic it was
2020-06-26,msadeghhaji,TERRIBLE FINAL SEASAON,1,"don,t waste you time watching this masterpiece being ruined. :((( this film could be the goat :( they ruined it all. incompetent producers destroyed the masterpiece story in final seasons . i wish they remake last two seasons were the problem started ! so sad experience :( waste of lots of money and energy and fans. even a kid would have made better better ending :( just a random fan could have make a better final season with that budget and that rich potential :( so sad"
2020-06-07,laneywozere,Great show,1,"was up there with the best, all the actor's and actresses did a brillant job with the accents, but the last series felt rushed, so disappointing, would of loved to see everyone die and the white walkers win"
2020-07-21,mustafaerdemme,Ah the last season...,10,"it actually began with the season 6. i mean the corruption of the show. i dont know what changed but the story and the story,telling started shifting. my anger is not for the ending of the story (even though it was very disapponting) it is for the story-telling. but for the sake of all the good time and excitement the show gave me (that is befor seasons 7 and 8) i think the series still deserve 6 stars."
2020-08-11,vascodcc,It's just A-M-A-Z-I-N-G...,7,"...well, until you watch the last season. my advice for the producers is to forget the last season and do a brand new one! without rush! just got style!!"
2020-08-02,ccp-79158,My favorite show of all time,10,"i don't care if season 8 was completely underwhelming, i love got. when you ask me about it, i only consider seasons 1,7 as being part of the actual show, the last season is in my mind not game of thrones.no other tv show has hooked me so much. no other show has kept me up to 4:00 a.m. because i just couldn't stop myself. many will say breaking bad is superior. i admit breaking bad was perfect, but for me game of thrones was just something else. the characters were brilliant, the story lines were mesmerizing, the world was varied and fascinating and the lore was deep. season 8 was such a shame, although this is my personal favorite, it prevented got from attaining divinity in the eyes of others."
2020-11-20,kishu-38196,GOAT,7,bit disappointed from the last season but surely won't cut a star because of that..apart from that i don't have words to describe how brilliant it was
2020-09-03,azamsahito,Goat,10,greatest of all times.. my all time favorite series
2020-12-15,sajaljain-59093,Mesmerizing,10,"each individual character in this show makes this show worth watching. the way each character builds up leaves one in awe. no scene is this show is for just for the sake of it. the story is built in a very logical fashion. everything is very related to what has happened in the past. the story becomes better as the seasons progress. the unpredictable assassinations and shifts in the balance of power in the show makes it very unique and memorable. the last season of the series is not up to the mark. earlier seasons were adopted from the books of george r r martin. since the books hadn't came out, the creators of the show made complete fool of themselves in the last season. that's why i haven't given it 10 stars."
2020-09-30,epz-12221,Awesome from Season1 to Season 7! Season 8 Disappointing!,3,the start of the series was great! in the middle some time it got a little exausting but was still very interesting and entertaining. the ending was disappointing in my opinion....
2021-08-16,asterroyalford,A worth watching show.,9,this would be best shows if the season would become good.
2020-11-23,adwaithg-08388,An Masterpiece Item,9,"a really fantastic maked series the making and vfx was such good but the last season spoiled it and the story line changed then it became average but the fight sequences,actong,making all these quiete lit🔥 my 2nd favorite series"
2020-12-03,sukinmana,Golden Age of TV,6,"once upon a time, got among other shows were driving people crazy for more, tv was at its height, now without got in the world there is a whole, a vast whole waiting to be filled. shame it had to end, it could have easily gone on for more seasons. still i would recommend this to anyone, just maybe skip the last season lol."
2020-12-22,gameryasin,Dont miss it,10,the series is very good be sure to watch it and dont miss it
2020-12-28,reemnajjar-07609,Epic,9,"just epic .. one of the greatest shows ever ..magic, war, love, conspiracy, courage and much more"
2021-05-21,barisora,"Good story,bad ending.",6,"this serie has a great story,you can feel yourself in the seven kingdoms,you can feel yourself in dorne,maaren,kings landing, winterfell or black castle. story gets you in and you want view this great serie again and again. in most of series we wait for good end,but in this serie not like this. you should not treat anything as a guarantee. thank you for amazing story with amazing world,game of thrones."
2021-04-11,ficken_58,Would have been 10* but for season 8,6,"i was in love with the show, i was ready to buy the dvd set as soon as it all finished but season 8 was the biggest let,down ever. in one season it destroyed every character or plot line to the point where none of what happened to them previously really meant anything. jon snow rising from the dead? jaime lannister turning against his sister for the first time, regaining his honour? it's still worth watching for the incredible lines and pearls of wisdom but it could have been so much better."
2021-10-22,joe_mama101,The Greatest,8,"even with the ending, this remains a must watch. the complex character sagas, beautiful shots, rich plot, and awesome music are incomparable in modern television. while i do not believe this is the best show ever, i can comfortably say its the greatest as there is nothing on this scale out."

2021-07-18,tarfaalmbarak,I once wished god to not take my life before GOT ended,9,3 years later and i still wish god didn't listen to me thanks to dan and dave i dreaded watching the last 2 seasons..a story of the century ruined because of human greed and ego.. what a sham and utter disappointment.i hope that was a lesson for grrm next time. don't sign off a story like that to a bunch of idiots.
2021-05-23,kannappankannan,Battle between living and death,10,"amazing story and plot. how could they can do this, i thrilled. perfect acting, making twist.i thanks to all the crew for giving ""game of thrones""yes it's violence. athan ithinta main. kollam pwoli series."
2021-05-07,baileystarr-00959,Oh man the last season though,9,"if you're going to write a script that makes us think there is hope for goodness then don't take that away in the last season. it's like watching a rocky movie, we know how it's going to end but it's the journey and that's where got got it wrong. the ending was so wrong because it betrayed us. the journey they took us on was to end up with good beating evil but they not only went a very different direction with that, they ended up ruining the franchise. the ending is the most important and they didn't deliver."
2021-06-05,rkbhargavi,Game of politics and love,9,"this series started with a bang and must say that the ending was not that exiting as expected, could have been better one but throughout the series one can learn that how bad things could get if we fall for wrong people and why we need to have boundaries for every relationship. political aspects are very well projected and intact."
2021-07-08,aycaerberkk,Best Serial!,10,there is a truth that almost the whole world accepts. the best series ever!
2021-08-29,anniemarch,Amazing show with bad ending,9,"this show is really amazing. especially first seasons. if it wasn't for the last season, i would give it 10/10. even though the last season wasn't that good, i still believe that this show belongs to one of the best shows i've ever watched."
2021-10-14,lanebusiness,"Watched it for the first time this year, wow!",10,"binged it all in 2 weeks and wow, i can see why this show is so popular.best show i have seen, nothing compares to it, and i have seen most 'popular' shows."
2021-10-17,houssamaboulakjam,Best tv show ever,1,"the only wickness in the show it's the end.drama, fantasy, battles, thriller, shocking memorable moments... all that in one show to create a big world like that and with all the details , u need to be a ginius like george rr martin , legendary characters and fabulous acting from the cast , great directing specially the battles , we enjoyed to how they killed the characters even the hero, and what discussion in the show quotes and headlines stuck with your head ...
you liked or you hated the end game of thrones still the best show."
2021-09-05,rob-ty,This is the Way... a Tv Should be,9,"it took me a decade and viewing the series...a third time to write a review.... i don't think there are any better shows than got or brb.if u r a fan of watching any tv series, u must watch this...u can't go back watching anything else after this... amazingly intriguing...against your expectations...the upside...u won't wan it to end....
the downside...season 8...its mode of ending."
2021-09-01,larkin-12128,AMAZING SHOW (Decent last season),9,"this show for the first 8 seasons is incredible and it really takes you into the world of game of thrones, the character development is amazing the storyline is amazing everything about it was incredible; however that being said the final season felt a bit rushed and that the writers could've taken more time and ended the show in a incredible way but instead it leaves you feeling kind of empty as you were hoping for a better ending in conclusion of the show. however the last season was a still good season just didn't live up to the expectations that was building from the first 8 seasons. this show is still a must watch and i can't wait for the prequel shows to come out."
2011-05-07,romboutroemer,One of the best TV series i've ever seen,10,"although i am a fan of fantasy stories (lotr, earthsea) i must say i have never heard of ""a song of ice and fire"" on which game of thrones is based. for the moment i am glad i didn't, it makes the series just the more compelling not knowing what comes next, because so far it is one of the best tv series i've ever seen. from the brilliant opening sequence (with ramin djawadi's beautiful music) to the great acting, some very memorable evil characters and especially the unpredictability of the story, i for the moment have no clue where it all will end, a bit of the lord of rings with a pinch of the sopranos, very refreshing indeed."
2021-09-26,thedirectora,Propably the best TV show ever written.,10,"although the last season didn't live up to the hype, the show as a whole is propably the best written tv show up to date. an instant classic."
2011-05-24,ememessien,9.5/10? Orly?,8,"having watched the first 3 episodes of this show, including a somewhat unpromising first, it is arguable that i should allow the plot to unravel further before passing judgement.to begin with the most positive aspect of game of thrones, there is a lot of beauty on display. it would appear that a great deal of thought and endeavour was put into the scenery and setting.however, i struggle to understand how this show has managed to garner so much in the way of positive reviews and ratings when it appears to fall down on so many levels. the casting for this show, with the exception of sean bean, is disturbingly poor. the uninspiring characters are played by a host of rustic looking actors with limited appeal. the show is further handicapped by the slothful plot progression.to surmise, the hype generated by this series is unjustified. the average rating on imdb for this show (at the time of writing) stands at 9.5/10 , is ""game of thrones"" really in the same bracket as ""the wire"" or ""the sopranos""? or even ""rome""? this series lacks so much that all truly great shows possess - namely, intuitive casting and clever or memorable dialogue. thus far ""game of thrones"" has proved to be a disappointment."
2019-05-23,jbravo11,the last season makes me not willing ever to watch GOT again!,8,"the last season killed it all for me. sorry guys but if i had 2 years to come up with ending i most definitely was gonna try harder. it seemed as they ran into it just in a hurry to finish it and left one big whole at the finish line. hbo made it even worst with 2 years of hype and promises that hey couldn't keep. yes we stood by and watched cause we had to finish it but was it any good, hell no! everything magical about the story was gone.
season 8 is the only season i am not willing to watch again and all the other episodes i have seen minimum 3 times.
did you take this 2 years just to render the glossy new opening?
shame!
i will leave the 10 star rate just for the dragons and sansa~!"
2011-06-06,stevencartwright_556,HBO bags another winner,10,"i only began watching hbo productions a few years ago, so i had some catching up to do. i started with the sopranos, and a fine choice it was. ravenous for more of the same high quality, character driven tv, i turned to deadwood. again, my selection was rewarded with some absolutely tremendous viewing. entourage, the wire, six feet under, band of brothers, oz and rome all continued to satisfy my viewing hunger. then all of a sudden around 2009. it all stopped. nothing new was out there from hbo.then out of nowhere in 2011, like a mike tyson right hook, wham! boardwalk empire came along. 12 joyous episodes of the highest quality tv around.then at just about the time i was recovering from the sheer joy of that, game of thrones came to air. not a big fan of this genre, i sat down to watch it with a critical eye.....eight episodes later, my critical eye has decided that this is probably one of the best scripted, most perfectly cast and absolutely gripping tv series i've ever watched.if like myself, you are a fan of complex human dramas, if you don't mind a bit (well a lot!) of violence and nudity, and if you love a good deal of intrigue, then this is undoubtedly a show you will enjoy.again, hbo i salute you!"
2013-08-20,bencehartl,Highly overrated,1,"charles dance said in an interview with some gentle sarcasm that he would not read the books because they are too heavy to hold. that tells it all: great artists and filmmakers are doing their best to make an hbo quality show from a pulp fiction fantasy.the story doesn't really go anywhere, characters can be killed anytime, new characters can be introduced as well, and the fantasy world is very far from believable. the budget can never be high enough to produce more than a couple of outstanding action scenes in one season so the writers (david benioff has seen better days: 25th hour, troy) have to fill the gaps with long, never,ending and quite uninteresting conversations.but, fortunately, the greatest stage actors also need the pay, so we can watch an amazing cast: sean bean, peter dinklage, michelle fairley, carice van houten, the above mentioned charles dance and so on. their presence worth watching the show.aside from that this is one of the weakest series of hbo, not even close to the quality of the wire, boardwalk empire or six feet under. the show could have told us something about human nature, power, politics, love, religion, faith and chaos, but instead of these we get a lot of nudity, pointless violence, and some hollywood clichés.you can say, it's just entertainment, so be it, but it still doesn't deserve more than 6 stars out of 10."
2014-02-19,bellock,Only Game In Town,10,"the show is one of a kind and will not be duplicated or supplanted. the books are generally a great read, and the show gets consistently more out of all the actors than any show i've seen of late.this isn't the typical american ""happy ending"" nonsense. bad things happen to good people in game of thrones. that's part of the beauty of game of thrones, your feelings aren't spared in the least. the series will break your heart, shake you up and leave you disillusioned. once you become immersed in the story and allow yourself to feel for the characters there's no turning back regardless of what happens.i've ready all the books, will own all the dvds. i'm completely captivated no matter how mad they make me! for me, there's the game of thrones and then there's everything else."
2011-05-02,ardih,A new dimension to an old story,7,"i have now watched the first 3 episodes of what will maybe be known in the future as the season 1 of the game of thrones tv mini,series - or, if fate would have it, the ""game of thrones"" season of the ""song of ice and fire"" series.yes, i do hope that all the books will be brought to life on the small screen, because the first episodes have been enjoyable to watch.when i finished the last book of the series written so far, i felt.. sad. a truly wonderful experience had ended, and the words just stopped, never again forming into new adventures, but instead staying the same on the pages. but now, we are given a new, somewhat compressed, but nevertheless enjoyable way of reliving the story. with no changes to make it a different tale, but instead with something extra - a new dimension of faces, places and voices. its a bit like looking through an old picture album with pictures from the good old days - the memories, the fantasy is your own, the pics are just there to help you remember. only that in this case, all the pictures might not be exactly as you remember them..well, in my head, ned was more noble-looking, kings landing never as sunny and catelyn stark younger. these self-made constructs are however fading and being replaced by the characters on the screen. im willing to sacrifice that for the reward of enjoying the good old story one more time, anew.and by the way, tyrion is just perfect!"
2016-11-23,marcel-haagen,too much special effects,8,"god of is known for the characters and the story, plots. but in this season i have seen a lot of special effects. like people being teleported from scene to another scene. like in old westerns the cavalry just arrives on time. i think the idea is that the starks are the underdog's. but getting hundred's of people killed to become the queen of winterfell what is the difference of ceserie bombing the sept. which direction will next season take, fantasy, super hero, a soap. i was a bit disappointed this season, its better than than most other shows. but from got i had expected more. the story line of araya stark, a girl blah blah blah, a easy why for the writers the eliminate someone. but not for the story."
2019-08-09,dvir971,The Greatest Story Ever Filmed,8,"it's nothing new that hbo always have the most ambitious projects around, but from 2011 to 2019 they gradually built what i consider the epitome of quality television, and made history. the highly talented show,runners david benioff and dan weiss took the unadaptable giant books by george r. r. martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. there are so many layers to this story, so many characters and story arcs intertwining with each other that it seems impossible to grasp one man came up with it all.the story martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and david and dan's transformation of the story to the tv medium was beautifully handled. there aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. it takes a little time to get into the show in the beginning, just because it's very different from what we are generally used to. it's one of those shows that from the very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there, and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in george's head. not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73, without getting lost in the way with loose threads.the show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the tv medium, and david and dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied, and not only a handful of hard core followers that wanted it to be a page- to-page adaption of the novels. while i enjoyed all the books and didn't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well i can see why a lot had to be cut, things don't work the same in books as in television. considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, i believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing, the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as i'm concerned.hbo really brought their a-team of directors to handle this show, as you'll find not a few episodes here that would rival works of highly acclaimed cinematic directors with 10 times the budget, whether it's a giant action episode or a well-made drama piece. the production values of the show, like many other things- again, unrivaled by anything else. if it's the locations, effects, production design, costumes, you name it- it's not for nothing it's the most emmy awarded show of all times by such a large margin. the fact the show takes place in a fantasy-medieval world gives it an edge in that matter, but the impeccable level of detail the behind-the-curtains crew puts in every frame makes it head and shoulders above everything else on tv, if not also big-budget hollywood productions. one of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is ramin djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or tv series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons, tells a complete story on its own. never seen anything like it.the fact that the show is consisting of so many different characters in different locations, with different story arcs that all, eventually, intertwine with each other only adds to the re-watchability value of the show as a whole. you have so many different types of plots, sometimes in different overall genres and such a large variety of types of characters that it's hard to get bored like you get sometimes if you watch the same linear story over and over again. the show became famous for the habit of pulling the rug underneath our feet and even if you know what's coming when you watch the show again, sometimes it's even more fun to anticipate these huge turning points and to pay attention to everything that leads there.say what you will about the final seasons, it's amazing the show started to really divide the fan base only in its very last season, that being it's eighth one- something that is ultimately unavoidable with something in that magnitude of popularity, that has so many characters and storylines for people to nit-pick from. we've seen it with the sopranos. we've seen it with seinfeld. we've seen it countless other times- if your show is popular enough and you give the audience an ending which is anything but most conventional conclusion possible- or, god forbid, an ending which is little bit brave- you are going to get the heat. we probably must address the elephant in the room, which is the controversy around the final season, even though i truly believe it'll all be gone in the wind in a few months. as i said it's expected some will be disappointed with the way elements of the story have concluded but i believe people went way overboard and overreacted with their negativity and scrutiny towards these final episodes, something that originated heavily from being swept by the negative buzz on social media. a lot of plot points that were deemed by a lot of people as ""making no sense"" from the characters perspective are, at least in my opinion, totally in line with their arcs on the show if you give a moments thought about it. after you come to the season with that approach it's pretty fun to enjoy it, having the most ambitious battle ever filmed for television directed by the amazing miguel sapochnik, few heartbreaking moments, the destructive and highly impressive fifth episode and most of all beautiful conclusions to arcs we've been following for the past 8 years. in a show this popular, when it came to writing the ending to all these story arcs it seems nowadays a writer has two choices- giving the internet audience what they always wanted and predicted or just going with your vision and making a brave ending actually staying true to the show and it's characters- which is exactly what david and dan did. though if you choose the latter option, be sure you are ready to take all the heat- and got is not merely the first example of that on television in the last couple of decades. i don't think there was anything as pop-culture as got in it's early seasons, and with the social media and internet meme-culture so present these days- this time this phenomenon was taken to heights never seen before.all these wordy descriptions couldn't however describe the experience of watching this show live as it aired. the thrill, the off-season anticipation and continuous speculations, the satisfaction of watching a new amazing episode after waiting for so long, the 8-years-long water-cooler talks and the overall influence got had on pop culture in the time it was on tv- i'm sure many of us will always remember how it felt, and i'm not sure if we'll get to experience something like that anytime soon. i already watched each season several times, probably more than any other show or movie, and i never get tired of any of it, if it's the well constructed dialogues or blood pumping action sequences. i definitely see myself still constantly revisiting seasons every once in a while from now until further notice.i think the success of the show speaks for itself- the countless awards, high acclaim from casual viewers and critics alike, the major fan following, it's influences on the television landscape and on culture in general- it's a winner in all fronts. in my personal opinion it's the greatest television series ever made, but generally speaking i think it's safe to say this show is for the ages and i think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest cinematic works ever produced. i just hope the uproar on social media will calm down eventually so we can once again all enjoy this show together. people tend to use this word too cheaply these days, but i wouldn't say game of thrones is anything short of a masterpiece."
2011-04-18,alcarius,"Fantasy at its finest, for adults!",10,"to start with, i read the books once only, got into it thanks to my friend(bless him) and when i learned that tv show is being made by hbo we all cheered, since we always said it is impossible to convert this epic story into a 2 and a half hour movie.to start the review now.the hand of the king jon arryn mysteriously died at the capitol of the seven kingdoms, making king robert baratheon travel to the most northern region of the seven kingdoms to its capitol winterfell to ask his loyal friend eddard ''ned'' stark to become his next hand of the king.the prologue, although not faithful enough to the book(yes i personally thought prologue was the best part of first book) is done good enough for audience to hook it up thinking who the hell are those things.the introduction of all the characters is done great, establishing some of relations quite well and subtle.the music is average, but it will not interfere with the whole show if it will be done the same as in first episode, the visual is stunning enough to suck you into show.the characters are well acted and nailed most of the book characters and their core. there are some minor relationship changes but its very close to the book.the newcomers will have to be patient and not give up to soon since the amount of characters and story lines might feel overwhelming but don't give up stay and a magical world of westeros will come to life infront of your own eyes conclusion: a dark fantasy world, full of realistic stories, at its best. a book in motion almost. the spirit of the story is mainly captured.overall score: 9"
2011-04-18,manuel-wohlgemuth,hmmm totally over-hyped...,7,"all these 9 and 10 reviews after 1 episodes...time for some counter,opinions...honestly, i think the series does not deliver anything new which hasn't been done in similar series such as tudors or rome or whatever...its really pretty over-hyped and all the good reviews are probably from fan boys...the storyline is pretty standard 0815 and the plot very predictable...its simply your average throne-intrigue-setting...the one thing that really annoyed me seriously was all the nudity and the fu****...sorry guys but i don't understand you americans, usually you're extremely conservative about such stuff, but with all these medieval/fantasy/historical settings your completely overdo it with the sex stuff - and this series just completely blows it out of proportions...there is sex all the time - seriously this series is more about sex then most porn i have watched...and that just gets boring really fast...please more action, more decapitating and less smushing"
2020-06-06,rodzyn1989,Wasted potential with last 2 seasons.,10,"i unfortunately cannot give this series more than the 6 for the last 2 seasons that butchered this show. it was clear that after they run out of the source material which is the books, they got lost in the narrative and gave us incomprehensive mess to destroy the build up of the first 6 seasons. such a waste indeed"
2014-07-22,fcneutral,Don't watch this... No show you view will ever affect you the same way.,1,"as the summary states, do yourself a favor and do not watch this ""tv show."" what i mean by this is that game of thrones will spoil you to the point of making you sick. nothing else you watch, on television or otherwise, will provide the gut,wrenching, tear- jerking, soul shattering moments that game of thrones causes one to feel on a regular basis. many of the emotions you experience are simply indescribable. as you watch it, it is akin riding your first roller coaster. the way that first hill makes you realize with dread that you are at the mercy of a beast; the plunge that follows, causing your insides to rise from your stomach to your throat; the countless twists and turns which momentarily lull you into a false sense of safety before jerking your body in a new direction; and, finally, when the ride is over and you struggle to regain your composure, staggering uncontrollably to return to reality's homeostasis. as an avid braveheart/gladiator/saving private ryan movie buff, this show easily rises to those levels. and, in some ways, because it is essentially a multi-hour cinema experience, game of thrones surpasses them in theatric quality. like i said, please don't watch the show. it makes you wonder all over again which rock mel gibson, ridley scott, and steven spielberg are hiding under."
2021-03-13,schwarzewenger,Not so good,8,"at first it had some charm because of its unpredictability, cruelty, unfairness, hitting the top around the second season. but it never had more to offer, and soon enough the quality has started deteriorating, with last seasons feeling like a different serial. in ten years someone new won't understand sky high ratings this movie has, because at time it was a trendy thing, easily mediocre itself."
2013-05-23,govez,This is how you turn a great story into great television,4,"the first thing you need when making a television series on this scale is a very good story. george martin wrote and continues to write a magnificent story that in many ways is on a scale similar to lord of the rings. it is more than just a fantasy adventure, it is an entire world, full of different cultures, languages and history and everything that comes from it, good and bad. what makes the television show so good is that it follows the story closely, deviating only when it must to suit the audience needs and visual requirements. no matter how good a television show is, the viewers imagination is less engaged than a readers and therefore must be served sometimes a little more blatantly.the story is in a way simple, even with a few separate areas of intrigue slowly converging, but the characters, their history, their reasons, they are complex and as such you can't just tune in and expect to be rolled along from battle to battle with the hero saving the day and winning the girl. in my opinion to truly enjoy this you need to have read at least the first book if not all of them so far. the books build the world in a way that it is difficult for a television series or film to do. the detail combined with time and your imagination are what makes it so impressive. the negative comments i've seen here all appear to stem from that very issue. no plot they say, yet there are many and they are so realistic it's fascinating. too much sex and gore, yet this is a medieval setting, a very real and not so distant past should tell us that life in those times and places was often grim and usually short. i even saw one who scored it 1 out of 10 and opened with ""i don't like fantasy stuff"" which reminded me neatly not to have the omelette for lunch as i don't like eggs.read the books , watch the show. but pay attention. life is interesting because of the little things, the details, the nuances. that as much as the visual effects and scenes is what makes this a television masterpiece."
2012-05-14,damianski23,A Legacy to Remember,9,"i am an addict. i love movies as i love tv series, drama, comedy, war  all genres. as long as a production has something to give, to pass to its audience, i watch it.i'll start by saying that lord of the ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movie series ever made. it made me drift into this fantasy world, full of magic and beauty complemented by blood and hate. game of thrones is the single tv series that has brought me close to that feeling of warmth and for that, thank you! it tells a story on many planes that always intercept at some point, it links the power of name and blood to the will of the people, it gives meaning to the word 'honor' and it surely makes you step into another dimension, that of kings and magic. i'm not talking about real magic, or not the 'harry potter' type at least, but about the magic of life, love and power. you barely can handle the week between the episodes, keen to see what comes next, what will that lord do and how will that prisoner escape, keeps you on your toes. it gives you the feeling of 'everlasting', wishing that it will actually last forever because: it's that good!i will end by saying that this series is unique compared to all tv series i've seen, better than rome, spartacus, the tudors, etc it's the closest you can get to the 'nobleness' it stands for so proudly."
2011-04-23,hg9276,Long Live the Seven Kingdoms of Westeroes,7,"for those of you who are not familiar with ""a song of ice and fire"" fantasy series comprising of 4 novels till date by george r. r. martin, hbo presents to you an opportunity to indulge in a medieval fantasy drama, an epic tale of seven noble families of a continent ""westeroes"", fighting amongst themselves to control the iron throne. george r. r. martin had conceptualized the fantasy novel, a saga of warfare among the various tribes of westeroes, after working for various television shows in the 1980s such as beauty and beast, twilight zone etc, as screenwriter. the writer after publishing 4 novels surrounding the throne, considered the conception of a television series a rare possibility, since the channels had argued that novel involves a large number of characters and possibly, requires a high budget. however, the premiere has been appreciated by martin, who applauded the impeccable depiction of the world by creators david benioff and d.b. weiss.the series has been appreciated widespread after an extensive promotion, for instance, u.k. viewers clumped to the debut on sky atlantic of ""game of thrones"", and acknowledged the series better than earlier signature show ""boardwalk empire"". according to a wide majority of viewers, the series may not be comparable to ""lord of rings"" as was speculated, but definitely regarded it as an excellent adaptation of the novel and further complemented the work of biggie ""sean bean"" who plays lord eddard stark.hbo has further renewed the series for a second season. the pilot titled ""winter is coming"" was slow and introductory, an indication to the superb series that will follow. the episode illustrated how king baratheon suspected an uprising against him following the death of his adviser, and calls for the help of lord eddard. the start of the episode was thrilling, nerve,reeking by the presence of ""white walkers"", the ""others"" you know, if you have read the novel, the first in the series. the man who survived and later executed as a deserter was one of the night watchers who guarded the wall which barred the passage of ""others"". since, the others were not seen for thousands of years, lord eddard played by sean regarded the man's claim to have seen them baseless and utter madness. the last scene where jamie pushes the boy off the tower after he saw him with queen cersei would have totally put viewers on edge. i adored the last shot, and is definitely a good move to retain and bring back viewers.i loved the first episode, it gave me the feeling that series will be awesome, and would eventually get better. since, the creators have stuck to the original story, supported by exemplary acting, and art direction, it will propel. it is a high budget series by hbo with a season estimation of us$60 million, even greater than rome, and good for hbo the series has received positive reviews, with the pilot suspected to have fetched us$2.5 million overseas. thus, the series promises umpteen entertainment for adults."
2011-06-25,sergio-queirozz,Missing some key scenes..,10,"first of all, english is not my main language, so.. forgive my mistakes.i read the first book about 6 months ago and i absolutely love it. drama, war, amazing characters (and a lot), deep and original story. when i first hear about the adaptation, i was very happy, because hbo has a great history of making epic series (band of brothers, the pacific and many others) and this one can't be different.after watch the first episode, i was concerned because they rushed too much and i know that people who don't read the book would be lost, like my girlfriend did.. but, they really choose well the actors and the atmosphere was perfect (medieval, but with a nice touch of fantasy).if the history don't get you attention and you don't try very hard to understand, the first 3 or 4 episodes may be very ""boring"", because is very hard to understand what is the 7 kingdoms and how big they are..after watch all the 10 episodes, i was pleased, but some key battle scenes have been changed and bother me: i) the fight of the tywin lannister against the small army that robb stark send to distract him.. where they adapt the scene in a way that tyrion lannister don't made nothing.. just ""sleep"" thru the whole battle.ii) and the riverrun battle, who the series don't show and it is the biggest and complex fight of the first book (game of thrones), where robb annihilate jaime lannister army and capture him..anyway.. most of the scenes was a really great adaptation, except the ""random porn scenes"", with don't seems like medieval nudity.. just regular light porn. i give a 7, because the book is way better."

2019-11-14,jgoad77,One of the Best TV Series Ever!!!,9,"i was one of those people who came late to the party.but right from the 1st episode i was hooked.i have never read the books, so season after season i was astonished by the plot twists.this series keeps breaking your heart but you kept coming back for more.i'm so sorry that it came to an end but guess what?i've been watching it again with a friend.and you know what, it's just as good the second time around!!10 out of 10"
2011-04-17,mbanat,The hype has been over done,2,"the pr for the series has been that it is good enough to be considered a ""lord of the rings"" quality/genre project for tv. not quite. it plays an awful lot like an old 1950's universal studios medieval potboiler. the sort of thing you would expect to see tony curtis or alan ladd in. it certainly isn't up to the normal hbo standard when compared with a production like ""rome"". maybe, as the series progresses, a stronger storyline might start to appear. the production values are handsome enough for tv, but overall the atmosphere is very dull. by and large, the cast seems to be not overly interested in the material. they could be waiting to see some improvement before they bother trying."
2012-07-11,dbt25677,A disgusting abomination.,9,"this television series is absolutely disgusting. the storyline is inconsistent and there is so much unnecessary nudity and sex scenes. it is horrendous and it completely escapes me how people manage to enjoy this garbage. there is actually a scene in one of the episodes when someone gets grumpy after failing a jousting tournament, pulls out a sword and cuts a horses head off. like, actually off of it's body. there is another scene in the same episode in the same situation (a jousting tournament) where someone gets a joust stuck in their throat and they start vomiting blood. i hope this series gets stopped soon, it is absolutely disgusting and gut,wrenching. my peers and siblings seem to enjoy it because of the occasional sex scene. it is so stupid that they would put pornographic scenes in this television show. i have no idea why such great actors would join this trash. probably the worst show i have ever experienced and would rather watch my little pony than this stupid worthless trash which i hope gets removed before it damages anyone else. get rid of it now. 0/10."
2011-04-29,shaen_cool,HBO Does it again!,3,"let me start from the expectations which grew as soon as i heard that they are making a tv series on book (thanks god not a movie). then came the poster with sean bean sitting on a throne and that said it all.if you are looking for some real medieval epic adventure this show is for you, even if not do watch it and you will be amazed by the way it is presented. i loved the pilot and desperately looking forward to the next episodes( wish it will not discontinued). direction is brilliant, locations are amazing, acting does justice to the show. a dark show with very serious theme, background score is great by ramin djawadi (prison break). all in all a great new show on tv."
2011-05-28,andreas-jacobsson,Brought tears to my eyes,1,"let me first state that i have not read the books, so any and all of my opinions are solely based on this series.so, what do i think of it? well, to be honest i think it is the best tv series i have ever seen in my currently 33 years of life! i admit that i might be a little biased as i usually have a thing for the ""fantasy"" genre, but i guarantee that anyone who feels that way will absolutely love this. i have only seen up to episode 6 as of this review, and i will not make any comments about the characters or the story, as i do not want to introduce any spoilers, but so far the quality of this series (in everything) is just breathtaking. i could not be happier!"

2011-10-13,sjobba11,Game of Thrones - A 'to-be' cult classic,10,"game of thrones is the new epic series from hbo(flight of the conchords, band of brothers, the pacific, entourage). as most productions from this network, high quality and high production value is always on top. game of thrones is no exception. based on the book ""a song of fire and ice' by george r.r. martin.set in the fantasy world known as 'the seven kingdoms', we get to follow the stark family. they live in a world where winters can be as long as a lifetime and summers last several years. however, ""winter is coming"". however, tales of white walkers, dead who rises from their graves, used to scare the children might turn out to be true.as the people hurry to prepare for the coming cold, there is a rivalry between the ruling families in the kingdom. the starks and the lannisters are long time enemies, only the king's rule have kept them at bay. lannisters, the riches faction in the kingdom, has claims on the throne. meanwhile, eddard stark rushes to the capital, king's landing, to help his old friend and the king to ensure the peace is kept. but that might be harder than expected when lannisters plot for the throne. tension is high to say the least.a cross the sea, the old ruler, the family targaryen, also plots for the throne. they allies with the mighty dothrakie. together, they march for king's landing, for war and for the throne. let the game of thrones begin.there is a lot to say about game of thrones , the amazing story, incredible settings and production. the costumes, scenery, dialogs, make-up and cgi. what stands out the most, however, is the cast.scratch that. peter dinklage. this is one of those rare moments in television when you realize that this person has been born with one purpose - to play this part. like alan rickman was born to play professor snape, brad pitt to play tyler durden and johnny depp to play jack sparrow, peter dinklage is so realistic and true to his role it's scary. i am truly glad he won the emmy. cudos, peter!! all in all, it is in many aspects the perfect series. i would have given it a full ten, but i find the dothrakie(i can admit, i don't know how it is spelled) language annoying. and some of the sex scenes is completely irrelevant. perhaps they will tone it done till the next season.this is a ""must watch"". so, watch it. and enjoy it."

2012-01-09,anotheremail345,Another one...,9,"game of thrones is another one of those series that follows the trend of exploiting violence and sex to draw in an audience. sex and violence would not, in themselves, be a problem, had they any context or relevance to the story of the development of the characters. unfortunately, this is not the case here. the series follows the story of a number of 'noble families' with fights for power and political intrigue occurring against a backdrop of a fabulous and fantastic world. the premise has potential, however the result is poor. the story is predictable and has been covered from a number of angles. the characters are one,dimensional, either good or bad, no in-between. the only exception to this being tyrion lannister, who makes quite an interesting character. there is a constant display of gratuitous violence that is displayed as if normal for the time. seeing that this is fantasy, there is no historical accuracy to maintain, the violence and sexuality displayed are merely a choice of the writers and not historical depictions of a time and place that does not exist in the first place. also worrying is the normalisation of the mistreatment of women. not only there are numerous prostitutes to pleasure the men in many occasions (and not useful for anything else), women are often referred to as 'whores'. it begs belief that this sort of misogynistic behaviour, which is offered as that of 'noble men' and therefore normalised, does not raise eyebrows or even disgust but instead praise and a number of golden globe nominations. the acting is far from fantastic and what is it with those english accents coming up randomly? there are instances where the series shows potential and the characters display interesting and unexpected behaviour. unfortunately this is not as often as it could be to support such as basic story."
2015-06-24,melssnailshop,Perhaps the most overrated show to ever exist,8,"where game of thrones stumbles is it's (dis)ability to properly handle characters and a story at once. the creators of this show are apparently bound on showing needless scenes of naked woman belittling themselves in every episode. nothing is right with that statement. just because your show is on hbo doesn't mean nudity needs to appear whenever possible. see silicon valley, why can't all hbo shows handle nudity like that? oh yeah, because game of thrones needs an audience. strip the nudity and you have a worthless show that may be the most atrocious thing to ever exist. perhaps you will all see come the final season, because eventually the writers have to stop daydreaming of women and actually make a television show."
2019-05-21,blazaxx13,So much potential,6,"had some of the best written story development in any show ever, then completely turned itself inside out and had the absolute worst last 2 seasons ever."
2014-01-25,rockjaguar514,Winter is Coming,10,"hbo has really outdone themselves this time by ordering 'game of thrones'! several months ago i refused to watch this show because i don't like the fantasy genre, but i decided to buy the first episode on itunes, then i became addicted. i ordered hbo and watched it on demand. this show has everything: violence, drama, sex, and surprising moments. 'game of thrones' is an outstanding idea. the writing, acting, directing, and effects are unbelievable. but a lot of main characters die very upsetting and shocking deaths. i recommend this show to anyone who loves violent dramas. but head's up: there is a lot of graphic sex and nudity. that's why it is on hbo."
2021-05-03,koudielolz,One of the greatest tv shows suffers from what will go down as one of the worst ending fails in tv history.,1,"easily one of the greatest tv shows of all time if you don't watch the 8th season. it's rare that a show or film is so great and because of its ending it then loses its greatness and great reputation. this is one of those cases. this show had everything, and because of the writers not having enough respect for the audience, the characters, the story, and not even enough respect for the craft of writing, they genuinely put a giant stain onto this show. if you watch got, i genuinely recommend stopping at the end of season 7. or stop after season 8 right after the battle of winterfell. i know almost everyone that rewatched the show will probably stop there to avoid the anger and disappointment of the last season, in hopes of holding onto the greatness that once was.now i've ranted about the ending, but let me say that the first 6,7 seasons are genuinely incredible (season 7 loses some quality and is rushed but it still was at least good). this was a fantastic show until the end and i wish that the writers had kept some small morsel of their integrity and gave us a well done ending. (i don't even mind each characters fates, i don't like how poorly the story was told, it was genuinely thrown away with no care in the world) i would have rated this show a 9 or even a 10 had the last season been up to par on its story telling, but due to the last season literally throwing away everything that the first 7 seasons had built up, i am only rating the show a 7 out of 10 because i genuinely felt disrespected. i'm still upset about it.let's raise a glass to what was and what could have been!"
2014-10-16,zruiz7,Great show accompanied by even better novels,1,"this show is very well done. it is not often that the tv show/film will come so close to the books as far as quality and similarity. it is obviously hard to provide as much in depth character and scene descriptions as the books do. however, the books are also about 1,000 pages each.if you have not seen the show, i would highly recommend giving it a try. very easy to get hooked instantly. i saw the first 2 seasons before deciding to read the books. i have a job and go to school so you can understand why i was hesitant. it is definitely a time commitment. my girlfriend was not pleased, but i am halfway through the 3rd book after a month and would even say these surpass tolkien's work (barely).all in all, no one i have talked to personally has disliked the show. i do not think you will either. very entertaining!"
2020-04-21,gunjanvikash,SHAME SHAME SHAME,10,"the 7 stars are for the first 7 seasons .the 3 missing stars are for the most badly written season of tv history.all the great work of first 7 seasons is undone in this ugliest season of tv.its not about what fans want its about reason and rationale.some notable points,---1. at the end of season 7 jon and daenerys are in love . although it was not developed well by the writers still it seemed to be pure. she comes to save him, waits for him on the wall, cries when she sees his scars , kit and emilia act beautifully so much so it does not look like acting but looks something real. the season culminates with two soulmates with each other . start season 8 and they ( writers) tear their love to shreds mercilessly thinking they are gods writing destiny . its a tv show for gods sake . give people hope and happiness in a tv show for there is enough trouble and agony in life.
they do not stop at that . they quickly make daenerys a mad and heartless queen and make jon murder his love for "" duty "". alas for the king that was promised .
i am sure they ( writers) drove sadistic pleasure with this butchery of hopes.2. fans never liked sansa right from the first season and she is made lady of winterfell for breaching jon's trust and hating him through childhood.3. the battle with the dead is poorly filmed and written.i can keep ranting about all there was wrong with this season apart from actingand music . this season broke my heart ............"
2020-05-02,dragos_matei_serban,Season 8 was great,1,"you have to watch the entire series and not take 2 years to come up with theories between the seasons. even in the early episodes, robert and ned were discussing the dothraki eventually invading and destroying all of westeros. daenerys was no hero."
2018-11-15,maudivdv,#forthethrone,8,"#forthethrone it's just, game of the edge of your seat, game of the most amazing actors, game of best twists. when that intro starts you just hum along (or scream in my case) with excitement. oh right, game of best intros. just watch it. if you haven't who are you really?"
2019-05-14,gandhiji-454-727253,Disappointing conclusion,1,"the first seasons are very well made and exciting. but the more they start to deviate from the books, the worse it gets. the problem is not going off the original, that's fine. the problem is their writers can't manage it. there is a serious decline in interesting writing or plot. it's especially clear in the last season, which is nothing but an endless parade of unfinished story arcs, anti climaxes and battle scenes where you can't see a thing that's happening and completely illogical nonsensical desicions. (like placing seige equipment at the front and only having them fire blindly once in one particularly badly done battle). it's very sloppy, it feels like the creators didn't have good enough help with writing and directing after the series started deviating from the source material. don't watch the last season. i would give it 7/10 if it wasn't for the last season. or just watch the six first seasons and pretend it ended there. you will just be hugely dissatisfied if you watch the last few seasons since nothing is properly concluded."
2019-06-14,gauravgupta-455-477960,Very Interesting Watch,6,"got is a fantasy series shot in some wonderful locales (mostly eastern europe , i believe) and is a ""period drama."" there are a number of twists and turns thereby making the unexpected happen and sometimes even breaking your heart when some of your favourite characters are bumped off. sadly - it seems the producers wanted to end it in a hurry and some of the episodes especially in the final season - are vapid and merely time consuming.there's a lot of violence, blood, gore, skin, sex and fantasy. nearly every woman of consequence is made to strip which i found to be totally unnecessary and out of context. dead people are brought back to life - pandering to public (viewers') sentiments. as a production it is huge !! fantastically crafted and interwoven sub-plots - and it is a must watch.if there's anything that i personally did not like - it's the fact that there are too many characters in play and some episodes end up wasting a lot of time on absolutely nothing.all in all - what is good - far out-shadows what is bad. i gave it 9/10 that means do see it once at least."
2019-02-02,charliestgermain,"Without a doubt, the best series EVER!",4,"i tried to watch got a few years back and made it through about 20 minutes before i changed the channel, disgusted by an overhyped series that garnered more attention than any other show before it. i admit, i was apprehensive before i even started it and my perception was that it sucked so it truly didn't stand a chance. fast forward to spring of 2018, my friend was watching the first episode, right about where i had turned it off, and i expressed my aforementioned opinion of it to him. he implored me to give it another try. so i did, with an open mind, and a better attitude, got quickly became not only a great show, but it was inciting extreme interest like no other series i had ever experienced. so began the binging, and it didn't stop until i was out of new content. this show has a unique way of presenting characters that at first, you can't stand, but come to love and cheer for as the story unfolds. in fact, the characters i disliked the most, typically became my favorites and that was a clever and deliberate dynamic that keeps on coming and is only the beginning of so many in this formula. the writing and story arcs are absolutely some of the finest i've ever experienced and again, the character development is in a class of its own. the biggest and possibly only blaring issue i have with got is that it's coming to an end, but that's also what makes this show such a treasure to so many people. i've never really ""bought in"" to the high fantasy genre over the years. in fact, it was always probably my least favorite of them all. i hope this review can inspire more viewers like me, who have either been closed minded due to the hype surrounding it, or some other reason to give this masterpiece a chance to win them over. game of thrones is my absolute favorite series ever and i can't express enough just how unique and original it is. through this experience, i've come to understand as it relates to got, there are two types of people in this world: those who love it, and those who haven't seen it yet. winter is coming....."
2020-11-30,tayeb-montazer,A unique series that was destroyed ...,7,"gut was my whole life, but he ruined everything in the last season !!! i feel sorry for the directors who destroyed such a unique series !!!"
2014-01-09,abcdanny,A must watch for everyone with an imagination!,9,"its heartwarming to finally see the budgets that go into blockbuster movies finally making its way to tv series.game of thrones is addictive to say the least, the vast amount of important charterers (not even the nerdiest of nerds could name them all) and each character having a detailed plot line and plenty of screen time means there are plenty of favorites to pick from. but don't start latching onto your favorite just yet because what keeps game of thrones so griping is that no character is safe. george r.r. martin has had me at many occasions saying ""what the ef just happened"" or ""shouting no no noooo!"" as i watch my favorite character whom i thought was invincible getting the axe. anyway overall i would recommend this series to anyone and everyone (i have) because it is truly one of the greats and will sit on the top 5 tv series list for quite some time , 10/10"
2019-05-20,syed-ahmad,All along this was about the Iron throne represented.,6,"the iron throne , root of all the corruption and evil has been cleansed with fire 🔥 for as long as that iron throne stood, blood was spilled, bodies were burnt and a thirst for power that breeded corruption all across the seven kingdoms.this was not about who would sit on the iron throne, this was about what the iron throne represented, pure evil and madness, which ironically was built on a foundation of mad conquests by aegon targaryen.you see, the iron throne was cursed and all the people who touched it were haunted and were drove towards madness.so the odds had to be evened with the opposite of what it represented ice.for without the night king, men would have continued this madness for eternity.while all the world will sing the song of ice and fire for decades to come.this is the only way peace would last in the seven kingdoms of westeros."
2019-05-14,fathergoose9090,Fantastic show until the last season when they phoned it in,10,this show has been my favorite on air for the longest time. i would have given it a 10/10 but season 8 has been nothing but a constant let down.
2019-05-21,fathergoose9090,Season 8 almost sunk the series,10,"for a long while now i've considered this show my favorite series. season 1,7 were wonderful, full of epic cinematic scenes, inspired acting, and fantastic writing. season 8 on the other hand, while still possessing the cinematic and acting (for the most part), severely lacks in the writing department. dan and dave seemed to have gotten the disney project and said, ""game of thrones who, eh just pump something out quick they'll watch it anyway"". honestly i would have been okay with the decisions made had there been more story as to why and less foreshadowing and gaps."
2019-05-20,shendelenin,Changed my 10 to 8 after Finale season,9,why? i mean why? why ruined the show like this in season 8 after taking a long 2 years gap to make it? d & d should have learned from breaking bad finale season..
2019-07-23,rw4125,Great series that fell off at the end,6,"game of thrones is sure one of the most remarkable tv series that you can find. unfortunately quality of writing fell off, firstly slowly after season 4, and then more and more towards the end.
still a great series that i definitely recommend to watch.here is how i'd rate the seasons:
season 1,4: 9-10 stars
season 5-6: 7-8 stars
season 7-8: 6 starsgot proves that the most important basis of any story is good writing.
once this is gone even good acting, directing and special effects can't make up for it.besides this, trying to shove your political agenda into the viewer faces (eg look at the amount of totally out of the line ""strong women"", particularly from season 6 onward) also doesn't make your story better."
2019-07-28,cheeseman1975,Peace of f### sh###,10,"this series has probably disappointed the last humans on this planet. nobody, really nobody will ever look at this sh## again. 7 seasons best entertainment are destroyed by a hectic, totally overloaded stupid end. worst script of all time. so sad."
2013-03-11,davidsplee,Unbelievable! One of the best or THE best series ever! MUST WATCH,10,"i do not know why people complain of too much skin and no plot....so maybe just maybe the sex is too much but it,in no way interferes with the plot or the storyline in such a way that the viewer loses interest in the show, the show gathered up so many unexperienced actors (with the exception of sean bean,lena headey,nikolaj,costau waldow and peter dinklage) and made it one of the best acted and vastly storylined tv shows of all time,following the books written by george martin (dubbed by many as the successor of j.r.r tolkien) but if you are a fan of fairy tales this show is not for you. i cannot believe why this show is shut out in almost all the award shows as it obviously deserves to win a lot more awards than it already has as it is the highest ranked tv series still continuing,along with breaking bad (another must watch show) in imdb. 10/10 an unbelievably awesome tv show"
2018-11-24,bare_tedi67,Can't wait,10,for the next episode after that beautiful blue dragon fire! why does it have to be the last season ?
2019-03-10,bare_tedi67,I can't believe I didn't start watching this till last year,10,i do wish it had more longevity and never ended. this is the first show i ever binge watched every season in my life !!
2013-06-10,rekomstop,One of the Top 5 Best TV Shows EVER. Period.,5,"i just had to make an imdb account specifically to rate this show. there are a lot of ridiculously harsh reviews of this show that i find absurd.the most common complaint seems to be too much sex. this is an hbo show. yes, it will have more sex than any show you find on regular cable. but does it really have more sex than the tudors or spartacus, two really great premium channel shows? i find a lot of the sex is necessary to define the character's personalities and motives. the writers had to be creative here because it's not as if they can just describe the characters exactly the way the author described them in the book. people tend to show who they really are on the inside when they are having sex.there seems to be a lot of viewers that don't like the show because ""it isn't the genre they care for."" if you watched this show and expected it to be anything less than an a violent, vulgar, epic, sexy fantasy story, then you must've been prepared to watch twilight, and not game of thrones.what makes this show so great is how quickly the story can change, even when it seems to violate tv show norms (i.e killing off a main role). unfortunately, we can't really give the writers credit here, as they are just following the story.game of thrones almost seems like it was written to be a tv show in the sense that it is entirely unpredictable. if you've never read the books, you will never be able to guess which direction the show will start to go in and just when you think you've got it all figured out, something will change, leaving you guessing again and just dying to know what happens next."
2019-05-23,cadet_abbadi,Still the best tv show,10,"about got finale i think that after the writers d&d made mistakes in the previous episodes thus the final episode was fair enough its true its not the best ending but this season was not that bad everything was great expect the writing so focusing in one aspect is never fair to the cast and crew that have worked very hard to do the best they could. also, to be fair for those who rate the show 1 out of 10 i think they don't deserve to watch a minute of this great tv show and they are ungrateful to the previous seasons plus in term of being fair you must at least take an average rating for all the seasons to rate the show so due to the mistakes in the final season i gave it 9 because it doesn't deserve a 10 but it was phenomenal."
2019-05-26,rodneycallum6,Game of Thrones Season eight episode five,10,"hi rodney callum cannot believe i am dismayed shocked what the writers and directors and producers . i have been watching game of thrones wrong in the last eight years everyone and i mean everyone has grown up as insured so much shocking trials and tribulations in eight years .i've seen in the show grow from girls boys just trying to escape to stay alive from girls being sold like cattle from people they've gone through amazing situations .it felt like i've been there experience what they experience from outside person looking in.from a girl walking into fire and surviving being kidnapped and surviving from people you didn't know who you was going to follow if it was you .i am distraught not suicidal by the way how could a brilliant show and we think this is going to be a blu,ray moment or ultra 4k moment to buy at a shop you guys end up with episode five the writers should be lined up and taken out the producers should be hung and quartered you guys took two years i have waited two years knowing that you take your time and you guys messed up royally messed up a ultimate show a person will take out slavery a good decent girl even i would follow and made it atrocious . i think you guys are been on drugs i think the police should test the directors produces the writers because you guys should be in prison you are ruined the whole of eight years of ultimate awesome show.there is no way the lady dragons would do what she done don't get me wrong due to checking out the building and not everyone what is wrong with you guys .it's a bit like waiting for a tyson fight all night long any goes on bites the guys ear off pointless exercise you guys on something and it's sad awful so if you guys you guys have ruined the whole of game of thrones there was no way she would act that way . taking out women and kids children she thought that all her life there was just no way you guys need a slap"
2019-05-04,goleprateek,One of the best/worst show ever.,5,"best: right up to the point they had source material worst: as soon as they ran out of booksone of the best (essential) character on the show, logic, died after season 4,5. the creators d&d (short for dumb and dumber) are apparently a couple of talent-less hacks, they hardly have anything original on their cv."
2019-05-21,themetaldepth,Let's just pretend season 8 didn't happen,10,"if it wasn't for season 8 i would have given it a 10. season 1,4 was amazing, 5 and 6 were very good too. 7 wasn't as good as the other seasons and 8 was just... ehh... let's not talk about that.looks like we'll be waiting for grr martin to release the book, so we can know how it actually ends!"
2019-01-21,shahem_sharaf,I love this show !!!!,10,"it doesn't matter if you aren't into fantasy series , because i am pretty sure you are gonna fall in love with this show . it is so well done and scripted that you wouldn't want the series to end.unfortunetlly it is r rated and there are many nudity scenes especially in the first seasons , i wouldn't recommend anyone under 18 or anyone who isn't comfortable with perverted scenes and sexual references to watch it.
i would like to rate the seasons of the show as well ,
the first 6 seasons are 9/10
the 7th was fine
and as you know the finale was the worst (updated)
unpopular opinion if you didn't like the show no need to crap about it just let it go , so what if the ending was bad , doesn't make it the worst show , i hope hbo sees that ending and criticism as a motivation to make better spinoffs , and if not it was a fun ride , i did enjoy the first 6 seasons ( r rated scenes excluded) .
thanks for reading this ."

the made a masterpiece that will hardly be repeated!
unfortunately ruined it with the worst last season, that i hope people will forget and keep remembering how fascinating the game of thrones once was."
2021-01-10,wim_vg-1,I am sad...,4,"i watched this show looking forward to each and every season and episode. the storytelling and character development is wonderful and it is an incredible achievement exploring such a vast world.the last season turned it around for me, to where this show practically has no more rewatch value and seems to slip my thoughts faster than any other great show i have watched.every episode of the last season i was checking imdb and surprised to see the ratings plummet further down with each episode. i always told myself: ""oh, it cannot be that bad, right?"" and sat down to watch. while i watched through each episode of season 8, i started to realize; for me those ratings are probably right...i envy those that liked the final season, for they will remember this show for what it should be worth. i cannot avoid feeling incredibly sad about it."
2017-08-26,martyftw,"Watched the rest, now watch the best.",7,"i have watched a lot of tv shows and in my option this is the best tv series so far in my 48 years on this spinning ball, the acting, writing, directing and production and the rest is phenomenal. in july 2015 i made a top ten list on imdb putting the sopranos at number one, have now given the number one spot to game of thrones, will my number one spot change in the future, anything is possible, game of thrones will be very hard to beat, i think it has set an exceptionally high bar."
2019-05-23,arpit-sharma86,Best to the worst,7,"it was an event to watch got every year till season 7 . what the hell happened in season 8 . bad script , loop holes , weak screenplay , destroyed all characters , unnecessary scenes completely abrupt non sense ending . i can't believe who approved this script .i wish it was better"
2019-05-20,lukemcghee,It has its burps,2,it has some burps but is still one of the best shows iv ever seen. and for that i have to give it a 10
2019-05-13,abdelilah_1991,I GIVE IT 7,9,it could be better maybe shorter also some things are not making sense at all should be edited or removed thats my opinion
2014-09-29,luisa-gohr-119-659213,"Incredible, great show, but sometimes a little bit too bloody",9,"that ""game of thrones"" is one of the best show which has ever been produced for tv, can't barely be denied, even if there are also many people who cannot really understand that opinion. it seems to be a matter of taste. nevertheless, in my opinion, the incredible brutality which takes place regularly on screen, sometimes seems to be a little bit exaggerated. of course it makes the show even more thrilling and fascinating. but i would say, you can also make a good tv,show without that amount of blood. there are enough others which proved that. i think the reason for the producers to use so much blood, is that they wanted to separate from other medieval fantasy shows. and they succeeded.but nonetheless, despite of the maybe appropriated critique, the show still is most likely one of the best ones i've ever seen. of course, the show is definitely nothing for the faint-hearted people, but for all the others it is clearly worth to watch it, if you haven't done that so far.i hope there are not too many mistakes in my text. if there are, i'm sorry, but i'm no native speaker."
2019-05-04,nomar256,Episode 3,10,i changed my rating after season 8 episode 3 was an embarrassing performance by got writers. how can you let us down like that? the biggest battle and a poorly episode.
2018-09-10,robertomgcruz,Best series ever,4,"impeccable series in all topics. perfect adaptation. nice choose of actors and actresses. really good script with so many plot twists and all of them was made in a so good manner. perfect timing. we see the quality of the effects increasing due the success of the series but, even then, good choices to keep the story flowing in a way that you don't want to stop seeing. congratulations. perfect!"
2019-05-08,anandz4,Started off well but is declining rapidly,7,"i never watched this show until recently when i was laid up after surgery. binged on all seasons over a month and a half. the show has plenty of sex and violence but the narrative is rich even with well,developed characters. the show, in my opinion, peaked during mid season and the last two seasons have been very uneven. too much filler. season 8 has been somewhat of a disappointment. at this point i think the writers are simply to end with some sort of resolution for the many characters and storylines and it feels rushed. i think hbo's westworld is superior (at least the first season) as well as starz's counterpart. as to who wins the iron throne, it is anybody's guess but my bet is on the dragon queen. jon snow is already dead and will probably die a noble second death saving his queen. one of the characters has to die and why not kill the one who was already dead?"
2016-07-11,mreviewer82,Best TV Show ever,10,"i was blown away by this show from start to finish. i couldn't believe how rich and spectacular the visuals were, how first,rate and technically marvelous the entire production was. but as much if not more so than the production itself, the intricate story lines and deeply complex characters make this show how deservedly popular and lauded it is. rarely has there been a medieval, fantasy epic this rife with feeling, passion, betrayal, slaughter, and downright twists and turns. with a terrific ensemble cast and special effects that make the most expensive hollywood blockbusters look unimpressive, ""game of thrones"" has left its mark on the zeitgeist as the show to beat in television history."
2016-07-02,dimni_sergio,A very beautiful sh*t,1,"the most overrated show out there,after season 2 the writing of this show is so bad.the showrunners hate characters like stannis,and because of their hate and misunderstanding of the character they butcher his whole story,line,they love characters like tyrion,jon and daenerys and they always make them look like heroes,when this show started no one everything was unpredictable while now and especially in season 6 everyone predicted everything just from the very first trailer.the writers choose only to kiss a** and do only what the fans want.from a good show that everything that happened mattered now daenerys,tyrion,jon and arya have plot armors and do whatever they want without any consequence.i know i sound like a hater but as a book reader comparing the quality of the writing between the books and the show,i see that the show is just awful,i don't want an exact copy of the books,because the show is an adaptation but i can't stand this stupid fan-fiction,even grrm himself called the show a fan-fiction(3 out of 10 only for the high budget,great visuals and good actors that this show used to have e.x charles dance,stephen dillane etc.)"
2019-05-20,jontn777,Can we stop at season 7?,10,"this show is simply amazing. got is hands down the best show in tv history, which makes it that much more disappointing that the writers of the show gave up in the last season. there's no other way to put it. they rushed the whole last season, and boy does it show. the last season, particularly the last episode really dropped down 2 stars for me. sad to see such a great show get such a mediocre ending."

please remake this season finale."

2019-05-20,waleedwm,Amazing show,8,the best tv show but season 8 is bad 9/10 thanks gorge r r martan c
2019-04-29,shk-73240,Good God this sucks,3,"lame storytelling. whenever you need the writers, directors, etc. come on to explain the show after the fact means the storytelling and writing wasnt strong enough to stand on its own. these hacks benihoff and the other guy have to insist what they did was good by telling us what and why they did it....pathetic."
2018-04-08,everettgamer,"Confusing, Boring, and Nonsensical",6,"every time i get free hbo i give this show a try, and every time it never fails to confuse and bore me, and i turn it off ten minutes in. how does a viewer of this garbage keep track of the families and their members without a score card? what is with the zombie skeletons and the dragons? if i wanted to watch a ""dark ages"" type of show, i watch ""vikings"", ""the last kingdom"" or ""the bastard executioner"", at least those shows are easy to keep up with and have history as a reference point, and no dragons and zombies as distractions. how ""game of thrones"" won so many awards and is now ingrained in popular culture is beyond me and demonstrates the shallowness of the producers/writers of this crap and the low expectations the viewing public has for television entertainment."
2020-12-15,antefilipi,The only tv show that could rival breaking bad,2,"honest review of this show would be an 8 or even maybe a 7 but i gave it a 9 bcs i refuse to belive this was ruined by those incompetent idiots. tbh this show started going downhill ever since jon snow was revived, they revived him just bcs fans wanted it. season 8 is just the climax of stupidity by these two ""creators""."
2018-10-18,lynxdt,One of the best shows in Television History!,10,"i can't say much about how great the show is without spoiling it. it's just amazing. the rich intense backstory is impeccable and the character development is noteworthy. from violence, gore, sex, to dragons, zombies, other mythical creatures, the show has it all that requires for it to be an extraordinary true,to-book fantasy series. every episode is densely packed with story. every move, every twitch, every word, everything a character does is important to the story. all in all, this show is a must-watch."
2015-10-13,hemant-04366,extraordinary show,6,"if you are a series lover, and want to see exciting series which is filled with a lot of drama, romance, ego, conspiracy and what not, this show is seriously meant for you guys. the show is based on the lives of the people who are fighting for the throne,and, one who will sit on the throne will be the ruler of the seven kingdoms. this show is a historical fiction with supernatural happenings like the white walkers (the dead walking ice man) who are ready to kill, and even the dragons. the show is filled with a lot of good dialogues and the casting actors have played their role very well. this show i.e. game of thrones is a must watch show and will leave a lasting mark on your memory. hence, i strongly recommend all the viewer to at least give it a try and sink in its beauty. you won't regret!!!!"
2011-05-07,damlaozd,a new addiction,10,"i was waiting to be able to watch sean bean in something like this since the return of the king. now seeing him in such a great series as the protagonist is simply delightful.apart from the great acting and setting, i haven't watched a series with so many interesting characters for a long time. you are immediately engaged in their stories, hating the bad guys to their guts, and know the good ones won't have it very easy.in such a well,written story, every episode is watched like a movie. one week is too long to wait for the next one.i highly recommend this show."

2020-05-23,blackwarrior-15314,Don't listen to any 1/10 reviews,2,"any of those reviews will be from people spewing their anger over the fact that the ending wasn't what they wanted it to be, which to me is incredibly immature and childish. could the ending have been better? absolutely. the last two seasons are incredibly rushed, and as a result the conclusions don't have the clarity they should. however, if you think about it, the ending is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, and it certainly doesn't ruin the series. if anything it just proves that the journey is better than the end. the show as a whole is fantastic. it's just that the last two seasons weren't up to par with the rest because the source material from grrm wasn't there since the books are still being written. if you're willing to accept that going in, you'll definitely enjoy this show. one of the best fantasy tv series out there, you won't find better."
2019-05-13,ashorali,just okay episode that's it,7,of course not deserve rating like battle of bastrad and wind of winter....its like mountain and vibe mixed with black water and with al little emotions from red weding
2019-05-20,jc_gm,The fatal final season,9,"i don't understand how this magnificent history went to trash. the structure and argue of each conflict, character and possible future were destroyed in the last two season. i believe this course be in part for the rush of hbo looking only the business on this serie. i ask myself if the directors of the last season even read the books or watch the last season, i believe they didn't give the final that the history deserve, and that's why i am giving a pathetic six, and is six for the wonderful work done on the first five seasons."

2021-03-14,dmharn,Masterpiece From Beginning to the End!,1,"this is a fantastic story from the beginning until the end. the ending is perfect. it could not have been done any better. many people are swayed by internet nonsense but don't be foolish. this show nailed the landing. the last season will eventually go down as a masterpiece. the episodes were perfectly paced and exciting. if you were paying attention, dany's end was obvious from season 5 or before. great show! yes, i read the books, i'm just not a whiny, entitled moron."
2019-03-25,bhinton-83773,EXCELLENT First 4 seasons... but...,10,"this series had well written dialogue, unmatched world building, superb acting, deep complex characters. unfortunately it no longer has many of those things. the characters have fallen from deep and complex to extremely one demensional and uninteresting. jon snow in particular seemed to have lost his entire personality after his resurrection and is now incredibly bland. the deaths in the series now have no emotional weight like they used to. resurrecting a character destroys the weight of his/her death and the entire sequence just feels as if its begging for attention. other very bland characters: bran stark, sansa stark, arya stark the edgelord, ramsay bolton, even tyrion and littlefinger have gone way downhill. it saddens me that the show's quality dropped so far unlike other superior dramas. the series still has a beautiful world and unreal production quality, but the problem lies in the writing which is the foundation for a good series. the writers clearly don't know what they're doing and were previously being carried by martin. s1 9.5/10 s2 9.5/10 s3 9/10 s4 9/10 s5 6.5/10 s6 7.5/10 s7 6/10"
2019-05-13,l-47464,RIP last season,10,"rip got season 8 along many characters. to all the legendary seasons and episodes, last season did not do justice at all. infact, its the worst season of the most epic season of all time. producers: if you can remake season eight, that would be great."
2018-07-26,ptgn123,Nothing compared to the books.,10,acting is mediocre at best. personally i'd suggest just reading the books.
2019-06-06,redwingca,Final seasson thumbs down,10,"really liked seassons 1,7 , that final seasson 8 in my case two thumbs down"
2020-01-03,audiodevil,Overall a great made show but lack at the long waited battle,10,"1,4 seasons was great, the rest was building story to be great but we have no time or ideas to show it.. i'm sad to say that because it was a show i enjoyed waiting to watch but all those years of waiting went off in one episode at the end. clever plot i must say but i think some episodes made just to fill the gap."
2016-06-08,blackxpanda,Too much graphic full male nudity and only partial female nudity,10,"it's an excellent programme spoilt by spin and media attention. the recent episode with the graphic shot of the penis and scrotum reinforced the inequality of nudity in the production where all females hide behind merkins so there is no full female nudity. i would prefer no genital nudity as a production of this quality does not need it. the parents guide is currently incorrect and really needs to be corrected to:,partial female nudity only , all genitalia being either covered or cgi altered. full male nudity including close up graphic views of genitalia the current guide implies a lot of female nudity but only as much as you would see on a beach"
2016-07-03,iamashik,Best TV show ever!!,10,"the production scale,the sets, everything is so huge for a tv show and is becoming comparable to any multi million dollar hollywood movie. at first i thought of would be an ordinary fantasy series with some adult scenes forcefully pushed into it. but later on i started liking the plot twists ,the unexpected killings, the war scenes etc. the series is addictive and this is why it has gone on to become the most watched tv series in the world. the series is not for the faint hearted though as it contain many violent and torturing scenes.but overall it is more than fun to watch and keeps you guessing what is going to happen in upcoming episodes"
2019-06-07,jennifercasco,Stop watching after season 6,8,"i gave got a 6 because that's the last good season of the series. strong beginning, terrible ending."
2016-06-27,nikanorgrace,There is no better show on TV (at least Fantasy genre) than Game of Thrones.,10,"game of thrones is the type of show in which you watch the first few episodes, and you are bored. but if you continue, and watch a whole season. you will love the show with such an intense passion that only got viewers can love. with it's intense intrigue, mind blowing plot twists, amazing acting, great makeup, a huge budget. it literally is the show to impress. granted it may get a little every once in a while, but only for like a few minutes. every minute is gold, and it only has the fans wishing it had more than 10 episodes per season. a huge got fan myself.. i can testify to the authenticity of this masterpiece. not a show for children."
2018-02-11,nikanorgrace,There is no greater show than Game of Thrones!,8,"game of thrones isn't just a television show. no. it's a community, lifestyle, religion even. there are no flaws in this fantastic internationally acclaimed masterpiece! music, acting, dialogue, costumes, script, cinematography... the list goes on. a must watch for intelligent viewers who appreciate quality and smart television. go. now. and. begin. your. journey. of. game. of. thrones! become entranced in the world of westeros where betrayal, romance, murder, mystery, thriller, happiness, intelligence, nudity, fantastic plots, emotionally well done musical scores and just oscar worthy performances all takes place.10/10+ and highly recommend!"
2019-05-22,fatima-80556,NOTICE!!!,10,"i've enjoyed every minute watching game of thrones. each season has its outstanding moments and disappointing ones, people should remember that and stop rating the whole series 1/10 just because of a few episodes."
2020-06-29,yashsali,Could have been the best show ever,5,"the writers messed up.. i'll put it right there. it was a great show for the first 6 seasons. the best i'd say. but then the writers of the show thought, lets do something else and not follow the original books. yup, thats the moment they messed up. the quality declined in season 7 but it was still good. but then the final season was so bad and hard to watch, it felt like every character's story ended abruptly. it just didn't feel natural. i've rewatched the show so many times before season 7 was out. but with an ending like that it just feels like all these years of buildup was wasted"
2019-05-16,nuraab,Greatest TV show ever,10,i believe it's the greatest tv show has ever made..
2016-12-30,semlord90,"So compelling, it's addictive (in a good way :P)",9,"after watching the first episode, i was instantly hooked. game of thrones is one of those rare shows that has everything it needs to qualify as a spectacular television programme: good quality dialogue, intriguing characters, stunning cinematography, well, choreographed battle sequences and plot lines that have been crafted and developed with fastidious care. it is of the medieval-fantasy genre, which will surely appeal to fans of the lord of the rings trilogy and other such works. but it is more than this- it is able to weave elements of political drama with the fantasy, something that is most noticeable in the king's landing story-line. this provides a contrasting sense of realism that makes it more engaging. one of my only issues with the show is the overabundance of characters across the seasons, which has led to a lack of character development in certain characters, like stannis baratheon, whose story-line has continually bored me. such excess characters decrease screen-time for other more interesting ones like tyrion lannister, daenerys targaryen and jon snow, who have more to offer in terms of their emotionally rich journeys.other than that, game of thrones is a show that continues to grow as each season passes, and never fails to surprise, which only serves to increase the amount that viewers invest themselves in the characters. although it has been panned by some people for its 'gratuitous sex scenes' and 'excessive gore', personally i think it adds to the show's portrayal of a gritty and corrupt medieval world, wrought by chaos and destruction.overall, i would highly recommend game of thrones, particularly to those who enjoy medieval-fantasy and political dramas. it is totally worthy of all the hype that it has going for it :)."
2021-03-04,karolurbanski,Loved it,3,"and i liked the last season, including the ending. schocking! i know! the kahleesie burning down the capital and turning in to a murderous despot in the name of freeing the people, is the perfect conclusion to a story that depicts this glorious movement of freeing the slaves and returning the rightfull ruler to the throne, that implodes in to going mad with power, hate and vengefulness. i mean the guilty just have to be punished for their crimes and for their reluctance to follow the right queen.
it's a great depiction of every totalitarian regime that blighted the 20th century. it's as thyrion describes it in his cell in the final episode. he believed in her and that what she was doing was good, untill it became apparent that she was mesmerized by her own righteusness to believe that whatever she did was good, despite any objective proof that says otherwise. and john snows betrayal of his beloved queen showed how difficult it is to stand up for what is right and admit that one has been wrong and mislead by a crazy movement; including how costly it is to leave that movement to people that do. such people often loose everything but their freedome.
so the whole story is an extravagant reminder to not follow an ideology blindly, just because it promises freedome and justice at the start. you have to keep a level head and still weigh circumstances as they arrive and always be ready to reevaluate your treasured stance."

2019-11-06,stephen_watt,Decent but overrated,7,"reluctant to watch the program for a long time as dragons and fantasy were not to my taste but i thought sooner or later i would need to watch it so my opinion would be a valid one. if i'm being honest i switched it off a couple of times when it went stupid like when the fire died down and daenerys had cartoon dragons on her shoulder but i'm glad i stuck with it as it had some decent episodes that held it together but too many boring ones, it is no where near a 9.4 rating or even an 8.8 and people who are saying it is the best box set ever must not have seen many programmes or are very sad boring individuals as there are much better programmes out there that deserve to be watched before this."

2017-05-29,robertb-18710,It's like crack on television,10,"once you watch it, you can't stop. this show is the greatest show of them all. amazing plot and characters. you can't predict what's about to happen. the series is full of twist and turns. the cgi and scope of it is something unheard of in television. it's a 73 hour movie, that's what it is.great acting from everyone from the cast. but the best part of the show is not the action, battles or the violence. the best part is the amazing dialogues between characters and the all the well layered characters that live in this rich world of essos and westeros."
2019-04-23,luke-91947,Boring!,10,"sorry guys, i really try hard. but it's boring. i watched episode 1 and 2 of the first season and i found it very talkative and sleepy.
i push myself to watch the first episode of the latest season (8) and even if there were a couple of dragon to revive my interest, the feeling was the same: boring. the characters talk too much. this series, like the series lost, are soap opera in disguises."
2019-05-14,danieledsbyn,Hero to Zero,10,"one of the best tv,series of all time turned to one of the worst by bad writing in the last 2-3 seasons, the same time when the series surpassed the books.a such complex tree of character storyline can't end in any other way than disaster if you rush the end. and that's what happens to this show. it is like the series went for a nice and slow walk in terms of tempo the first 5-6 seasons and then turned it to a 100 meter sprint. character development down the drain.i do recommend watching with a warning of disappointment. the first seasons are like nothing else after all."

2017-10-07,claudiasl,Zero stars!!,7,"what happened to the writers on season 7!!?? the show went from being one of the greatest to one of the worst in one season. we were used to a story that was coherent, and credible (as science fiction can be). that is, the fantasy world had rules and the story followed such rules (like there is no time travel nor teleportation). dialogues were coherent and smart, full of meaning and intention, and characters had well rounded personalities and were credible as flawed human beings. all that is gone in season 7. nothing makes sense. decisions are totally out of character, the storyline is full of flaws and inconsistencies, the dialogues are dumb and boring. i wanted to give some examples, but i am afraid that i would just describe all the episodes one by one. they are all terrible! it is a shame. hbo writers have really proved that they are nothing without the books. seriously, have some dignity and quit your job. you've ruined one of the greatest tv series. shame! shame! shame!"

now all the cast and the characters live in 1 place and at the same timeline. the dialogue and story leaves nothing for the imagination... we are being spoon fed that's why we hate season 8. it's a hard sale anyway you see it.
i give 10 stars because of emilia clark in the bell episode.
she saves it with epic masterfull acting. those 8 seconds while she sits on her dragon (wooden apparatus facing a green screen) and decide to burn the city « à la » the mad king... that moment she decide to be a dragon and the mad queen and burn the city like her dad wanted ages ago.
wow!
she earns her $500k times 8 for season 8!"
2021-02-07,lawstudent-3,Good series - appreciate the quality that went into it.,9,"really loved this series.it's still visually stunning, the music is still breathtaking and the production quality overall is just mindblowing , except when it comes to writing. 7 seasons if storyline were butchered, including the main villain and basically all of the main characters. it wasn't a factor of me not agreeing or me not being 'happy' about it - they literally destroyed their storlyines and made them act like different people whilst all they, and therefore we had gone through, meant nothing. it's been extremely painful to see such decline in what was genuinely the best thing to grace television. i truly believe that.i'll still give it a 7. the first few seasons are without a doubt the best you'll ever see. but if you missed out or come across this in 10 years time when the next generation will find out about this phenomenon: know that the ending and the whole last season are an utter disappointment an ruin it all."
2019-05-16,battalalrawqi,The best show ever,1,"best series ever, the best show in history, perfect story, good actors, the best soundtrack ever, everything is epic but season 8 is disappointed"
2019-05-16,peseng,Wonderful,1,game of thrones is one of the best serials over time.
2019-05-22,peseng,Game of thronse,9,nice show and good ending. dont care about what people say about last episode.
2020-01-19,hartigan-45074,Most disturbing show I've seen,10,started with the first season and i really pushed myself to like the show and press the button to watch the next episodes. anyway the names the tribes etc make you lose control of what's really going on. the hype people got for this show is really strange. i didn't like anything about it and i'm a fan of lord of the rings. the plot is quite complex everybody trynna kill each other and a lot of nudes for no reason at all. nude is used in series to appeal specific audience and thats not my thing. the landscapes were pretty cool though.
2021-08-30,vancebcunningham,So I just binged the show in 2 weeks,9,"well, not entireiy watched season 1 a few years ago and hated it, i was/am a massive lord of the rings fan and killing off the only true good character at the end didn't make me want to see any more. i slogged through season 2 after losing a bet with a friend, then made it to blackwater. after that episode, i watched the entire show, pretty much all day and into the night for several days. seasons 3, 4, and 6 were great, 7 was by far the worst, and i didn't think season 8 was that bad (i thought the bells was a great episode) but the finale was truly awful. i honestly think if they had done everything else but put jon on the throne instead of bran, people wouldn't have been so upset. but that one decision killed 10 years of fandom and any rewatch value. anyways, just my thoughts. i started the first book, glad to be a new member of the community."
2018-04-05,charlierodgers,Unbelievable Jeff,8,"what a show u literally just can't write this stuff. action packed from the beginning to the end, characters that will build relationships with u like nether before and episodes with mind bending endings will keep u guessing. the best ever show imo"
2019-09-10,rikhavvora199,A binge worthy show,8,some may like the ending many may not but it's the journey that matters and it was absolutely awesome
2020-01-01,f-emad-56752,A new and unpopular view after seeing it again,9,"game of thrones was according to me not an ordinary series, but a legendary series in writing, directing and acting, really it is a wonderful series, but let's consider some of the things in the recent fail of the legendary performance of the series, which are the following 1) the speed of events and the lack of considering the action and the reaction, which made the last season uneven and messy
2) failure to interpret the decisions of some of the characters, which may be irrational and inappropriate after the growth of the character and everything that it has experienced
3) error of montage like seeing starbucks cup and some things like that are really unprofessional and not attributed to the professionalism of the seriesexcept for that, to me game of thrones won the throne for the best production series and a dramatic plot, cgi effect 10/10"
2019-08-08,kallanclarke,A Turned Head,10,"i'm not usually the one for medieval based movies or shows, but game of thrones totally changed my perspective of the genre. flawless! yeah the series finale may have disappointed a lot of people but it will never be enough to alter my opinion of the entire show."
2019-04-10,turtles-81568,Over hyped,9,i believe there are still many flaws with this series. like how many before it just was full of blood and gore overshadows any deep storylines
2019-05-16,mevs-31952,Episode series excellent and integrated,10,"the episode was excellent by way of supplementing the story and cheating on the characters such as the hound, sircy and jamie were legendary of filming and directing music"
2019-05-16,mevs-31952,Legendary,10,legendary and epic series integrated story and integrated events worth 10/10
2020-12-24,qavqaz,An all time classic,1,"one of the best tv shows ever even with a disappointing last season. it became the victim of it's own success, so there will be no satisfying end to conclude. it is not a mere tv show but a cultural phenomenon. there will be none other, i believe."
2019-05-21,mosk-80267,The best,7,"the best show ever. weth out the last season.
thanks for your efforts."
2019-05-27,mosk-80267,The best show ever,6,i love the showthe best show ever ever ever thanks for your time
2020-04-19,sayoojjeevan,I am writing this review after 2 years since the series finale and still its in the top 5 of the trending list,10,"will be the best ...then now & forever pls dont judge it with last few episodes
because the first was more than what we think.... as it goes we became familiar to what it is and what it will be and the at the end ... all was the same ...."
2018-07-28,joseph_oueiss,Amazing!,1,"it will keep you locked to your screen, you can't miss a second of the show as every moment has its meaning. the events are unpredictable which leaves you sometimes in shock but you can't have enough of it."
2019-05-20,curiousturk,One of the best TV series of all times,8,"although i believe the last season was rushed and was full of easy, unsophisticated script, editing and story telling. yet overall, i still believe that you need to see this series.after the book ends, unfortunatelty it is true that the character development and the story telling gets too simple that the quality goes down where the producers of the series try to compansate what is lacking in the story with the special effects,it was just too much to digest and it didn't feel natural, sorry... the whole reason you are not getting 10 out of 10 is the final season,.. cinematography: 20 out of ten fo sure for season 8. but for writing, i would give three out of ten."
2019-05-16,abdalah-19047,No comment,10,really no comment this show no way see like this. the best
2019-09-05,keshavmohadeb,Okay that was heartbreaking,10,theres my rating. only a solid 6 for the first 6 seasons. 7 wasnt that bad but 8 ruined it from top to bottom. it made me so angry and sad.
2019-05-15,saudbishi-25475,Most powerful series in history,10,"this is like the great show i've ever watch, everything is just perfect , writing and story and actors , if you didn't wathed it yet , i hardly advise you to watch it right now"
2020-08-30,arcanebound,"Epic Take Off , Horrifically Terrible Conclusion",10,"the series basically checks all the boxes of what you want in a great story set during medieval times. it has fantasy elements, political and sexual intrigue, good character arcs, very little plot armor, mystery, complex setting and great world building... most of which goes out the window during the last 1,2 seasons.regardless of how great the series was until the producers ran out of material to draw from (because martin hadn't completed the books yet), the tale they themselves wrote as the conclusion to this masterpiece is horrendous enough to negate any enjoyment and shatter all expectations (in a negative way) you might gain from the first seasons.in short, watch until half of season 6 and then look for where to start on the books.i don't know what the producers were thinking when they were writing the conclusion, but what they did is more akin to ""bending reality itself"" than actually continuing the story in a logical fashion. the amount of dead ends in character arcs, nonsensical decisions by supposedly cunning, smart characters, the character assassination of a lot of the cast etc. is a magnificent mess to witness."
2019-05-19,alaa_biology,Best,10,"best series ever even with seasons 7 and 8 no series like it
i'm sad because got could be better but still the best"
2019-05-16,mshmsh-bmw,GTO,10,"got, a very wonderful series from the beginning and his thought is beautiful in the establishment of characters, which is very wonderful in the first 7 seasons."
2019-02-04,ankitkhera-46168,Most overrated show of our time,10,"i watched this show recently after hearing people praising it for the last 5,6 years but i can honestly say now that it is a really bad show built on an immoral society and showing their lust for power. only narcissistic personalities can write, watch and praise this show. western civilization has been a curse to the mankind since the start and all they care about is cut each other's throat or make them kneel by accepting their culture and religion. i have never even heard about a single moral ruler from the west. shame on the creator and shame on the viewers for praising this nonsense instead of watching ideal king rule like in ramayana or ideal justice like in mahabharata."
2021-01-14,krishnacarolina,Disappointed,10,"game of thrones.. is the worst tv series ending in the history..you bring a big story, characters,roles,dragons and ed sheeran so on.. but you just finished it with the dragon breathing fire .. what was on the director mind.. i think vince gilligan should have taken a short note and he would saved the series.. such a disappointed tv seriesof all time ..as r.r.martin said it should have more season as by the books.. whatever going back to walter white is the best way to calm my self for this fup series..."
2019-03-14,jsric-01173,This is it...so far...,10,"the best tv series ever...almost perfect except for the timing, the gaps between seasons it was just too long and the episodes just not enough..ha ha ha guess i'm just a sucker...just have to deduct a star because of it. no comparison (it is the best tv series ever produce), just wish they make like 3,hour of 3 part movies like the lord of the rings in imax, that would be awesome. but then again, it is based on the book which may loose a lot of elements to it. people who compare this to the story of ramayana and mahabharata should be ignore. as i have mentioned before...this is a fiction not even a myth, after all, this is from a novel. it has got nothing to do with history and civilization. please, be an educated adult, enjoy the series and stop calling on others and make comparison."
2018-11-17,malunacrec,GOAT on TV,1,"what can i say that haven't been said before? this is s fantastic show! i have read all the books ( waiting for the last two), and i have seen all seasons multiple times!this show has everything! it will definitely get you in touch with every emotions tapped it untapped! you will actually find how hypocritically dark you are rooting for murder, betrayal, and incestous relationship! i will miss this show once the last season is over."
2019-08-04,afaanrocks,Fantastic!!Confusing!!HATED the ending!!,6,i say that it is the best series i have ever seen till this date! the characters and the storyline is so damn gooooood! but it is also a bit confusing though. i had to browse the internet to get some answers related to some specific questions and doubts i had in my mind. this tv series does not give all the answers to those audience who have not gone through the novel. and the ending was quite disspointing. we the viewers were expecting a very different ending in my opinion. the ending was not satisfying in my case. and mostly it made me really sad that this show has finished.
2019-03-03,emiliaandreou,Best series I have ever seen,1,i cannot emphasise enough how much i love this show. it's amazing and unlike any other.
2019-01-20,dossgaming,Best tv serie ever?,1,"so game of thrones has completely changed the way how the tv series should follow. the best seasons in my opinion are the 6th season and the 7th
things i didn't like it: that one thing i really didn't like it it's some details that the show didn't give us an enough details like the character of benjin stark we did not know what's happened with him beyond the wall except thatthe show is the best tv series i ever saw and i don't think we'll get something like this
finally i hope that the final season will be the best thing we ever see."
2019-05-12,dossgaming,People who rate this 1 the episode doesn't release yet so how the hell you put this rate grow up man it's ashow to enjoy not to search evry single fault,1,all hopes to save this season are in this 2 last episodes so i hipe it will be good and we'll get a sad ending that's all i hope
2019-05-12,dossgaming,Best show ever,3,this is the best show in history whatever they rate it it was and still an it will stay in the throne of tv shows and if u don't like this season on don't rate it 1 or 2 in the end it's a tv show it is to enjoy it not to search evry single fault common guys
2019-06-01,catmog,I live Game of Thrones,4,i am an absolute fan of this series and it was an agonising wait for the final bunch of episodes to start. the beginning of the season it was great but to be honest it hasn't gone the way i thought it would have. i did feel quite a bit cheated that after all the terrible and malicious things cersei has done to people she ended up being killed by a brick wall falling on her. how disappointing
2019-05-27,ibrakf,Greatest show ever,6,"game of thrones is the greatest show in history, its a masterpiece!"

2019-06-04,sonykaos,"Watch till Season 4, after that is becomes Hollywood Bullcrap",8,"db weiss and david bienoff made a good show of the books, but after the disney deal was made to direct the next star wars movie, greed kicks in and they screwed the last two seasons. the last two seasons, don't make sense, bad characters, bad dialog, cringe moments. all in all, a shame to the the fans of the books and the series. you have one shot to make it right the first time, and they decide to shorten everything just for their next career step.iam disgusted and disappointed."
2019-02-27,jasmiefarralley,Sorry to say i'm Over it,10,"i've had a real love hate relationship with this show. there are a few seasons in the middle i just don't remember. it gives the illusion of lots happening, but little actually does.looking forward to the last season but also happy that it is the last. which makes me a bit sad, but most people loved it so that's cool. each to their own, i always say."
2019-05-21,rowlyrowl,4 out of 10,6,just remake the final battle where the night king wins and destroys the earth.
2019-05-20,matarkalhosani,This is a good show but sometimes things goes wrong of bad,5,we all should see the good side of the show as all of the characters you can't see what the hard work that they are doing but cause you don't like what happens you say that you hate the show.
2019-05-20,aadriansimmons,Five Great Seasons...Two Great Seasons...and an awful ending,1,"i highly recommend you avoid this show given how bad the ending was. it literally ruined the series if you're a dany fan. if you don't care about dany at all, then by all means watch on. if you care about dany and all she went through, then avoid this show. they destroy her character in the final two episodes and make her entire journey worthless and pointless.dany fans, you have been warned."
2019-03-27,justagenius,The best series I've watched,9,"this is the best series i've ever watched, and i watch a lot of them. the characters, the politics, the hidden messages, everything is perfect. normally fighting scenes are special and cool in series, but with got everything is perfect. not saying the battle scenes aren't cool, because they're amazingly well shot and thought out aswell. i really wonder what season 8 is going to be like and how everything is going to play out. can't wait!"
2019-05-20,jcfbarclay,The show that has made history in TV,7,game of thrones has is certainly the tv show you recommend to your friend or someone you know. this show captures every emotion and puts it in a way that can always shock and leave you amazed by what happens. the amount of time spent to make these episodes is amazing and should appreciated to all viewers of great tv shows like got.

2020-08-30,danielcraig-58813,The Best Show Ever Made,10,"got is literally the best show ever made. it has every thing a user can ask for love,hate,resentment,anger,care,affection,etc and all these emotions are expressed so perfectly that you are bound to fall in love with the show. the character development is soo effective yet soo subtle you'll never realize when you started to love the character whom you hated and wanted dead earlier.people may have their issues with the last season but according to me it was the only ending which made sense and which was'nt biased to a particular side. i think got deserves better and understanding fans."

2019-05-02,gfso_franca,One episode can destroy a great story,8,"i loved got, but after season 8 episode 3, it just felt like a waste of time. the writers simply destroyed all the narrative of the series in a single episode.
they subverted my expectations, but not in a good way.
until the ending of season 6 is great.
season 7 starts the writing problems.
season 8 begins with two good episodes and then butcher all the story."

2019-05-13,ragnarlordbrok,Old time fan,8,"used to be heavily into this series. when season 1 came on tv and i caught notice of it i bought all the books and have since been heavily into the lore. sadly the two last seasons have completly ruined this series for me.the writing is horrible and it really shows that d&d are nothing but frauds, as soon as they ran out of book material the show went south fast! i'd love to rate it higher but season 8 is possible the worst that have been sent on tv in recent history (and i used to watch the walking dead...)."

2019-05-20,robinmitcham,"""SHAME... SHAME... SHAME...""",8,"one of the finest tv shows ever, ruined by one of the worst endings in tv history. 1,7 are a exceptional & a masterpiece in tv but 8 has worse imagination & writing than a low grade soap. this would've been a 10 if it wasn't for season 8 & i'm struggling to give it a 9."
2019-05-11,brianapeyton,"Was great, not anymore",10,"season 1,6 are some of the best season of tv i've watched, would give it a 10. season 7 went way downhill as they tried to make too much happen too fast, would give it an 7.5. season 8 sucks, would give it a 5. if i hadn't invested years in the show i'd stop watching"
2019-05-14,brianapeyton,Season 7 and 8 ruined the series,10,"season 1,6 were easily 10s, best series i've ever watched. season 7 was way to sped up and they lost the magic that was game if thrones, i'd give it a 7. season 8 is down right terrible, i'd give it a 4 or t. spoilers. for how great this series was this was the worst ending imaginable. bad dialogue, no explanations, far fewer conspiracies in a back room, and every main character is invincible vs the other soldiers who die immediately. great war was everything but. the last war was garbage. can't wait for martin to finish the series so i can see how it really ends cause this isn't it."
2019-10-08,aryanvaradpande,Season 8 ep 4 and 5 was worst but reast was awsome,10,"even last episode was thoughtful they made us believe that now everything has finished and now got has ended i literally cried and was not able to sleep for 4,5 days"

2019-05-16,mohdmak-01035,THE BEST SHOE EVER,10,"the most amazing series in history. acting, writing, graphic everything is graet"
2019-05-13,juliacreuter,Fantastic movie-like work of art!,10,"in my opinion the user behaviour on this series 8th episode is childish and disgusting! so i finally registered with imbd to say so.yes, there are weaknesses in terms of story telling. but nobody is obviously willing to think first, why this is so. they rather pre,rate episodes badly by the thousands rather than wait and see and appreciate for what is there, rather than which of their fantasies was mot fulfilled.there has never been such an amazing and budget-intense series in tv history, so money had to be cut in some sense, unless all who moan around here would have been willing to sponsor out of their pockets.each episode of season 8 has been monumental, like a hollywood movie in itself. so, yes, some story telling was left out. some dialogues could have been extended. this ir that could have been done differently. but it wasn´t because the makers decide on their story and budget. live with it and stop the whining!fantastic series. i am really sad we are facing the final."
2019-05-21,luciavogue,only for season 8,10,"why i think this is worst ever written season. 1) we thought ultimate battle will be between most strongest night king who built a huge army in 1000 yrs vs all of the human kingdoms best warriors.
but lost the interest in the show after knowing he is killed right in 3rd episode so easily.
2) showing queen cersei as a bigger threat as compared to knight king is totally pathetic. when dany says we won the great war now we will win the last war. i am totally bored with chronological order , i suddenly lost the interest in the show because most anticipated great war already over now what action is there left to be presumed.
3) dany's character is built from the start of the show as merciful, kind, humble, just person. and suddenly shockingly the stupid directors of the show wants to trash all the 7 season homework around dany to make her biggest villian just because they made mistake by finishing their super villian knight king right at the beginning of the season.
4) their is no consistency of dragon capabilities.
whole show in all previous seasons they depict dragons as the ultimate weapon against cold night king. and when dragon uses full throw of fire it wont melt a drop out of night king but the dead dragon's blue flame is shown breaking wall magic and making it melt.
another scene jon snow hides behind rock which blue flame of dead dragon cant break or melt.
but when last battle start dragon melt down a wall 10 ft thick so easily.
5) arya had a chance to avenge her father and kill cersei which was number 1 name on her list but instead she fleds the scene so easily. she trained full season 5 for this task and she didnt do it. totally crap.
6) sansa stark who is a coward greedy for throne from the starting of the show gets an independent kingdom so easily when she cant even wield a knife where as arya who is trained fighter spy gets nothing at all. and three eyed raven cant see who is right or wrong person to be queen.
7) dany is killed, dragon, dothraki and unsullied does nothing to avenge her. rather just arrest jon snow where in previous season they clearly show how these people do instant ruthless justice by killing intantly.
8) cersei is given a farewell as a lover and just queen, who was shown as an evil ruler and cheater in relationship right from start until last season."
2019-05-13,uberwatcher,The show is ruined,10,horrible writing in season 8 ruined the show. i feel bad for grrm who had such good writing but d&d managed to screw it up.

2019-05-14,thiyagesprince,NOT TODAY - ARYA STARK,9,"this show is a must to watch. despite the negative review given by so called ""fans"" are not true, it is actually based on our point of view. as a fan since 2011, i love this show very much till the end. now we are the end of the show, eagerly waiting for the last episode of game of thrones. but at the same time, i don't want this show to end, once you have watched it, you'll feel the same (you'll hope of spin off)the character development from season 1 to season 8 is extraordinary. try binge watching it! you will really be into it in few weeks. believe me :'). too many unexpected deaths, makes you cry more than you know. overall, best tv series i have ever watched!"

2019-05-19,leenalmalafekh,Why i loved the episode,2,it took us back to the game of thrones we are used to and the dragon queen kind of always had a mad side and due to the circumstances i don't blame her for burning them

2019-05-23,barry-paterson,"""A Good Story Isn't a Good Story if You Have a Bad Ending""",10,"game of thrones was one of those shows that soared above all others in every aspect. the storyline was rich and complex, the characters were unique and it was very easy to become addicted to reading about the many theories and prophecies.i recommended game of thrones to multiple friends and family, adamant that it was the greatest thing to ever be shown on television , which it was. until its final season, at least. (the 7th had its moments too but most of it was excusable).saying ""there will always be people that weren't going to like the way it ended"" or ""people are upset just because it was ending"" is true, only to an extent. however, to completely disregard the backlash the ending has received for these reasons alone, is obviously being in denial. if some don't like it, fine. if the majority don't like it, then it's not good.the ending was an incredible let-down. one that hits harder than most because the show was almost flawless for multiple seasons. it's like the writers stopped putting any thought into the events leading up to the end. we aren't upset that it wasn't a ""fairytale ending"" or our favourite characters didn't end up where we wanted them. we're disappointed because of the multiple plot-holes, destroyed character development, illogical scenarios, unanswered questions and the fact that multiple prophecies and characters seemed to vanish into thin air. to top this off, it became very hard to decipher how much time had passed on the show - leading to scenes with little to no logic and characters making questionable decisions. despite this, the cast and production teams done an amazing job. the acting was always top-notch and everyone gave it their all, which they should be proud of.""a good story isn't a good story if you have a bad ending"" - this was mentioned during an interview with the shows creators and it's something i wholeheartedly agree with. the show begins as one of the greatest to grace our televisions but ends as one of the worst. this is why i've decided to give game of thrones 1/10 stars. once you watch the final season, any desire to rewatch the show will quickly fade. it will feel like someone has put a knife to your heart and uttered the words ""for the watch""."
2019-06-05,mpopescuu,great 5 6 seasons...a total disaster 8 season,10,"what i have to say many have said before me and i agree that it was a great serie that ended in total disaster ...i learned that in life win not those that fight for an idea or have a great goal like saving humankind ...but those that live to kill the survivors...or just sit and watch..totally garbage...or that even between brothers.... brother and sister...one can t rule over another...another garbage...we learn that a man can kill a woman he loves and that loves him because a soeone just asks him to do it...and he just agrees on it... john snow becomes a human being worst then a zombie...he may just kill anyone if someone asks him to do it...?i didn t understand why he cried while killing daenerys while she was kissing him...he s just a puppet... i understand that salsa litterally did nothin an entire season and ended being a queen...i uderstand a war can end if their commander is killed...just like that ... it doesn t matter if everyone know the killer...nothing to learn from this season...just garbage that add nothing to values of life ... just emptiness...finally i m dissapointed by some actors that turned on fans seeing their dissapointment on a 6 episodes season...
so... i didn t understand why some actors had to react on fans reviews and rage and use some words that should not be used by an actor ... and that dissapointed me even more...it s not the first good thing in life that ended garbage...good bye hbo"
2019-05-20,christian_till-42095,Going to have to do this due to how you runied the ending.,10,ffs..... this is a joke. where is the rest of it? what happened to the dothraki? what happened to the unsullied? whhhhyyy???
2020-04-17,umarabbah,Worst ending to a show ever in history of TV,10,such a disgraceful conclusion for what used to be a great show. huge let down. talking about it just makes me mad because i had so much love for this show.
2019-08-13,alexmukaddam,Very disappointing finale,10,"i was quite disappointed in the final seasons story line and the abundance of loose ends. i have since moved onto a much better series called ertugrul, if you are or were a got fan you sure to enjoy this sublime series"
2019-05-23,obaidharthi,Obaidharthi,10,the level was not appropriate for this series live me the best 7 seasons to destroy everything in one season
2019-05-23,zelabelle,Great! Except for the final season..,6,this show started out strong. then the final season happened... the writers clearly had no idea about the characters or the lore of their own show. everything has been great about this show except for the terrible final season. its nobody's fault but the writers: they underestimated the intelligence of the viewers in a way that's simply insulting and they clearly just wanted to end what should have been an epic tale. what was the point of watching the previous 7 seasons if this is where it leads? don't waste your time.
2019-05-24,nemo-90066,Completely fizzled out...,10,started excellently and got better but completely baffled by the final season. so much time and effort put into creating and building interesting and exciting characters only to see their stories end in the most unimaginable ways. if you've not watched game of thrones i would definitely recommend it but be prepared to be somewhat confused by the lackluster ending.
2019-08-21,seanwallacesw,Game of Thrones,9,best series ever watched it so many times cant get enough of it thanks for making the best series ever
2019-05-26,tweaknhoe,Why just why? This show could have been the best ever.,10,"the end ruined it all for me. it reminds me of lost, you can't judge it anymore without thinking of the ending and i wouldn't recommend it to my friends knowing how bad they handled it in the end. wow just, wow i don't regret the ride, but i have never seen such a good show fall apart like this. i guess the checks have been cashed who cares about artistic integrity"
2019-05-27,arbaazs-35532,There won't be anything like this show,10,what a wonderful series it is. i have never watched anything like got before. the way it is directed and the cast is amazing. i'm watching all the seasons again. just loved it
2019-05-30,gmagius,Maybe the best TV show with the worst final season ever,3,"i'll be short: season 1,5 : vote 10
season 6 : vote 8
season 7 : vote 5
season 8 : vote 2without martin books, last 3 seasons started the descent into the abyss.
poor screenplay, awful dialogues, plot armors, plot holes, all characters have a regression, internal inconsistencies, incompetence in military matters.
disrespectful to the public and the author.
i bet the actors will show their disappointment in the future.
i really don't know if i'd recommend it"
2019-06-02,johnphilps,Mixed review for a mixed up series,10,"it's been said before but game of thrones is outstanding... that is for the first four series and part of the fifth.if you have not seen this series ever, a quick word of warning! unless you enjoy watching programs that are so powerfully portrayed that they become a passion only to then have it all torn away in a rushed and totally disappointing series finale then game of thrones is the series for you.i honestly could not enjoy the first five series anymore, i was truly passionate about it and devoted weeks to the program, i read the books and purchased the merchandise and now i wish i hadn't of bothered.the worst is that the characters that i had spent eight years getting to know became caricatures of themselves.the cast is fantastic, it's truly acted well, the production was fantastic if a little poor with its use of cgi towards the final series but unfortunately this is a series that was plagued with poor writers (d&d) that seem that they could not escape fast enough.series eight is abismal. anyone who hasn't seen it i would warn away, if you need to then act as if series 5 was the finale, otherwise the outcome will just make you angry"
2019-06-02,saki-45400,Weird end,10,"serial have weird end,,if will be more seasons i will not watch it"
2021-01-13,rozhchalakr,It was the greatest show ever until season 7,10,"if it wasn't that ending , it would be the best show ever , unfortunately it's not now cuz of the terrible season 8 ( and some of season 7 ) everything was perfect ( dialogue, story, music, acting, cgi, visual,.... ) but in season 7 and 8 ( story, character art, light in the long night) were really bad
there were too many mistakes in both season
i hope it has ended like the lord of the ringsthe best tv show ever ended with the worst ending ever"
2020-06-23,kellyrobertson-62619,ABSOLUTELY LIVED THIS UP TILL SEASON 8 WHERE THEY DESTROYED IT,10,this was such a fantastic show until season 8. they totally annihilated it and napalmed the targarian queens everything in the final season that made me hate everything they did. kit harrington's character was blown in the end as well and let's just say i really didn't like where they were going with sansas character neither. between the destruction of the characters and the excessively dark imagery from directors claiming they were aiming for a natural look when they shouldve made it so people could actually see it....soooo very disappointed in how they left it!
2021-09-24,adilimtiazcheema,Simply because I can't give 100 out of ten,9,"i watched al seasons, but i don't know how to get myself out from the story.amazing."
2020-07-16,sushantsamrath,Winter is coming,10,just completed got in single shot it took 90hrs to complete whole series without sleeping. i always judge people who take reference from got. but now i understand what's the reason. must watch series👍🏻👍🏻
2019-06-28,johnpraseedom,Still one of the all time greatest tv show,10,last season was a huge disappointment. but still a must watch.
2019-07-08,antoinejeansebastienbousquet,Great start... Horrible ending,8,"the show is great until season 5, when the writers of the show ran out of materials from the books and started to improvise. season 7 started to become silly, with ridiculous plotholes but season 8 is simply terrible.the last seasons suffer from the ""hollywood syndrome"": spend all the budget on cgi and extras, and just give the direction and writing to someone that belong to the same tribe as the producers, no matter how incompetent they may be."
2019-10-11,aaronbowker,Ending wasn't great,10,was amazing until the last season where things became abit rushed
2019-06-20,pereubu2000,"Turgid, sophomoric pablum",10,"five, maybe ten years from now, people will try and watch this series and think to themselves about the public mania for this dreadful tripe, ""what drugs were the viewers on?"" and ""couldn't they afford better ones?"" many good actors gave their best, and many more mediocre actors chewed the scenery to no effect, but really, this is pretty silly stuff. tried to watch many times, every time turning away from it with one thought: is this a rejected monty python film?"
2019-07-13,ringleadr-09262,The Gretsat Tv shwo ever,1,the gretsat tv shwo ever is got and the characters in this shwo die like a fly
2021-08-08,dragonslayer99,Could have been a masterpiece,10,"for the first 4 seasons, this was the best series ever made in my opinion, even better than the sopranos and the wire. sadly, seasons 5, 7 and 8 ruined it, with s6 being just ""ok"" but still leagues below the first 4.it's really painful to see the decline of such an amazing show, hopefully we'll get another adaptation in the future, once the book series is actually finished (if it ever finishes)."
2019-10-06,fahadalsals,The best show in the history,10,the best show in the history 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍👌 i will see it again
2019-10-02,larasmolek,Magnificent series !!,8,"i started watching right when season 1 come out. i loved watching every new episode. because i live in europe, i waited until 3 am to watch the episode as soon as it come out. the actors delighted me with their acting skills. before each new season, i would look at all the previous ones one more time. i enjoyed the anticipation of new seasons.
i'll never forget my first shock when ned stark was killed. i will not forget the delight when joffrey was poisoned. happiness with which i saw daenerys slowly conquering the world. when jon snow was killed, i thought i would not continue watching, as sad as i was.
i definitely recommend the series to those who haven't watched it yet. i don't know what you've been waiting for so far? you missed the best series of all time! i think i'll start all over again soon ... let me be surprised again because there are so many things that i forgot so much already.
tension, anticipation and constant excitement are the characteristics of this series."
2019-10-19,rcnd15,best show evva!!!,10,"dear fans, there are hundreds of review materails on internet explaining why and how poor writing ruined the show. and all you can say in response is ""greatest show ever! if you don't like it, go watch something else!""
okay, here we people who say the wrting was poor go watch something else and you guys better go read the books. after understanding how writers wasted the concept, character building and history of asoiaf series, you're wellcome tell season 7 and season 8, (even some pisodes of season 6) ruined the show."
2019-11-13,suprajaiyer-21109,Best series forever and ever,1,bestttt and the first series i have ever watched. such best plot lines and filled with lots of susoense and i got so emotionally attached to the characters. i feel really sad i'm not listening to those outstanding got musics anymore. the series is purely love.
2021-06-14,suprajaiyer-21109,Woooowww!!! What a great series. EPISODE 8 isn't a SPOILER!!! It's worthy for people who accept different kinds of endings for a story.,8,"this was my first series to watch ever, i had downloaded it but didn't watch because it kinda looked like old boring wars but mannn! seriously it was one hell of a ride. the character developments, the animations, the story line, the families, the bond, the love, the revenge, the dragons, the night king, hallelujah!never boring i almost lost my eye sight watching it continuously , so addictive for me and believe me episode 8 isn't a spoiler to me it was different but no one liked the way it turned out into. but we always don't get what we want and what is expected ,if we get the same thing, it would have been more worst. this was great someway or the other."
2020-04-28,bluesready,He who lives by the sword...does not go out with a Bollywood dance number,9,"this one of a kind giga,production is the result of a lot of hard working, talented people. it's rather amazing that such a hoard was able to maintain such a high level of quality for so many years, providing us all with grans entertainment.some complain about the ending but how else could it have been? if good had wiped out evil and everyone had kissed, sung a song together and danced in perfect sync, all of the great work that preceded the conclusion would been depleted of any credibility.the characters of game of thrones inhabited a brutal and cynical world that chewed up and spit out the soft and the naive.this ending rings true to its own world and the epic tale that unfolded within it.a ""happy ever after"" ending would have been the greatest disappointment of all."
2020-07-01,usmanre,Need a Time machine from Dark Series to Watch the series again.,10,"no more comments on season 8. till season7 no more series will compete with got.stunning visuals, epic performance & terrific character development.personally am not considering negative on season 8.
other than season8 got always classy and worth watchable.
masterpiece forever"
2019-11-23,stefankonlechner,1-6(7) 10 stars. Season 8 0 stars,10,"one of the best shows ever made. one of the worst season endings ever made.i dont understand why the writters decided in the end to destroy the show. it was obvious that it wasnt possible to end this story in one season. they didnt care in the end. i dont understand why they didnt choose other writers to end the story in a way it deserved.
actors fine, animation fine... just a very crap and not meaningful story...i loved this show....like many others.
now im glad my ""watch"" as ended"
2020-07-19,balajinadar,JUST WATCH,7,just stick till red wedding. this show takes time to build each and every character but it's the best part about the show. every character will be your favourite by the end of show. it was slow pace in initial few seasons but once it paces up it is amazing and gripping each and every episode and you will end up this show finishing in the month. if possible save this show for last because this show will set a benchmark and you will keep comparing with others. ending is controversial so keep it aside and just start watching. pro tip while watching never ever search about next episode or next season internet is filled with spoilers.
2020-01-02,felixturner-27512,Just disappointing.,9,"if it were to end at season 5/6, then i couldn't fault it, easily a 10, but for such a brilliant series it was so horribly saddening to have it end in such an awful manner. 6/7 were excusable but by the time it came to end its was like the directors n writers had given up. sluggish, boring and predictable. storylines created that were never followed simply led to a dismal finale of an otherwise brilliant tv series. worth the watch but don't expect a finale to match the rest of it."
2020-01-26,thesblogenquiries,Let's pretend last season doesn't exist.,3,"season 1 to season 6 were amazing . great storyline , good plot and sub plot , great dialogues and amazing character arcs. season 7 was okay , but not as good as the other seasons. d&d ruined littlefinger , dany , tryion , lord varys . the ending wasn't justified at all. it almost 6 seasons for dany to become powerful and then she 'suddenly' becomes 'mad queen'. how is that possible ? the dialogues earlier were amazing, but the dialogues in season 8 sucked . out of the blue moon , littlefinger gets stupid , varys gets stupider , dany gets mad & tryion who back in season 1 talked about wearing your shortcomings as an armour , and in season 8 he 'bullies' the eunuch for being an eunuch. what kind of character development is that ? furthermore, the season 8 was rushed. 6 episodes ? seriously ? the audacity !"
2021-07-16,ricardomongiat,HERE IT IS...,9,"the final just ruined the entire show for me, its a shame."
2020-02-29,sonofth3sun,Game Of Pandering.,10,"people love this show, and i understand why. this show pretends to take the viewer seriously by having loads of ""deep"" dialogue. it's fantasy, it's blood, sweat and tears. it's controversial. it's pandering. get ready for 8 seasons of people making dumb decisions, men white knighting to women on a level unknown to mankind, plot holes and sudden iq drops."
2021-02-07,rcam-49059,Brilliance and confusion,10,"one of the greatest shows ever. 1,6 fantastic 7 is alright and 8 was trash. it's worth the watch still but a wtf ending. main reason why this show isn't 10/10"
2020-06-11,veermangat,One of the greatest show till season 8 episode 2.,10,"from s8 episode 3's ending it goes downward. for the first 70 episodes my rating is 11/10 for the last 3 ,0/10 for ruining such a great show"
2020-03-28,pauldmc-53735,Get woke go broke,10,we all know what ruined this series. sadly the amazing efforts of all involved culminate in the most asanine and contrived final season. characters that were previously capable become completely inept (all the male characters after season 4 really) and the female protagonists are given nothing but the inversion of misandrist tropes that only portray how morally bankrupt the ideologues behind this sudden and dramatic shift in tonalities are.
2020-04-01,gamblegrady,"One of the best shows of all time, hands down!",10,"there is never been a show like this one, it is gut wrenching but redeeming! if you hang in there with it, you will be hooked! from the cinematography, to the screenplay, to the characters in the show, character quality, redeemable qualities, lessons learned, and the overall storyline and production, nothing compares!"
2021-01-21,antonlupo,"Really really good, with the exception of the last two seasons",1,honestly it is just disappointing how a bad ending can ruin a great story.
2020-05-08,gthepodcast,Bad ending,10,"such a good serie, well done in every aspect. the photography it's amazing such as the script. but such a disappointing ending, didn't put so much effort to the ending. they leave with the emotion and i think everyone knows that the ending wasn't good."

so, got, where should i start or what should i say first!! first of all this is my very first series(web/tv) in my life, & i'm overwhelmed about this being my very first one. this series contains everything.. i mean everything, drama, love, passion, fanatasy, some sort of unrealistic materials like dragons (still believable), fight, hate, emotions, crying, screaming, thrill, goosebumps. everything, anyone can want for. the series first shown on tv on 2009, from then it has become one of the greatest series in history. now coming to the content, season (1,6) , it's unbelievably beautiful !! there's some less in season 7,8 but as i'm a fan , i'm happy !!"
2020-05-14,ashikulislamshagor,A box of a favourite chocolates,10,"this series is a box of chocolates for me. when i have opened this box i had not any idea what's it's taste. but when i opened it i was lost in the greatest taste. and when i finished it i became sad ""why it's finished"" season 1 , 6 was fabulous. 7 was not so bad.
buy 8 made me disappointed..
but it is my favourite one forever."
2020-06-12,luisa-23255,The Perfect Show,10,"as a fantasy fan, it doesn't get better than this. this show is the most incredible and visually stunning of all time. it holds you tight from the very beginning with the epicness of its story. top notch visuals, music, special effects, casting. everything is high quality and it draws you in. from the very first scene to the very last. you get drama, intrigue, death, romance, sweetness, cruelty and most of all, you get to watch the duality of human nature. we can be good but we can also be terrifying and despicable when corrupted by ambition and power.for all of that, got became very loved and followed by millions and millions of people. we became so invested in the story that we all created our own theories and endings. the show grew bigger than itself. that became a problem and the reason why so many of us were disappointed with the finale. it was also because the last two seasons were a little rushed and, because of that, the dialogue and coherence suffered a declined in quality. still, it was beautiful, compelling and very entertaining.i understand why so many fans are upset. we wanted the very best, the most perfect ending because we loved and cared for the show, and we all had our own expectations of how the story should have ended. i was heartbroken, like so many, and angry. nevertheless, i rewatched all the seasons again and then something happened; season 8 didn't seemed that bad. actually, it was kind of how it was supposed to end. this was got after all. a scary sad world that made us cry and feel so many dark emotions. you feel gutted. every character ended the way it had too, even my dear jon. i wanted him to be king and i wanted a happy ending with dany. after all those years of suffering i wanted the disney ending. i was a fool to expect that. the only thing that i cannot and will not forgive is that jon never got his fight with the night king. that severed the character in my opinion. also, the last scene of dany and jon should have been more dramatic. the scene looked gorgeous, the dialogue was good but the death part was unsatisfying. she should have said something, do something! but it all ends quickly and in silence. it felt like a simple ordinary death for an amazingly complex character.i could say so many other things but in summary, i highly recommend this show. it is so worthy of your time and the 1 star ratings are a high disrespect to all people involved into delivering such a movie like masterpiece into our tvs. watch it and be the judge. you will cry a lot. that, i can assure you."
2020-08-25,ivanamandric,THE END F***** UP THE SHOW!,8,"i hate this end so much! there is still hope in me that they will do the last season all over again, because this ruined the entire show!"
2020-08-02,jyotindranathstcet,Season 1 - 7 : Mindblowing ; Season 8: Disappointing,10,"i have to say that show makers have ended this amazing show in a rush so we can't able to know many things that belong to actual novel . they produced their own story in season 8 and did n't wait for finishing the actual novel of the author sir george r r martine. so,it becomes a disaster , i think . my opinion is that got would take 5 more seasons to end up in a legendary as well as in a proper way and it would break all the records of other tv shows . it could have been all time heighest rated tv show ever produced in planet earth. overall it is full of entertainment and outstanding."

2011-04-19,geisterkarle,Really Surprised!,10,"damn you george r.r. martin! don't do movies, finish the damn next book ... oh wait ... he did! ok! than let's look at the series...well, above statement has a meaning: i read the books! yeah, big deal, but when i did i always thought: ""it is not possible to do a movie about this!"" and i was right! ... but they did a series! and i can't really believe it, but: it (well, the pilot) is quite good! never expected that! also funny how many people talk about the nudity and/or the gore. yes you see some breasts and so on ... so what? this is a fantasy, that is realistic (if you didn't read the books and don't know, what i mean by that: wait and watch the series ... and you will be surprised!) so the scenes are realistic too! i like that! adds more to the feeling of the books!the main problem is, that if you don't know the books you are quite lost with the characters and what happened to all of them. but i hope we will get deeper into the minds and backgrounds of those people! the cast for that is really well done and i hope for they can pass on the feelings i got when i read the book!overall: great start, hoping for brilliance!"
2020-07-27,kaitlinkat,"Seasons 1-4 are fantastic, 5-6 are mixed and seasons 7-8 are poor",10,"the show is fantastic in general, from the acting to soundtrack to costume design. i was a super fan, i even cosplayed as daenerys & cersei. however my passion for the show has certainly taken a downhill turn since season 8. it's a great show in the beginning but after season 4 it starts to slowly go downhill, with season 8 being the worst."
2021-01-25,mrthaarakesh,The Best In Everything...,1,"after watching this i became a fan for it. everything in this series in outstanding. it is the best tv series i ever saw. nothing can beat it. every episode ending gives goosebumps, every season is awesome. a very very very different ending. must watch it."
2020-10-26,varshil-08440,Game of lives,5,story is great. characters are awesomely casted. music is all time hit. superb job.
2021-02-22,tahaeltayeb,Game of thrones :A legandary series,10,"game of thrones is a famous series which has had a million views, game of thrones is based on a series of novel ""song ice and fire"" by george rr martin, so the story takes place in westeros , the most famous family in westeros are ""stark"" and "" lannister"" and ""targaryen"".in the world of ""game of thrones"" you can find dragons and witches , and people who can change their faces called ""faceless"" and in the north we have the real danger the group of death ""white walkers"" but they are divided by a wall which is huge and very solid.so the story is realistic and mixed with fantasy, even it had a bad ending, it remains one of my favorite series.ta ha."
2020-11-11,bartvanarkel,I also loved season 8,3,"almost all people loved the first 7 seasons, so did i. and after such a great masterpiece people get dissapointed about the ending because they wanted to end otherwise. i also didnt hoped for this ending but i still found it soo exciting anf beautiful.
the cast and creators worked so very hard to complete this work of art from the man named george r r martin.
please see for yourself that this show and its ending are : satisfying, beautiful,horrifying and epic as hell!!! got!!"
2021-05-23,jigishsanena,Simply one of the best,10,"though there is hatred towards the last season from majority of fans i feel it didn't deserve it i'd you haven't read the books you will probably like it. it is one of the shows worth binge watching. the dragons, the magic, the army of dead, the different kingdoms, the politics for the throne, there are just so many aspects. the drama and action when mixed with fantasy it's always good and the justice given to the roles by their actors just makes it mind blowing. it is a show you just cannot miss."
2021-03-15,harshitrathee,Mind blowing,10,slightly disappointed with season 7&8 but overall this series is awesome even i can't express this series in words.
2020-10-25,ritwikgaur,U don't watch GOT..U Live GOT......,9,legendary.... best thing to watch in entire milky way...... no words to describe....
2020-11-18,fabrey-28619,The Best tv serie ever,10,"got is the beat serie tv never made. its part of me, part of my culture. the s8 is very sad"
2015-05-04,elise-algernon,Blood Splattered Soft Porn Set in the Middle Ages,10,"i wrote an amazon review when i finally got around to watching got and ended up with crazed fans coming out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong i was to not like got. after watching more episodes because , as got fans insisted - i needed to see more to understand/like the show - i decided that the got is not for me - even if the beatings will continue 'till morale will improve.. watching more didn't improve my opinion really - it only made me feel nauseated. i felt i was only stating the obvious in saying that there is a lot of pointless gratuitous sex and graphic violence on got. for some - that's what they like about the show. for me - it's a needless distraction to what could have been a compelling story.here is my original review of got:as a lifelong geek, i've been hearing a lot about got for a while now and had high hopes of it filling the much-needed niche for satisfying story-telling that i came to know and love in such shows as firefly and the lord of the rings trilogy - or at least something intelligent, interesting, creative and well thought out. visually, game of thrones is gorgeous - at least in the initial snow speckled scenes, where you see a group of heavily bundled up guys in a very stark snow scape. just one look at the costuming and the beautiful filming really sparks any geek to say, ""hey- this might be really good."" knowing that the guy who was boromir in lotr is playing a major role also gives hopes and expectations of something really great.the initial scenes where one of the riders stumbles upon a truly grisly scene of carnage is difficult to watch - but at least you get the sense that there is something going on, some kind of mystery - that needs to be solved and the question of just who the white walkers are is intriguing. so despite the gore, i was initially very much taken in.and that's about where my interest stopped as the first episode devolved into pointless scenes of violence, sex, nudity, more sex - still more sex - to the point where it became a bit absurd and almost dull. so sad to ruin something that could have been epic with a lot of sex scenes that weren't even in the original books. the gore and grisly scenes of beheadings and splatter porn also painfully reminded me of the really horrible rendition of the hobbit, where something that was written as a kid's story (talking about the hobbit here) was made into a gory display of constant sword fights and beheadings. it kind of reduces all of human existence to one that is animalistic and somewhat mundane: animals are born, they hunt for and/or find food, they have sex, make other little animals, fight each other for territory (possibly) and die. fine. but a fantasy that makes it seem like all of human existence boils down to this common denominator (and nothing more) is not only uninteresting and uninspired - it's dead depressing. it also seems such a waste of excellent casting, costuming, cinematographic excellence and a story that might capture my interest - if the makers of the series wasn't so insistent and determined to fill every scene with sex of every sort and violence. all the flying offal and swinging tits really distract from what might have been an interesting story.the first episode of got was the most graphic thing i've ever seen - including that time when some college housemates rented a porn movie and that other time when some other friends had a halloween horror movie marathon. at least the gore in those movies had a point and made sense in the progress of the story, whatever story that was and the sex scenes actually were important in the plot - or at least vaguely important for the plot. (it's saying something when the sex and gore in the average horror flick is more meaningful than the sex and gore in got.) all the sex and blood splattered scenes of got just seem to make the whole thing less believable. it's hard to really get lost in the story and really imagine being there - when every scene is a blood-soaked and sex-filled rampage to the point of being ridiculous. the sex seems less real - because there's so much of it. the gore seems less important - because there's too much of it. the actual story is completely overwhelmed by the heavy-handedness all the sex and violence.if a fellow geek friend were to ask me about game of thrones - i would comment that the opening credits were really nicely done - with a sort of steampunk, nanotechnology and clever clockwork building of the map, castles, houses and landscape with these interesting ladders connecting various areas of the map. the opening credits was awesome - far more inspired than the series itself. the music is well done. the casting is brilliant (and would have been amazing - or could have been, if such talent wasn't wasted and drowned out by all the other stuff.) visually (when every scene isn't blood soaked and/or crammed from end to end with pointless sex and violence) - game of thrones is really beautiful - with its gorgeous period costuming and sets and great cinematography. the actual story - the one that i might have been more interested in learning more about, if it weren't for all the gore, guts and grunts - is something i'm sad that i won't get a chance to know without reading a plot synopsis somewhere else. but the actual series just comes off as a porn flick with lots and lots of violence that happens to be set in the middle ages."
2020-11-14,suryapraksh-94104,Best of best,10,feeling good after watching all the episodes of got. i will definitely recommend this series watch it first. a outstanding series but ending can be better.
2020-11-22,jk-58908,Seasons 1-4 are amazing. Throw the rest in the trash.,10,the decline in writing between the first and last seasons would be hilarious if it weren't so disappointing.
2020-11-26,hannybrown,Absolutely brilliant... just ditch the last season,9,"the characters, the dialogue, the plot, the scenery, the twists! i definitely recommend!but imagine you have a pizza right. the golden base and wow the best tomato sauce. you add some cheese... all the different types. then ham, mushroom, chicken absolutely anything you want. and then you throw pineapple. then kiwi. watermelon. you drop it on the floor and it's ruined.well thats what the 8th season did. they completely rushed into daenerys break down. i love the idea of the mad queen but you can't take an adored character and make her mad in what... a few episodes. if they had taken the time that plot could have worked and been superb but they rushed it and it made no sense.john snow. what the bloody hell did he do in that season? ""you are my queen"" said that about 50 times but apart from killing his aunt then nothing much more. they completely wasted his character and in the end he just gets banished like... is that it?bran. what on earth is the use of his powers if all he does in the main battle between the night kind is watch over as a raven. why not try take control of the dragon that was in control by the night king. or even try take control of the knight king himself. i mean seriously do something.jaime. they just complete ruined his characters arc and just decided to take all of his growth and character development and through it in the bin. oh and cersei's death is certainly not satisfactory. arya could have taken jaime's face (in the books the person doesn't have to be dead to use their face) and killed her. or maybe she could have used the face of one of her children. why such a short season to finish game of thrones? they could have easily make up to 12 series in total. the battle between the night king and the white walkers lasted one episode! the first thing you saw on game of thrones were the white walkers. it was so anti climatic.""winter is coming"" as we were warned for seasons that it will be the longest winter. please, it lasted barely a few episodes.
also, why do nearly all of the characters survive the attack from the night king. i mean come on even sam survived. this isn't game of thrones! think of the red wedding! think of all the sudden unexpected deaths , ned stark for example!it shows everyone that as soon as game of thrones ran out of books, well it went downhill from there. hopefully, when the books are finished, all of us get the ending that we hope for. i just wish they would remake season 8.
there's so much more i want to say. i could rant on about the season forever. it's a shame how such a masterpiece is so easily ruined."
2020-11-30,alwwc,Its Great,10,"the greatest series in history, i love him very much. i hope the actors will perform in another great series ... thank you"
2020-11-28,ice_x_,Exceptional show,10,"amazing story line, character development, acting and a good soundtrack.too many wah wah cry babies thinking season 7 and/or 8 were ""terrible"" for no reason. best ending a show has had, no, but it made sense (mostly)."
2020-12-03,hammadgill,10/10,8,i have never watched a season like this. though a difference of opinions among the fans and that's the beauty of the game of thrones.
2021-03-03,ahmedomar-57453,Best serie ever,10,"game of thrones is not it's a story from george r. r martin. fighting, houses, horses, wars, battles, betrayals, love, dragons, rebellion castles, cities, westeros, isus, swords, and sharp valerian steel are all present in game of thrones."
2021-07-15,ahmedomar-57453,The best serie ever,10,"it's hard. to determine the quality of this series of drama, wars, fights and comedy he's worth 9.9, except season eight."
2020-12-21,dagosha,A huge let-down,10,"this has been the biggest let,down for me, ever.the books and the beginnings (first 4 seasons) of the show made me become a fan. i purchased the bluray boxes asap. and then the big middle finger to the fans in the last two seasons. it was almost the same as the last episode of 2.5 men - the only thing missing being the actors talking directly to the camera.knowing how it ended i wouldn't even want to rewatch any of the older seasons.there are series with bad endings, but they normally don't affect the series as a whole. in this case it's all down the dtain."
2020-12-27,elianejohnson,Love it !,10,"started watching season 1 in 2011, but didnt finish watching it because sean bean died :p and i was so disappointed. now ive watched all 8 seasons (started 3 weeks ago) and i must say im sooo happy i did ! didnt really know what i was missing until now. there are 8 seasons ,and of course there are scenes that i like more than others but overall i give it 10 / 10 because in my opinion its one of the best tv shows ive ever seen . love everything about it ! there are times when ive started crying and times when ive got chills down my spine ( like the final white walker battle when all those flaming swords disappeared in the night ,and one by one the darkness took their light..the eerie silence after that... ) something about that scene that i found extremely creepy and disturbing :d) white walkers are death ,and something about that metaphor is giving me the creeps ..) and when cercei and jamie died together in each others arms...even tho she was the most evil char of them all , i actually felt sorry for her, she didnt chose to be who she was and personally i think i can see the deeper meaning behind every cruel act she did-its still cruel and all that of course but there was a reason behind it all - love all the actors and actresses , i feel everyone fit their role perfectly ! i didnt understand what all the fuss about this game of thrones thing was in the beginning ,but now i see it clear as day :)"
2021-01-02,parmaramanv,Best in class,1,overall osam but end of season 8 quite unexpected and by it i am unsatisfied
2021-06-08,wasaybaggins,Still there is no any other show as Game of Thrones.,10,"filled with so much complicated, addictive and appealing characters and set in a kinda dark brooding and realistic world despite being grounded in fantasy , this is the best fantasy thing ever existed imo. lotr is also brilliant but honestly has not that addictive and appealing feel. but here we have brilliantly directed war sequence which are so intense that we literally pray whole the time for our favorite to make it.we have wars , queens , dragons night king and his frozen zombie armies, etc in this show and this make great entertainment. it has also lots of metaphor for current on going politics in the world (also granted the fact that it has parallels with real european history.)climax of the show was divided. dany die hard fans think it was literally bad whereas jon and tyrion fans think is was good. i also think it was emotionally satisfying ending(against all the odds.) watching jon leaving the king's landing and joining the night's watch again was a one goddamn emotional ending for me. i also instantly remembered that how stubborn was jon to join the night's watch in the beginning of the series.we also have breaking bad ,sapronas and both are literally great. but i don't think anyone of them are as appealing and addictive as this one."

2021-01-17,khaildasaker,The amazing Game of Thrones,10,one of the beautiful and fun series to watch and actors are creative at acting

2021-01-25,lambaankit-42141,its just amazing.,8,its just perfect to sya in one word. the acting is just awesome. and the vfx has no competition.
2021-01-27,carlahenriquesc-51974,Amazone TV show but...,10,"for fans of fantasy, this is an outstanding show except for the last two seasons... and the ending? disappointing in my point of view.. you can clearly see when george rr martin stopped being a consultant for the series.
season 1 to 5 were amazing, well written, well filmed and quite similar as the books. however seasons 6 and 7, there are no books nor guidelines so we got a lot more action, a lot less dialogue and a bit of nonsense the worse being daenerys fastest downward spiral to the mad queen and bran the king of the seven kingdoms"
2021-02-13,luckyluck-79701,Awesone,9,this is the best serial ever. a great journey. no other comments.
2021-02-15,kjputq,The ending wasn't that bad,5,got is an amazing world with amazing variance of characters that act their rolls flawlessly. i liked it.
2021-03-25,cursedlovesherbestfriend,I dont understand the bad reviews of season 8,9,"season 8 was by far the season that made more sense, other endings to this would be completely illogical and borderline psychotic . all the characters i've grown to like ended like they should , even the ""bad guys"" . i'm sorry but why is everyone so pissed off ? season 8 was the reason i actually enjoyed all the previous seasons , i've seen way worse season finales . if you really think about it .. they actually broke the wheel. its amazing !!!"
2021-05-15,stellakokorinos,Season 8 broke my heart,9,"the 10 stars are for seasons 1 to 7 , one of the greatest tv series ever made. but with season 8 it seems all the writers wanted to do was tie up all the loose ends and get to their next project. so very disappointed. not really interested in any of the prequels what's the point now."

2021-05-15,hathanh-74188,Would have been the best,10,"i thought i was about to witness something as magnificent as lotr up until season 7. after then the show was so so bad, esp s.8 where i had to skip most of the show running time due to bad dialogue. its like all the things the characters talked about was pointless. and what was bran the broken about? i have waited for bran to actually contribute something huge to the result after he was revealed as someone with supernatural ability, but in the end he contributed absolutely nothing. and dany character development is unbelievable, and i refuse this ending. havent read the books but i will wait for it and erase the memory of season 8!gave it an 8 because i loved season 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 so much!!"

2021-09-23,avishekshah-07264,"Don't think, Go for it !! It Worth Watch !!",10,"whole series it all about an iron throne and rivalary among tribes for that throne using their tactics, plots, stratigies, etc. you will get chance to see and learn about politics, tactics, plots, illusion, cheats, leadership, etc. all the seasons are awesome but last season (season 8) somehow dissapoints the viewer. but afterall it worths a watch, give it a shot."
2021-06-21,nirmalsinghrawat-32477,First non- indian web series watched.,10,"amazing web series. loved the character ""jamie lannister"" as the seasons progress,which i hated the most at beginning. saw one of the gruesome villian character ""ramsay bolten"". loved every character."

2021-09-24,lidor322,Masterpiece!,10,"probably one of the best tv series i've ever watched.amazing story and writing (at least the first 7 seasons), great acting, phenomenal soundtrack.it could have been a 10/10, and perhaps the best tv series of all time were it not for the 8th season.for those who still have not watched the series , go watch it! it may be a frustrating ending, as you've all probably heard, but it's still worth your time."
2011-12-20,aarbyy,Spoiled Fun,10,"there is much intelligence evident in the writing for this series. the story is solid. but it's presented as something akin to the lord of the rings, full of magic and wonder. it is not only boring and slow, this series, but it's relentlessly grim , like the daily news. i'd rather have the daily news. when i read it, i am looking for the info and expect it to be bad. when i'm looking for entertainment, while betrayal, destruction and good guys and gals loosing may be part of the story, i am not looking for only grim, which is what you get here. as for the supernatural and fantastic, it's next to non existent.you have the odd shot of a cool looking kingdom and that's it. when it looks cool from a distance, once we get closer and behind the gates, there's the same old blah.this isn't entertainment in any positive sense."
2021-10-23,geiasasmagkes,"Possibly Best TV show ever created,was it not for the last 2 seasons",5,"one of the best book to tv adaptations ever created,every episode that followed the source material was executed close to perfection,but then they ran out of original story script and when the screenwriters had to fill martins boots,they failed miserably."

2019-05-23,ahmadke,Satisfying in every way ..,8,"there is not much to say about game of thrones which has not already been said. the show is absolutely brilliant all around up until the very end. yes, do not listen to all the negative reviews of the final season, game of thrones stays true to itself up until the very end and it never fails to catch you off guard all the way until the last episode. the show will be sorely missed for it is doubtful if there will ever be anything quite like it."

2011-08-16,webbeachboy,Hasn't quite made up it's mind what it is supposed to be...,1,"i forced myself to watch all the episodes of game of thrones and just couldn't get into it. it doesn't seem to know exactly what it is or where it is going. i think it's trying to be another ""lost"" or ""24"" , aiming to continue forever.the storyline is strangely ""untogether"" and it is not sure if it is a mythical tale or monster movie. the producers have gone to great lengths to find bizarre characters to populate the screen and surprise us - but they don't ""gell"""" together.i still cannot work out why they are all talking with northern english accents (i keep waiting for ""ee by gum it's coud up 'ere innit"" to be thrown into the conversation).obviously unsure of their own product, large dollops of sex have been thrown into the pot to make it sell. the final 'thing' is uneven and unsatisfying. perhaps ""game of thrones part 274"" will be better....."
2013-11-23,super33318,HBO came back again with excellent TV Show,8,"first of all entire credit goes to george r.r. martin,d.b. weiss and david benioff for writing a wonderful script and then to directors and other departments worked for this show and kept in front of us. generally i don't watch fantasy and drama genres but started to watch it then season begins between two royal families and kept on watching season by season that made me worth to watch its twists and waiting others to come.in this show every character has equal importance with a nice screenplay.main theme song is nicely composed. after watching three seasons i can plot it in single line, main aim to capture the throne but having lot of depth involved mainly in betrayal. be patient to watch the show then only it will be interest if not don't judge it by seeing two to three episodes. till know there is no flaw in the show hope not will be in coming seasons also. finally the series is simply fantastic."
2011-04-19,fil-kolev,"As expected, some will love it, some will hate it",7,"fantasy... is there a more difficult genre for tv? it is so hard to make a great show, and so very easy to completely ruin it. experience has taught fans to be cautious as they've dealt with countless disappointments. it also skews opinion for the general audience (whatever that means, i rarely generalize), yet, i believe it somehow does.so, you've been hyped? we all were, which intensifies all positives and negatives. i won't praise it too much, other reviews do that quite well (and not quite so well). here i'll try to address the people who haven't seen the show and are trying to decide whether to watch it, or have seen some but are still undecided whether to keep watching. therefore i look at what turned most people away (from what i've read so far). the confusion. there are many characters in a song of ice and fire and really no easy way to introduce them on screen. they all play a significant role and although things will be omitted, it will still be... epic. the first episodes will be the most difficult to follow. hbo know this and are trying to relieve the problem with various features and guides. go check them out if you were frustrated by the scope of the show. it really has to be given a chance, at least several episodes, in order for it to work. the sex and violence. there is a lot of sex and violence, i agree. but is it really that much different from other shows by networks unconstrained by ratings? boardwalk empire, true blood, the tudors, and so on and so on. would it be a different story if this wasn't fantasy? perhaps. have in mind that all of this is much more prominent in the books (without being anywhere near a theme), it's not thrown for the sake of it, and it serves a purpose , to build the characters. the plot. someone said predictable? this is one of the most unpredictable stories ever told. it's big and complex and it goes to places you'd never expect. or wish. it's not history, so there are no moments like ""anne boleyn? i know how this one ends... just a matter of time."" it's not fairy-tale like lord of the rings where the good guys ride dragons and eventually defeat the bad guys. there it all comes down to how exactly the bad guy will be killed and how many fictitious extraordinary places we'll visit before it happens. eragon is predictable. a song of ice and fire is shocking, surprising and very, very addictive. game of thrones therefore has a huge potential to be just like that. if you are willing to let it do it's magic.why the hype? surely some will be disappointed due to it. but the reality is, because of the genre (and the series is not quite what is expected of the genre), hbo needed to bring in as many people as possible and hope that enough of them will go the distance of several episodes i'd assume are needed to achieve the ""crack on paper"" effect of the source material. so, don't feel cheated. it was expected that some (perhaps many) viewers will not understand and like it.last point. it is not fair to judge an entire show from a single pilot. i'm sure halfway through the season those who watched without being too involved will not regret it. those who changed the channel will miss a great fantasy story, and well told at that."
2019-10-30,dny,Amazing TV series,10,"at times this is among the best that have ever been produced for tv, and i enjoyed all of it from the first to the last episode. i just wish the last season would have been made into two or three 10,episode seasons instead. while season 8 is still great it feels a bit rushed without the depth of the earlier seasons. with that said, some of the most powerful scenes from the entire series is in the final season."
2014-06-17,bewyan,Mind blowing! highly addictive!!,8,"i am usually not the type of person that watches tv,series. of all the tv-series, i only liked breaking bad and of course game of thrones! game of thrones is without comparison the best of those two.to begin with i thought it was another over-hyped show, until i read some of the reviews and the user ratings on imdb, then i gave it a chance. by the end of the first episode, i was already hooked. there is so much going on at the same time and you will never bored watching this masterpiece of a tv show. the characters are all amazing. one of the best part is (like breaking bad) you can't really figure out what is going to happen. if you want to watch a tv show that contains it all; love, war, greed, treachery, violence, suspense and much more, then you have come to the perfect place. you will find many characters that you will either hate or love, and george r.r. martin is not afraid of killing one or two of your favorite characters. after all, valar morghulis (all men must die)"
2018-07-30,acting101-2,Amazing,2,10/10 no question from start all the way to season 7. riveting fantasy that feels feels. the acting is of another world and the directing is a master piece. enjoy the ride.

2012-09-06,niallmulligan,"Had originally gave it a 5 rating, but it does get much better.",1,"i started watching this at the recommendation of a friend. i have to say at first, i did not see what all the fuss was about. in the opening scene i thought, this is going to be good, only to follow the majority of season one being consistently disappointed, bored , and hoping for it to get better. i only kept watching because,asides from rave reviews, and a fabulous cast, i did enjoy the stunning scenery, and actually recognized some of the non-cgi'd landscapes from my childhood, as some scenes were shot where i grew up. all the scenery, however, is amazing- and i find myself totally drawn into this fictional land as a result. i will say though that it took me the most of season 1, to get a feel for the show, and while it was really slow for me at coming together, the first season ended with everything that i was hoping for. i never read the books that led to this screenplay, but if the screen adaptation is anything to go by, i would imagine that it would be like one of these books that you have difficulty getting into, but once you do you absolutely can't put it down. i'm just beginning season 2 , and am very glad i didn't give up on this show. hat's off to the brilliant acting from the cast- even with the slowness of season 1 , their amazing talent still shone through and were another reason i stuck with it."
2019-05-20,reef2480,This story deserved better!,8,"as a whole, game of thrones from season 1,5 was epic. it had problems, (arya in bravos story line) in particular. but the show was well written and executed for the most part.however- seasons 6-8 slowly start to unravel as far as plot points and storytelling. seasons 7-8 are a total mess and by this time my suspension of disbelief is gone. i never feared for our main characters lives in these last seasons. that's where you know things are getting bad. take waking dead for example, great start up to when they left the prison, it completely falls apart to a point that it just gets laughed at now.season 8- where do i start... well the story arc of daenerys targaryen is completely ruined and destroyed. jon snow never fulfills the prophecy, brand story arc with the three eyes raven is a complete joke. and the lannister deaths were cheap. don't get me started on arya stark and the plot armor that surrounded her since she left bravos. the battle of winter fell was such a let down of biblical proportions. the white walkers and night king were destroyed in one dagger poke. nothing is ever given a proper explanation, it's so ambiguous. that's just lazy writing 101.i hope that whoever reads this understands that i loved this show and the books. i'm not here to crap on it."
2020-04-09,r_m_fan,"Fantastic beginning, terrible finish",10,"this was my favorite show of all time until season 8. season 8 is such a crap fest that i have no desire to ever rewatch this show. that being said, seasons 1,5 are some of the best tv that you'll ever find. seasons 6 and 7 arent great and you definitely see a drop in quality. season 8 is a dumpster fire. seasons 6-8 are extremely rushed, and have a barely coherent storyline."
2011-05-09,ramikz23,"Genius , Brilliant , Amazing",10,"wow just wow . this show surpassed my every expectation by far .excellent acting. very good cast. beautiful scenery. 4 episodes in and i simply cant wait another week for the 5th one . the story and even the dialogs stay true to the books. i really can't understand the bad reviews few posted here. how brain dead someone needs to be to not appreciate this masterpiece.simply one of the best shows to hit tv. usually i skip few weeks in order to watch few episodes at once but with this show i just cant hold it . do not listen to the childish reviews if you love deep plot, evolving characters,epic scale then this show is for you !!"
2011-04-17,steppy91,This one will blow you away!,8,"love, betrayal, greed, murder, corruption all collides in mythical world of westeros. george r. r. martin's world is unlike any other fantasy world you have ever seen. the main conflict lies between two families: house of stark and house of lannister, but there are many more stores to be toldeddard stark (sean bean) is the main character of the series, and the story is mostly about him. since hbo has staked a lot of money into this series, there will be a lot of colorful characters, just like it the books. the art dept. has done a magnificent job by creating a whole new world from scratch. costumes, armors, landscape, photography all has been done in well,known hbo way. travel along side your heroes, from the cold north, and the wall with jon snow, across the desert-city on the south, with ned stark, and join daenerys and her riders on a mission to retrieve the iron throne.let the game of thrones begin!"

2019-05-20,faraz-mirza,The most promising epic saga turned to trash.,10,"game of thrones season 8 rant:season 8 is the most disappointing end to the most sought after and discussed show in the history of television.it started as the most intelligent, thrilling, mysterious epic saga and ended as the most dumb and simplistic end.it clearly seemed that the characters were different their motives were different in first six seasons and in the last season they seemed like having a different soul or mindset. clearly shows the change in writing and the idea of overall story.harry potter, lord of the rings, the dark knight all had that big ending which makes them epic. even avengers end game did justice to their universe.game of thrones was regarded above all of these but ended up as a trash."
2019-05-20,ady-andrei,Season 8 ruined the show,9,"hbo, you actually did it! you have ruined the show.
all together, seoson 8 was not worth watching, but the real cherry on the cake was the finale..."
2011-05-02,nospam01-903-775157,Great views,3,"besides the very interesting and complex story the landscape is fantastic, the costumes impressing and detailed. the actors are first rate and the story is not for the faint of heart. definitely no children's book! the special effects are very good for a tv show and they don't overdo it. i never saw anything like it and i'm glad that for once i did not read the books first, which can be a bummer if you have a vivid imagination and the director has a different one. the high definition makes every detail stand out beautifully, even too detailed for some scenes. for example the little girl's rapier, named 'needle' has a clearly visible round security tip at the supposedly pointy end, which is the only complaint i have.:,)"
2014-02-18,hugofranca-922-317788,"Poor storytelling, slow and boring",1,"i'll start by pointing out what i like about this show; good cinematography and acting. the rest is standard directing, mediocre soundtrack and a poor script.i've been in a situation many times, where a dialogue was going on and they spoke of other characters but i didn't seem to know who where they speaking of. i spent the entire first season trying to memorize the names of many of the characters (including some of the main ones). the second season actually made me memorize some of their names. excluding the main characters the other characters are briefly introduced, nothing outlines them to make you remember which character is who. do the script writers expect me to read the books before watching this?worth mentioning that 90% of the show is dialogue, which is ok if it actually leads to something and it's a drama, instead of a fantasy series. dialogue is mostly irrelevant and boring. it leads nowhere most of the time and does not contribute to the storyline. and in the rare moments it actually does, nothing happens next. you are hang with the promise of everything happening the next season. and to your disappointment, it doesn't. more dialogue and nothing happening. more promises...the story moves slowly. as if they had to stretch the whole thing to make every dollar of the budget count. daenerys targaryen could possibly be my favorite character, but she spends, up until now, 4 seasons to build an army and reach the iron throne (which i doubt it will only be in the 5th season, with some luck). that's how slow and boring this is.whenever an episode finishes, i feel no urge to see the next one. there is nothing that lefts me hanging. i just feel like if they pulled the plug on this one it wouldn't make a difference to me.mediocre show with dragons and special effects. people digest this crap because they are hungry for a fantasy series with a big budget. a well made lord of the rings style series. that's what viewers crave for. and this is the only reason people watch this and feel good about it. this show has no direct competition or it would be dead in the first season.oh, and some advice. if you do actually watch this; you can take a leak, prepare your popcorn, grab a beer and call your friends to come over, all during the intro."
2012-02-27,sander_vanheste,Deep and Entertaining,9,"game of thrones is a great series, not mainly because of it's great visual effects, fast action and cinematic looks (although those are pretty good too...), but because of it's characters. they are all extremely believable and interesting, they really are the heart of this series. should those characters be taken away, then everything collapses dramatically, for sure. almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. with every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. the only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective. but that's a detail and doesn't nearly compare to the greatness of this series. i really recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it!"
2019-05-20,markus-astrand,Brilliant,10,"everyone raging against season 8 are just mindless puppets. how was it suppose to end? john sitting on the iron throne like everyone predicted at season 1? the story stays true to its nature and have plot twists all the way to the end. and the vision danny saw in season 2 was true. entering that broken throne room and then get to meet her beloved drogo and her son. this was always the plan, and people complaining about the tempo of the shows last 2 seasons must know that it would have gone on for another 10 years if theyve keept the tempo of the first seasons and it would have been extreemly boring!great show from begining to end!"

2014-05-04,mohsin_taj,About This TV series,5,"i have seen so many tv series, movies.. game of thrones is something magical, a true creation & making with extra ordinary story & script writing. perfect & outrageous.this is the top, the best tv series. well done & best of luck for future, because we need such dedication for next 100 season's..the detail's , that's what matter, how to handle all the character's & to continue story with their strong character's is very challenging. who will take the throne?. ha ! who knows. my fav. character is "" peter dinclage "" as tyrion lannister .again in the end , i have never written anything any where but it was worth it.god bless you all"
2011-06-28,romanos-romaidis,Excellent Series,10,"game of thrones is probably one of the greatest series of all time,the production value is great,costumes,sceneries,music and atmosphere really drags you in an amazing world that in someway reminds me lord of the rings ,of course this does not mean that its exactly the same but it has some elements of the lotr world... sean bean is playing great the role ned stark,the other actors are also making a great job too.i suggest this movie to everyone,you will adore it and you will buy the books,its guaranteed!:) i suggest you to watch these series in hd with 5.1 surround,these features enhance the whole experience. whatever i will write i cannot describe the amazing feeling of watching this great series,try yourself the experience and you will be addicted to the imaginary world of the series!let the game of thrones begin.."
2013-05-14,fahad-fireflash,A show which will stand the test of time,6,"this is the best season that has ever been aired for a long long time.what makes it so special is that every person who sees this season can gaze in its vast ocean of characters and find the one character that echos his personality that is the mirror image of his own self.rather than being showing a romantic,hollow and masked portrayal it is rude,bold,passionate,naked and above all the true depiction of the world.where the wars are not as simple as it seems and love is not happy endings, marriages are held together not by love but by fear,anger,lust and children.where kingdoms rise and fall on the deceit of men hungry for either power,glory or gold.where honor to some means more than life but to others just a bunch of hollow words.this season is a masterclass and i can easily say it is the mozart of television.this season will pass the test of time for generations to watch the curious ways of the game of thrones"
2011-06-21,ognjenkisic,Was doubting for a moment but that was over really fast !,10,"as a movie and a tv series freak i was doubting for a while that hbo maybe took a big bite whit this series,but luckily that wasn't the case.hbo did a great job whit this one and i am sure that it will stay like that.i am a little puzzled by the fact that no one tried to make a movie rather then a tv series like whit ""the lord of the rings"" saga.best tv series i watched so far ( and i watched a lot ),i am really thankful to hbo for putting in the extra effort to not go away from the storyline and production/wise it was more then i expected.pure 10 in my opinion regards ognjen kisic"
2011-04-27,prometheus-unbound,Deserved of a Throne,5,"after watching the first episodes i could ramble on about how visually stimulating it all is, how the script is brilliantly interlaced to suite scene composition and the mood, how the sounds and scores multiply the intensity of the setting. i could also ramble on about how great the cast is, how every character looks as if they were born to play this one role, or how from the opening credits you are immediately aware that you are going to be taken deep into this world that you know nothing about and that it will be one heck of a journey.but i won't ramble on about any of that, because in the end, once its all said and done, you will only remember how that movie, that show, that book made you feel. all of the above enthralls you and literally drags you into king's landing, into winterfell or (god forbid) into the icy realms of the north.every character is interlaced with something else, whether this be another character, another place, another being. when something impacts one you immediately feel for them because you understand exactly where they are situated in the grander scheme of things. this systematic entanglement of characters will serve as the backdrop for the script throughout the series. as we hear the knife slit the throat of lady we see the young stark awake, you know that something has changed, you know that with every passing breath the young stark will never be the same.if you want pure fantasy this isn't for you, supernatural elements make appearances throughout the show but they aren't fundamental, they merely serve as a detached entity, something outside the bounds of the world of man, something to understand but not to approach, much like the great wall leading to the north.if you want to watch a show which places importance on character interaction and plot composition, then this is for you. the medieval backdrop only amplifies what is sure to become a great television spectacle.game of thrones, deserved of the throne, but can it keep it?"
2011-05-20,tomandrachael-58-943726,A superb adaption,4,"having finished the book just before the tv adaption , it is still very fresh in my mind , and i am very impressed with the tv series so far.the remarkable thing to me is that , all the characters and locations look almost exactly as they did in my mind's eye. with the use of cgi and larger budgets , tv companies are now able to make programmes much more faithful to books than they were able to before.the acting is all excellent , and a special mention must go to peter dinklage's portrayal of tyrion lanister which is terrific.i'm really looking forward to the final few episodes of the series and will then read the next book in the series."
2011-06-09,eye-of-the-tiger,Absolutely Brilliant!!!!,7,"the books are fantastic. the cast is brilliant, minus geoffrey (he looks like a weasel), the scenery and script is also top notch.episodes could be even longer, it might grip people longer to the story. more sex scenes too, like spartacus. also more blood and fighting. more nudity would also add more spark to the show.stark senior is a great actor for his part, there should be more opportunities to make him appear like a main character, particularly special in my opinion.making the show more scenic and putting emphasis on improving the quality of music would also make the show nicer, loving the show. keep it up!"

2011-12-03,apple_scruff1983,Fans of the book rejoice!! A winner in all categories!,9,"i had heard nothing but good things about game of thrones when my boyfriend and i picked up the first season; as such, i had high expectations. i was not disappointed—if anything, my expectations were not high enough. starting in the evening, we intended to watch ""just a couple of episodes."" hours later, as the sun was coming up, we were still glued to the tv. we watched the entire series in just two days. this is easily one of the best acted and best written shows that i have ever watched! imagine my further enthusiasm upon discovering that it was based on a book series. being an avid reader,i picked up the first book in the series a song of fire and ice (which shares the name of the show) at my earliest opportunity. as much as i loved the show, i absolutely expected it to be much different from the book; as an avid reader, i am also aware of how badly most movies and tv shows manage to foul up when making the transition from the written page.i could not have been more wrong. this show follows the book so closely that there are even whole sentences of dialogue that must have been copied directly from the book into the show's script. the few differences are so minute as to not really matter; most of them actually add to the show, rather than being detrimental. in addition, the casting is fantastic. having seen the show first, i worried that the appearance of the actors might color the way i viewed in the characters in the book; this was not the case. although i did, in fact, picture the actors in most cases, it was only because their resemblance to their fictional counterparts had been so closely adhered to in the television adaptation. with so many characters involved in the book's story, one might assume that some of them would have been left on the cutting room floor when the series went to wrap . . . but, as i mentioned, the amazing adaptation included every plot point, no matter how small of a part a character may have. this is good news, as i have seen far too many movies and shows that ignore a supporting character in early episodes only to have the character become a major player later on, leaving a plot hole in the early episodes and people wondering, ""hm, where did this guy come in?""i have not had a chance to begin the second book yet, although after finishing the first one, i immediately went out and bought the rest of the series. as excited as i am about reading the next book, it is with even greater anticipation that i wait for the return of this amazing series. i would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre. truly,i would recommend this show to anyone!! if you are looking for something to watch that is visually and intellectually captivating,incredibly acted and well written, and fun to boot,- or just an entertaining bit of tv to get you through a rainy day-- then you have found it in game of thrones!!"

2019-05-10,claudiof,Season 8 destroys the whole series.,10,the conclusion of the series is nothing short of awful. watch the first 6 seasons and read the books. the showrunners has done their best to make it as bad as possible.

2021-06-01,adamconde12,A Great Start and a steep decline.,10,"this show started off life as a 10/10 show, well adapted from its source material. excellently cast with stunning set design and a soundtrack that was memorable, you can hear a piece and know the related scenes. the performances were award worthy. the cast and crew did brilliantly.then the source material ran dry and the shows decline began. character development that we had seen in the previous seasons was forgotten and characters would begin to make actions that made no sense for what we have seen of these characters previously. plot armour and time jumps became a regular. previous episodes impacts became stunted when armies seemingly respawned.the later seasons of the show were held up by the great cast, the cinematography, the ground breaking special effects and the soundtrack. the set pieces and the work that was done to make westeros come to our screens should always be applauded.this show could of gone down in tv history as one of the greatest shows of all time and has now been left as a teaching piece for future show runners and writers on how easily a great show can be ruined. poor writing and a seeming rush to get things done and move onto the next project shows by those making the decisions and they have put a permanent black spot on their career. if they were not in the position to deliver then the show should of been passed over to a new team who could of delivered what this show was capable of being. but egos and a disney contract get in the way.in still gets a 8/10 from me due to the merit of seasons 1,5 but the later seasons could easily drop this down to a 6 if not for the great work of the cast and the crew."
2020-08-24,tijana9999,IT IS NOT A BAD SHOW,10,"this show always showed us how much it is different from other shows, it's more realistic, the world has been shown cruel and the characters are full of anger. you just cannot expect from a show like that to have a happy ending. daenerys was showing us from season 1 that she has her father genes and that she enjoys having a revenge and killing those who deserve it. her father was the same, he believed he was doing justice until he didn't know anymore who deserves justice and who deserves mercy. i just cannot look at this negative reviews and stay quiet because the ending was marvelous to me and only bad thing they did is that they didn't pay enough attention to season 8 like they did to all the other seasons.. i think that people had too high expectations from ending and the thing with daenerys just blew them off because they expected something else and something more... but let's be real... if they continued the show and made it longer like it is in the books it would probably not be that good show anymore because it would become boring like any other show that has high rating so they try to make it longer because it is succesfull... anyway show ended like it should and you all just say whatever you want :)"
2019-05-20,cesarjuarez666,A incredible show with an even more incredibly BAD Ending,7,"game of thrones is a great show filled with good storyline, great acting and fantastic characters. this show could have been an easy 10/10 but sadly it falls in the infamous category of shows that start great, but end horrendously bad. the show gives me mixed feeling about recommending this to anyone for the reason that i know they will be disappointed in the end, but the show still deserved an 8 because of its strong 6 seasons even if it fails to retain that strength in the end."
2019-09-21,hannesweiss86,Season 8 ruined the whole Series,10,"i loved the show, i loved to rewatch all the seasons up until i've seen season 8. now i don't want to rewatch it, because i know how it ends.
season 8 ruined it all for me.i would rate season 1,7 with 9-10 points (closer to 10 i think)
but with season 8 in mind i only give it a 7."
2014-01-05,andreas-flink,Game of Thrones,5,"quite a slow start in my opinion, but oh my mother of dragons it became good! i could make a list of perfect things in this tv,series so long so you had to sleep before you were done reading, but i'll keep it short! the acting was so freaking good, especially from jack gleeson (joffrey baratheon) whose head you want to crush until there's no life left of him. then the music - so excellent! when i first heard it it was almost as if i got goosebumps. well, it doesn't surprise me now, when i've seen how perfect everything is in this tv-series. when i first started watching this show i wasn't satisfied, but that was mainly because i watched like 10 minutes and wasn't patient at all. my friends and my brother made me give it another try so i did, with the thoughts of negativity towards the show. but the more i watched, the more i saw what a masterpiece of a tv-series this was. now i've even bought the books in hope of one day read through them all... (halfway through the first one at the moment). can't wait to see how it all turns out in the end!"
2019-05-20,alawa_2003,Great journey with a satisfied result but in a bad way,10,"no spoilersproducers and writers talked alot about great and massive ""smart"" twists in the final episodes, they took our expectations too high, sadly i didn't find any smart things here, especially with the weak writing and directing of season 8 episode 5 (the bells).the whole season 8 was fast in a bad way.however although, i am really satisfied with the result of how the show ended up and after a great 8 years journey now i can find myself give this show 8 out of 10 and definitely will miss this show."
2012-01-04,willdotcom79,Stunning portrayal,10,"this adaptation (so far) is without a doubt the best i've ever seen. few books ever make the transformation from script to screen without loosing something monstrously important to whomever has read it and taken it to heart. we can all reel them off. the beach for me ... what a pity. but hbo really have pulled it out of the bag with game of thrones. the sets, characters and costumes are perfect, they've even kept huge segments of dialog exactly the same.got almost plays out like a medieval polecat thriller, with a hint of fantasy. if you're after a lord of the rings type saga, you're going to be disappointed, only until you realise the plot is so thick and rich, you'll be on amazon 5 minutes later ordering the books to find out what happens next. i'm on book 3 and hand on heart, i think it's one of the best stories ever told.i dare anyone not to enjoy this epic medieval drama."
2020-04-08,sahib84,Great show but,1,seasons 1 to 6 were brilliant. please remake season 7 and 8
2014-09-06,pjcorten-278-661234,Depravity and debauchery par excellence,10,and a bit sloppy here and there. such as for example when the king offers wine to the hand and the latter resists the offer insisting he isn't thirsty. when their conversation concludes and the king heads for the exit the hand takes another awkward slug of the wine he had previously declined. granted it's picayune but it struck a false note within the context of the action. that said i must admit that the thing is hard to stop watching not exactly like having one potato chip more like rubber necking at the scene of an accident. with a boatload of gratuitous sex (including full frontal nudity male and female) and violence this is definitely fare for adults only.
2019-06-21,jcvagabond,One of the best shows on TV- Would triumph if the ending was different,10,could of been the greatest show ever but only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because of final few episodes. so dissapointed but still one of the best.
2018-01-28,yannig-307-950125,They Killed the Show and now it sucks,8,"they started the show with intrigue and adventure with good guys and bd ones. now? it's just a bunch of random bits that don't have you caring about or wanting any of the characters to win. the only character worth anything is tyrian lannister.  twelve seconds of khaleesi and her dragons doesn't make a medieval storyline. 
the first three seasons were really good. season four not so good. season 5? i'm not sure i'll continue to waste my time"

2012-10-09,michaelshotton,Wow.... Simply.... WOW!,1,"okay so i'll start by saying that this programme is not something i would normally watch.... i first came across ""game of thrones"" when someone posted on their facebook page that they were watching it. i then looked it up and it had such a good rating on imdb i decided to watch it myself. i went to my local tesco and found season 1 and purchased it. i didn't think i'd be much into it, but after half of episode 1, i found myself hooked. i feel the same way after every episode. i wan't more and more and more. i've just recently purchased season 2 and plan to start watching it very soon..... if you're reading this and haven't seen game of thrones yet.... watch it!!!!!!"
2019-05-20,samtorreslpn,Ending on a stumble,10,years of setup and smart thoughtful writing to be ended with what felt like a paper that you forgot was due tomorrow. storylines completely ignored. tone of character and season changes. the entire last season is a drag. prior to the last season the series is a 9/10.
2019-05-20,dt-dogukan,After so many years,2,after so many years we watch this series with passion love and breathless at the very end the writers kill this show. did anyone underatand what happened at the end? they just not only kill the best serie ever they ripped of every single seconds of it. my point was ten before de 8. season. after that i can only give 1. i am so dissappointed... so angry.... bruh!
2019-05-14,ludsanda,Might have been one of the best series ever...,10,unfortunately was ruined by lame script writing in seasons 7 and 8.
2012-08-11,dylanmannerslolley,By Far The Best Thing On TV,10,"(this is a review for all the seasons so far with no spoilers)when i sat down to watch ""a game of thrones"" i honestly thought it would be a second rate lord of the rings. boy was i wrong. this show has quickly become not just my favorite tv show but one o my favorite sources of entertainment in film music and tv. the story is very interesting with now section over explained or under,explained. the characters are incredible (my favorite has to be tyiron) and you find your self caring or characters or hating characters.this show will have you laughing crying and even shouting at your tv screen shout ""kill the little s*** kill him"" (or is that just me)"
2019-05-27,mmad_shinoda,Cuz i enjoyed the first 6s,7,i can live with it 10 for first 6th seasons and i will wait for rr books ending and thats it the show deserved the 10 even with d&d hard work to screw it with season 8 and in less degree season 7
2014-07-31,vasa-pavic951,The series which will define a generation!,7,"every generation had a defining series, but this one has game of thrones. a fantastical world of westeros, not unlike our own medieval europe, is beset by different problems and riddled with court intrigue as well as plots. families struggle either to maintain their position or to dominate westeros. the soundtrack is excellent, the story,line and narrative is superb, the characters are fully three-dimensional, morality is realistic and the show's many plot-twists are shocking, yet realistic enough not to cause the ""shock for shock-value's sake"" feeling. actors, although many are not well known, are memorable and they possess some real acting skill. simply an excellent, tense series keeping you constantly on the edge."
2013-08-08,ste-gormo,Probably TV's Finest Show,10,"game of thrones is easily one of the best shows on tv at the moment along with breaking bad, and is perhaps one of the finest ever. the detail is incredible and every episode is superb. peter dinklage is entertaining as are the rest of the cast, but with such great detail into the whole world of westeros it's easy to understand why every character is so enigmatic and wonderful, whether their evil like the tyrannical king joffrey or kind-hearted like emelia clarke's daenerys targaryen. season 1 is probably it's best so far, but with episodes like 'blackwater' and 'the rains of castamere' each season is assured to be a thrilling watch, worthy of your attention. any show that can fearlessly kill off some of its best characters and maintain the same level of class like game of thrones does deserves attention and this series, despite taking a while to reach a pivotal point, is continually intense and never, ever boring."
2021-03-21,jenniferdrogell,So good,9,"brilliantly plotted and executed story, incredible actors and acting. blew us away. well worth watching. one of the best things i've watched on tv or screen."
2019-02-07,engputer,A TV Show Impacts the human being for the next 20 years,9,"to be honest, at first i can't really understand why the show is good. i even made a post on my personal blog saying the show lacks of newbie tutorials, especially for those having hard time remembering faces and names. after watching the show twice, after watching the video reviews form the youtube, i gradually understand that every details in this show matters, containing abundant information out there. so for me, the 1st time i was like: it's a good one; the 2nd time i was like: breath,taking. now i am on my 3rd time. subscribe hbo and watch it!"
2019-05-24,rodrigo-akira-1990,D&D ruined this,1,"good show but bad writing for the last 2 seasons.seasons 1,6 were great, i'd give it a 9.5but season 7-8 were really awful.. really bad writing.. too much fan service and plot armor, ridiculous battle strategies, and rushed story.too bad, it would be a top 5 show if it wasn't for the ending"
2020-03-17,elmantoool,Great series,1,"having not watched any season previously. i just watched the entire series in one go and loved it. the 8th season was great but was going too fast. they've could've extended the season into 2 more i suppose. even the episodes duration were much longer. despite all the criticism, i loved the ending. i give it 9/10"
2018-08-11,iamgyan94-495-974305,This is mount Everest of TV series,5,"obviously you know or heard about mount everest... highest mountain peak in the world and everyone desires to climb up on it. that's the place of game of thrones in tv world. no other show i repeat no other show is like this one... it's the just best. you will find everything hear... the cgi, action, emotions, excitement, terror, love, hate, betrayed , sex etc. everything you know or you desire to experience.... i never read the book nor i intend to.... but this show is even greater than movies.... lord of the rings look likes a kid before game of thrones and that's not exaggeration... or may be a bit... but you gotta give it a time. waiting for finale."
2017-08-29,kevmanwilly-513-326536,No spoilers!,5,"where do i begin? goes the old song lyric. .. got,a song of fire & ice is the greatest show i have ever seen. a landmark in visceral, intelligent, savage entertainment, it is without equal. ""but it's got dragons!"" spout the uninitiated, but leave preconceptions by the door of your home & immerse yourself in the seven kingdoms and you will not regret it.i think i shall use this show to assess people- if you don't like it, why would we ever want to know one another? for you would have no heart, soul or pulse to derive enjoyment from politics, thrills, love, sex, gore, monsters, humour and often magnificent acting. appearances by jonathan pryce, jim broadbent and the greatest of all, diana rigg, speak volumes. 10/10 & faultless, it's my favourite tv of 40+ years. class."

2019-04-22,dphigham,The biggest nosedive in television history.,10,"i can't put into words my disappointment after viewing the first two episodes of the final seasons but i'll give it a go.the characters that grrm gave us have all had their flaws and dirt under their fingernails, and as a result we had no clear heroes or villains just a web of complex characters who were relatable in one way or another.. they felt real. since the source material has been overtaken we now have a standard fantasy series of good guys versus bad guys. dialogue that was once rich and fascinating has become difficult to listen to with a horrible predictability, cheesy one liners and saccharine sweet budding romances. the story is being butchered into small easy to swallow sound bites and i'm not holding out hope for the remainder of the series. my rating for the series on the whole will remain a 10/10 due to the incredible ride it has taken me on but i just felt compelled to air my sense of dissatisfaction. martin has created a vast world with incredible history to be explored in future projects roberts rebellion, the doom, the children of the forrest, the long night, dunc & egg and so on. i just hope we don't have more producers and writers having to take the reigns from martin again.as a fan of the source material i will continue to be enthralled and watch any attempts to bring his visions to life."
2019-05-20,nabilwadi1912,Soothing Finale,8,"poetic endings are scarce and i don't want to debate on which is which. but there is a thing in common between got and poi, that's the music composition of ramin djawadi.as for a single episode segregated from the entire series, this was too good to begin with. as for the series finale, i second kit harington that it will divide the fanbase. the ending was beautiful to some extent, though it required an illogical or rushed background story to make it look better. maybe a bit disappointing if your expectations were based on extreme order or extreme chaos.however, didn't occur to me as a bittersweet ending as we were informed. rather this was a proper conclusion to let us comprehend the reality of the human civilizations. things change and big things happen, yet the nature of humankind stays the same and it keeps going on and on.one story ends and gives way to another. and now our watch has ended.s08e06 grand finale"
2018-09-25,theghost1803,Such Amazing Series ever,8,"the series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. george martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. martin has stated that ""the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and dark lords, but from ourselves."
2019-10-03,pgk176,Don't watch the last season. Wait for half a decade after watching the first 7 seasons to see the better continuations as authored by GRR Martin himself,1,"just look at the ratings of each of the episodes of all seasons. none of the episodes before the 8th and final (i hope not) season received an overall rating on imdb, below 8.0
look at the 8th season. all of the episodes received ratings below 8.0
how i arrived at my ratings: 10 x 7 = 70, 0 x 1 = 0, (70 + 0) / 80 = 8.75 ~ 9
that's right. 8th season rating: 0
other season's ratings: 10 on 10now about the show: if you like mahabharata, but wanted to see some real on,screen action, more than the old dd show, get inspired from this show and make one. you will then be regarded as the greatest director/producer ever.george r r martin, the author of the series 'a song of ice and fire', can be regarded as the vyasa maharishi of the 21st century."
2019-05-30,sacredduniya,Extremely disappointed with the season finale,10,"can't say i hate the show ! loved it till the final season! with a ending like this , doesn't deserve over 9 . hence 1it had so much potentials! the background stories were amazing! it could have ended better! at least it needed few more seasons and explanations!utterly gutted"
2019-05-22,moka-sherif,"Great show, Questionable Ending",5,"incredible show! enjoy the ride as best as you can and do not rush! throughout the show, you will grow to hate and love characters. you will watch them face incredible odds, fail and also have victories. acting is good. the score is impressive and immersive. it always felt like the show had a bigger purpose and the final season was supposed to convey that. unfortunately, there really was no bigger purpose. one of the main mysteries/storylines about the show had no purpose even though it really was set up to matter at some point. we spent years listening to conversations from characters explaining their motives but suddenly in the final season no one gave any convincing explanation for anything at all. it's riddled with plot holes and instead of explaining our questions, it left us with more questions. not the kind that makes you think, but the kind that makes you think the writers really messed up."
2019-05-23,hellzking,Best TV series ever.....then Season 8 came,10,"wouldn't have thought it would be possible for any other tv series to ever be this good, it was a struggle to even find faults in it till the end of season 7. and then the creators decided to flush it all down the toilet and show the fans the middle finger so they could move on to star wars and gave us the absolute dung show that was season 8. they made all the intricate stories they built up over 7 seasons completely pointless and a waste of time. what was the point of knowing johns true heritage?what use was arya's use of becoming faceless woman?3 eyed raven completely useless and unnecessarymountain more of a threat than the night kingdaenerys u turn with barely any reasonsnights watch pointless with no wildlings and white walkersi could go on and on about what a disaster this show was in the end. ruined it completely for me and everyone i know and millions of loyal fans! only giving it a 7 due to how good it used to be and could have been, was a 10 before for me"
2013-08-08,myfantasy-sk,The BESSSTTT Show on TV !!!!!!!!!!!,10,"really this is undoubtedly one of the best shows ever made .. take my word . you wont regret watching it .. even though you feel like killing the writer of the book at times and stop watching the series because of some sadistic episode , you just cant stop it , it leaves you wanting for more...right now everyone is impatiently waiting for the next season to come out .. i hope there were more episodes . i finished watching the whole series within just two weeks ...i really have to say that this show has an amazing cast.. some of the best actors who really deserve a loud round of applause"
2019-05-22,arjun392-626-593227,A fast paced ending slows down the wheel that was already built,1,"game of thrones , the phenomenon that engulfed my undergrad and grad years. the thing that made it so fascinating was the multi-pronged story telling of one grrm in a fantasy world filled with magic, dragons, violence, betrayals and white walkers. for about 65 episodes, the white walkers were seen as the real threat to the kingdom and yet it took only 1 long drawn episode to stop them - it was like there was just too much build up for so little in the end. most of the story arcs from the initial seasons didn't even matter - season 8 could have easily happened in season 1 and we could have had a mediocre series altogether.the plot was lost when the tv series overtook the books - the writers had to make up their own stories and though some were wonderfully crafty and well written, there were a few stories out there that didn't make the mark. you cannot however under appreciate the cinematography, the music, the costume design and the production design on set - these were spot on and hbo cares for every small detail out there.downgrading my initial rating from 10 to 8 due to a disappointing end - starting from season 6 to 8. the starks were the real winners and imho, tyrion won the game of thrones by manipulating everyone. as varys once said, ""there are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. the king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget"""
2012-12-01,cinetech,Filth added to a story that doesn't need it...,10,"i am beginning to think that when hbo or showtime makes a new series, no matter what it's about, they get together and discuss how much graphic sex they can add to titillate the viewers...""game of thrones"" is a very rich and complex story, so what's with all of the x and sometimes xxx rated stuff that they ad to it...it's such a shame to see a piece of good and well made storytelling adapted to the screen, only to have it ruined by material that it just doesn't need....i can understand that producers realize that by putting in graphic sex scenes, that viewers will tell their friends and they will thus get more viewers,but this is really a crying shame that they have added it to this complex story...a shame..."
2016-11-05,dennisblogan,Garbage!,9,"i have tried to watch this show more than once and i just can't see what is great about it. i love fantasy, examples dungeons and dragons, conan and many others, and this is not fantasy whatever people say. this is a political show with a fantasy setting in that it has dragons and a few mythical races and beasts. my biggest dislikes are that there is not enough swordplay and there is too much sexuality. by sexuality i mean incest (more than once a brother and sister), a lot of nudity, and sexual acts galore. i am not a prude, but if i can't watch this with a teenager in the room without giving them bad ideas or having to discuss sex then i can't watch it. i am sorry that all you die hard fans don't see it the way i do but everybody is allowed to have their own opinion. before i forget, there are multiple rape scenes too i should mention. oh yes, i love watching a rape scene with my teenage niece, not!"
2020-06-26,caremale3,Just kills off your favorite character,9,killing is the only thing the writers do to make the story seem exciting. everyone will be dead by the time this whole thing is over i assume. don't binge watch this. this show is too vile and violent to binge watch.
2020-07-08,caremale3,Visually impeccable,1,i wish so many of the characters i liked didn't die so often. but that's life. i like george rr martin. he's forward thinking. death is a part of life. many good and evil people die throughout life.
2021-01-30,ladybug06,"Final season spoilt the overall impression, do not watch it",1,"i know a zillion people already expressed my opinion, but decided to put in a word, too. yes, i also spent my time and some money watching all the episodes, waiting, trying to guess, thinking about the jon snow dilemma... and the final season spoilt the whole overall impression, to the extent where whatever was good there in the previous seasons, does not matter. we waited for 2 years for that final season. and what we got was... many words have been said about it.
game of thrones set a high standard for tv series, it is a historic show; but it also got to history as the show that spoilt everything with the final season the worst way.
game of thrones is a great example how a bright global show can turn into nothing, and the worst thing , the film makers blame the audience that they did not understand or like it properly.
game of thrones is an example how you can take the attention of millions, use it, and then throw it away without even thinking about it.
whoever is thinking about watching game of thrones - you can watch it, but do not watch the final season, do not go there."

2015-07-31,palockwood,Has been excellent but 2015 a let down,4,"i've not read the books.someone at work got me on to this when season 3 was on. i caught up from the very beginning and watched the last episode of season 3 the night it was aired.totally hooked on the show and eager to watch each episode as it was aired.2015 held high hopes and i already knew after watching episode 1 and throne cast on sky that the writers hadn't written ahead for the tv series so stories were changing. the 2015 season did have some great story lines, but it didn't capture you like the previous seasons. no mention of the 3 eyed raven at all in the whole season. when it finally finished i was left without that same feeling of wanting the next season to appear so quickly. i think the screen writers have now spoilt the series and although i would continue to watch them until they finally wrote of the series it wouldn't bother me now if the series is shelved.lets just hope that they up the game in 2016 and concentrate on the storyline rather than the special effects."
2018-08-08,jcb0409,GOT ruined TV for me!,6,"ever since i've watched the last available season of got i haven't been able to get into any other show. i've tried countless new shows and nothing even comes close to got! the way the multiple story lines and characters intertwine with one another is absolutely genius! the idea that someone created this entire world from their imagination is unbelievable. the acting is suburb and you can't help but to fall in love or despise the characters. the cinematography and cgi is stunning. you'll be completely immersed in westeros! wishing you could just jump in and be a part of the story! so many twist and turns and things you'd never expect. got is incredible and definitely worth your time! however, be warned! once you start you won't be able to stop and tv will never be the same!"

I liked it!?,1,"all i really want to say about game of thrones is that i love it! i really didn't think i would. i'm normally not in to the fantasy type stuff. when trees started walking in lord of the rings, i walked away from my tv! its also safe to say i am now totally in love with daenerys(emelia clarke)another thing i love about got is the emotions it seem to evoke! i found myself genuinely angry after season 3 episode 9 and had to take some time to calm down!! why did i care so much!? the characters are amazing, you find yourself really rooting for certain people, and actually caring about others, and of course hoping others get what they deserved!i normally like to save tv series up and watch them at my own pace, but with this i have to watch each episode as soon as its on tv! the only reason this doesn't get 10 stars from me is because i still can't fully get over the fantasy bits, fire gods, monsters north of the wall etc i clearly just don't have the imagination!"
2013-06-28,korrathedarkspirit,"Predictable, unnecessary nuance.",10,"i used to really love this show when it first came out but after season 3...""the red wedding"" specifically, i've really grown to despise it. its completely predictable and the change in tone doesn't help either. the characters feel under,developed and the atmosphere is not as chilling as it used to be! what i hate most is the abysmal, unnecessary violent nature it seems to be portraying. was there any need to kill 'that' many characters in the red wedding? no.it used to be a well written, well crafted show but now it has turned into something sadistic and completely unimaginative. i give it a 3 only because of the well done special effects."
2013-07-04,tmntshow,I hate this show. ABYSMAL!,7,"absolutely hated seasons 2 & 3. the show seemed like it was going somewhere with season 1 which had a well written plot and characters but that all goes down the drain after the season 1 finale! sean bean was seriously miscast. in fact, most of the actors are miscast and do a terrible job! i mean, have you seen the ""red wedding""? that's when i dropped the show as it just got too ridiculous and derivative. the battles are too cliché and just lord of the rings rip,offs! even if they are rip-offs, they can still be handled well but after season 2...complete garbage! yeah, game of thrones sucks! :("
2019-05-22,alecchase3,A flawed beast. Not unlike life.,10,"you will read a lot of people here you that the last two seasons are subpar and while maybe in terms of attention to detail, they would be correct, most certainly they are wrong when it comes to spirit.the ending of this show actually stays very true to the rest of the show. in the final episode, after some insane events depicted in the last few seasons, chaos is finally replaced by normality.but normality isn't what everyone was expecting, it isn't what everyone wanted, but it is without a doubt, the most fitting end to the series, easily.please, don't listen to all these people giving the show a ""tarnished"" rating like a 3 or 4 because of the end. it is minimum an 8. outstanding, great, and thought provoking, this show will change what you thought possible from a tv show.a brilliant adaptation, that is by no means perfect, but then again, what is ever perfect. it's flaws are what make it what is is, and i don't mean flaws like in ""the last of the starks"" i mean the flaws of the characters.thanks for your time."
2019-05-26,theunknownpurpose1,Best show ever!,10,"so, i watched the first episode when it came out and couldn't go past the first episode. i wasn't into the hype and thought it was overrated. couple weeks ago i decided to try this show again since i haven't met anyone who dislikes it. i finished the whole series in three weeks and this is the best show i have ever seen in my whole entire life. i really don't think anything will top this show. my ratings for each season. season 1 : 7/10
season 2: 8:10
season 3: 8/10
season 4: 8.5/10
season 5: 6/10
season 6: 9.5/10
season 7: 10/10
season 8: 9/10overall i think this show is 10/10 regardless what people say about season 8. i'm really gonna miss this show :(if you haven't watched got, do your self a favor and go watch it now!!!"
2013-07-31,edwardwll,Not even close to braveheart - i don't like GOT that much,7,"before everybody watched got, my brother told me that i woudnt like it because it is too slow. at some point a girl told me that i had to watch it. i did like it but i did agree with my brother. it is too damn slow. season 1 starts off pretty cool, but during that season u never really see the ""things"" u see in the first few minutes of season 1after season 1 i was hoping for the big battle coming in season 2, the big build towards the big fight. when season 2 ended i started to dislike this series. just because nothing happened in season 2. really, ppl always go crazy when i say that. the fight in season 2 was nothing, because it was a failed attempt, so it didn't chance much in the story (and they didn't even show anything cool during that fight). only the end of season 2 is kinda cool and makes u want to watch season 3. season 3... well im still disappointed. i hoped for so much more! at least it was much better than season 2. having ""the red wedding"" as biggest happening in season 3, is kinda lame. yes some main characters die but it was kinda predictable and not close compared to the biggest event in a series like ""dexter"" or ""super natural"". in my opinion: , got is way too slow (maybe this is because in real life nothing happens really fast, i don't know but its not fun to watch). i think seeing kalesi during 2 scenses in 1 episode for only 1 minute where she doesn't really do anything, isn't that interesting. - got is too predictable. so far i could predict a lot. yes of course i didn't know about the thing with ""jaime lannister"" or with ""eddard stark"" but most of it is just too simple. - got has no (fun) action. there are no big battles, like in lotr. there are not even cool small fights. i think that is a much in this type of series/movie.i told my story to a friend who is a big fan, he is reading all the books etc... i told him that he should pick a random episode from season 2 or 3 and that he should write down everything that happened in that episode. he did and he said that it was quite a list. so when i saw what he wrote down, i started to laugh, stuff like: ""joffrey got send to his room"". maybe thats the first that he isn't really the boss, but in every episode before that one, was it leading towards that same thing. also tyrion lannister kinda did it multiple times. it isn't a big event, maybe its important for the story but that doesn't make it that big of a deal, specially when its done before and predictable. ppl tell me that i just don't get it and that the politics are really important. got isn't hard to understand (thats not something negative). braveheart has so much more of everything. even though i don't like it that much, i still think got is a must see. just because everybody is watching it and because its still fun to watch. its just not that great as everybody thinks it is (opinion, i guess)"
2020-04-19,luis151,I still give it a 10,10,"just because there are 6 outstanding seasons of great dialogue, amazing acting and brilliant world building.unfortunately there's two seasons left.during season 7 you notice something is different. characters dont take their time anymore, all the sharp dialogue from previous seasons seems to be gone but you still can enjoy this season for its action sequences and great set pieces.and then there's season 8.all the time you dedicated to these characters seems wasted because there is no logic left, no arcs resolved and no questions answered and for the first time in my life i fell asleep during the final episode just to show you bad it got.still the 6 seasons are very much worth of your time and perfect on their own."
2014-09-04,raheembutt07,Not enough male nudity and gay sex,4,".....contains some spoilers.......game of thrones is such an amazing show packed full of extreme violence, gore, drama, sex, which i love. but i have only have one criticism.... no male nudity!! every time i watch the show, all i see are women's privates and breasts. helooooo, penis!!!! where is the male nudity? i think the only problem with the she show is that there needs to be more naked men, more penises, more hot male chests and buttocks to make the show more fair to men. the show contains too much female frontal nudity but not enough male nudity. i want to see some!!! also, game of thrones contains all types of sex: anal, lesbian, incest, rape and prostitution but there is no gay sex. i wanna see more men and men in bed. there was a scene in ""kissed by fire"" where loras and olyvar had sex. that scene was so hot. olyvar's body was so hot and he had an amazing bum. also in series 4, olyvar was naked in bed with prince oberyn. we got to see his sexy hot ass, sexy chest and his penis as he left the room. those were the only two main gay scenes in game of thrones and that is ridiculous. to conclude, i think there is too much female nudity and not enough male and i want to see more gay sex scene as i believe these two factors will make the show much fairer and better to watch."
2014-04-11,bkinch29,Awesome show,10,"this is a great show! there is so much to talk about. the acting is stellar, the sets, locations, costumes, etc, are just awesome. warning, do not watch if you are 12 and under or not a fan of violence, sex or anything pertaining to that. this show is packed full of violence- and i mean extremely. for example (spoiler)- there is a pregnant woman stabbed in the uterus, and is very disturbing to watch; also there is a man who gets his nipple cut off (not that gory but very unnerving). there is also a lot of blood- whether through stabbings or slitting of throats or whatever. there is also a lot, and i mean a lot, of boobs and sex. there are many prostitutes who show boobs and women who aren't prostitutes who show their boobs. the sex also is very graphic. in the first season, there is a group of people, a few of the main characters are with, who have sex just out of the blue. you can also see a little bit of penises here and there but nothing full on. it is still a great show and has lots of plot twists and many likable and unlikable characters- and is all around a great show. it is base off the book series, which are just as good, by george r r martin."
2019-07-08,lovelykhan_u,Finale,10,game of thrones finale sucks the end was totally meaningless very disappointed to watch such a great series end like this they could have done that better ways but ..... it sucks
2014-06-09,multitaskmachine,Every climax in every episode leaves me hanging,1,"this show deserves 10 stars, and if i could give it 10+ stars then i would. its the only show so far i have seen which leaves me hanging till next episode and so on. this show is a complete marvel. and all the characters have portrayed their roles very well and so is the presentation of the show. the story is pure ungodly in nature, something i've never seen or cant think of. and so is the execution of this story. i am amazed who's gonna win the game of thrones at last?i recommend this show to anyone who wants some real steel. but beware, don't start loving the characters or you'll cry in pain like me!!!"
2020-10-11,cwm276-839-571226,I refuse to believe that I used to Love this show.,10,if you treat season 8 as parody then you get a pretty good series .
2019-05-25,aglezthewizard,Certainly something unfortunately disappointed....,10,"i could not say that this story taught us something, because since it started it was full of intrigues, envies, hatreds and crimes, but it certainly shows you something in itself, and it is the hatred or the discomfort and the annoyance of the screenwriter to make some resolution to so much calamity .... the story began and all of us who follow this plot of fatalities hope for justice and this did not happen only in one or two chapters, i do not think anyone will see it in the future and that is a great pity because there are very good actors. i give 4 stars for the actors and the screenplays"
2018-09-07,kevin_sleeking62-875-597971,This is a masterpiece,10,from the beginning i was hooked you got everything you need here to have the perfect show shows like this come once in a life time
2018-11-16,andrewkenwood46,It can't and won't get better then this.,10,this is the best show ever made period. anyone who says different obviously lives on a different planet. the acting is amazing the story is so damn perfect. everything from the cgi to the extras... this show is the goat. if you haven't already done so give it a go but don't start if you don't have at least 6 hours to burn because you won't want to stop watching..
2019-05-13,zz-883-759397,S8 dropped the ball on storytelling..,10,it's so sad to see them drop the ball on storytelling in the final season. this gives me some dexter ptsd..
2014-01-13,michaelm-atky,Dark And fantastic,8,"for those who don't know by now the game of thrones on hbo is a tv adaption of george r.r. martin's books, a song of ice and fire.if you've never read or watched fantasy and you hate the genre you should give a game of thrones a chance anyway because unlike most fantasy books and shows this isn't packed with magic and magical creatures expect for the ""others"" and one or two other creatures this series is more like a drama/thriller with plenty of backstabbing,double and triple crosses the political intrigue will leave you wanting more and more.for those who think the story line is too complex it shouldn't be it's actually quite simple and clean.yes there are a lot of characters to keep up with but once you've watched the first season you will slide into to it comfortably.only advice i can give someone who is watching for the first time is to start with season 1 episode 1 because you will be lost if you don't.ps:i would try not to get too attached to any ""one"" character. in other words try and pick out four or five to be your favorite......"
2016-05-27,panmpap,One of the Greats,10,"i am fan since 2012. right now in my early 20s, i remember here in london what was happening about this tv show. i had heard that it contained a lot of sex and violence. however, i gave it a shot to see if it was truly so good. after i watched the first episode, i was literally amazed by what had happened. but as the story progressed, and i was shocked for the first time with ned stark's death, i understood that it was serious business. the acting is superb even by young actors and actresses that are just in their teenage years. after the first season, i learnt that the series are based on book series. i picked them up, read them and they were absolutely sensational. but, we are here to review the show and not the books. so, the struggle for power and survival makes the show a joy to watch. surely, some people may not like the violence for anything else that is included in the show, but is surely worth watching and should be considered as one of the best tv shows of all time."
2017-07-02,timsjelwt,Game Of Thrones:The kidnapping and butchering of a genre:The fantasy series.,9,"this series,is such a huge success because it deliberately revives and confirms male patriarchal stereotypes and general nihilistic views on masculinity.in a time where young men have lost their sense if purpose;what is it nowadays to be a man?this is medieval times recreated with more war and more nihilism.the fantasy element is added with 3 dragons and a little bit of magic. next to that the deliberate creation of (by now quite boring repetitive predictable (with a""k"") shock effect every season by showing the hacking of heads and limbs""see guys; in days of old real men showed no mercy.""and next to that a cast of almost all unlikable opportunistic characters.only jon snow i'd blow:)but who wouldn't? with the mother of dragons joining in of course,o.k boys?:) certainly most the closeted imdb gaming nerds that adore this show so,would join.those that seem to have kidnapped the sf, fantasy ratings of imdb anyway:)oh yeah.. diana riggs oleana tyrell is somebody i would have a cup of tea with. anyway i digress.next to that the psychology is very flat.because most of these types are vile,disrespectful, not so sensitive twats (m/v) whom we frankly, as the seasons progress, get no true insight into; motivation wise.why care?problem is there are too many characters in the first place.and they all seem to have the same bloody hollow ambitions. as of yet our dear writer has not granted us any solace any hope of any sort of psychological release.and we're in season 6 of 7, mind you, of mister martin's ""provocative"" nihilism; i say why don't they just all butcher each other! which they probably will in the end ! see if i care!.:) it's all gone much too far without having anything significant to say about humanity.whilst fantasy should provide us with alternative views and values.and could really blow our minds.here it merely serves to confirm the hopelessness of the man race:) in short:overrated by imdb gaming computer nerds and south park loving autistic sissy boys that do not know where to stick it anymore:)all a bunch of vagrant crybabies that wouldn't even be able to handle a sword,they'd probably hack of their own toes.fitting actually:) toodles.....:)"
2020-03-21,tripleamovie-914-455706,S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 And S8 Are Masterful Entertainment!,10,"now that months upon months have finished. i'm ready to express my pleasure and overall some what spoiler free review on this series. it's a 10/10 for me. from the fandom and fan doom. to my heights of joy and despair. i loved living in the age of premium tv when thrones aired. it was a true joy. i would like to separate what seasons were the best to me. thrones had a beginning, middle and end. and naturally one stood out more then the other and it makes sense.at 8th place is season 5. how dose a season compet after season 4. it just cant. so many reasons why especially as the middle act was now passing. still great tv and great thrones. yet it was setting up towards the last stretch a bit more and was getting out of the middle of the story. of course hard home and the final two episodes of that season were some of the best thrones had to offer.at 7th place is season 7.
this was really the season that brought to our attention that thrones was heading to the finish line. the story was straightening and the film structure was starting to as well. it was still natural and in alot of ways it felt more flowing then season 5 or even the worst one for flow, season 8. but still, it was exciting and stirred the emotions.6th place is season 2.
the battle of black water was an amazing episode. the sher character development of season 2 is also some the best you can see on film. it's also an excellent example of thrones in full drama and mystery.5th place season 8.
all men must die, just as all series must die. what controversial season. but dont let that deter you. this season was not as perfect as the rest in alot of ways, but was perfect in just ending things on an epic note. yes it was rushed here and there, and you felt it. but it was also made that way with purpose. its fitting how season 8 felt. like the show was quickly and violently expiring our hope's and expectations on arcs and plots. it finished unapologetically and in our face. that was always going to be more important then all our expectations. because this show or even the books never cared about our expectations. just killing them then ending. it had to come to an end quickly and everyone was not going to get the end they deserved. that's also just a thrones thing.4th place season season 1.
the perfect start of an epic is what you have here. with twists and turns coming right from the get go. easley the best season one of any drama. and set a standard for the rest of the thrones seasons to fallow.3rd place is season 3.
season 3 is cruel and enticing entertainment. it's true thrones minute by minute. also has one of the most dramatic game changers in the history of storytellings of heros and villains. a scene so powerful it will stay with you the rest of the series.2nd place is season 6.
for the most part, season 6 is just a good thrones season with great moments like within the door episode and ect. but what shoots this season straight to 2nd place is the last two episodes, 9 and 10. thrones would never again have a 9 or 10 episode after this season, but it didn't matter because those two episodes were the best of the thrones pultamit and final 9 and 10 episodes. from then on though, the show started to feel as a pultamit and final show as a whole. season 6 still would also change alot of main characters arcs but with that excellent pace because it wasnt over yet.1st place is season 4.
the middle of a story is always the richest part. and thrones by the way it was written, the middle of the story is a gold mind. starting seconds after season 3 season 4 just takes a long burn through pain, betrayal, consequence, hope and the disparity of is characters. its thrones touching and shattering our hearts with a steady flow. the drama of these noble familys was at its absolute hight with new heros and villains showing up. and more death, lots more death. this was the season that we just didn't know what to expect, because of how the season ended before it. and yes all men must die, that was a season 4 land mark as well. this season easily became one of the most hardest seasons to predict and played with our nerves like no other. even knowing how everything plays out, this season is still a powerhouse to watch and helped set up a generation of fandom tv nerds like no other. once the middle of the story is over ofcourse the story is not. this middle chapter helped set up great stories and new character arcs for our heros and villains for us to fallow right down to the conclusion, like any middle chapter is supposed to do. we so much wanted to see how things turned out. how rewarding it would be as well. that doesn't change the fact that season 4 of game of thrones is the best of game of thrones. truly untouchable."
2015-05-12,lovesaroha,Not Good Now,10,"i have read the books (the first three i have read twice, the fourth once). i love the books. so in theory i am pre,disposed to either like the series or hate it because it is not sufficiently like the books. it would be damn near impossible for me to judge the series as if i had not read the books. i have only seen the first two episodes of the series.all that said, i love the series. the casting is phenomenal. the acting better than some of the best mini-series. tyrion is spot on (a phenomenal acting job and a phenomenal character). jon snow is spot on. arya stark, cersei lannister, jaime lannister etc, etc. the series clearly gives the feel for the book and is true in its characterizations. no series will have every plot detail of a book nor will it have every character exactly as every individual sees him/her, it can't, but this series is very true to the book, true to martin's writing and true to the character of each player. i can't wait for the next episode. i want to own the series on dvd (blu ray). i want to go back and read the books."
2014-06-16,superkootjee,One of the best series ever!,7,"this is truly one of the best, if not the best, tv,shows i have ever seen. it mixes great drama with powerful action. the actors are all very well casted and their performances are topnotch! the storyline is very fresh from other tv series, of course we all know that george r.r. martin kills a lot of main characters but that is what makes the series different, there are still lots of unexpected plot twists and great dialogues in this series. the only thing what keeps me from rating this series a 10 is the fact that they change directors every few episodes, all directors are great but they film in a different way therefor making each episode with a different director slightly ""different"" than the others.but this is still one of the best series ever made and i will encourage everyone to see it!"
2021-08-10,chalithafreeze,"This is the true meaning of ""Perfection""",10,"this is a full package. violence, love, sadness, happiness and almost every feeling of a person includes in this. please don't listen to the cowards that say the ending is bad. they say that because the ending didn't meet their expectations. give this a try, you'll definitely love this of you can bare unexpected things. finally ""winter is coming""."
2020-12-19,luke-wilson,Some shows stay with you... this sadly doesn't,8,"i find myself occasionally drifting in to a bit of a day dream and thinking about moments in shows and films that have really stuck with me; these are the shows that i will rewatch and look back on fondly and think of the journey i went on with the characters.game of thrones was on track to be one of these shows. however, the last season (arguably 2) has destroyed that for me and i am sure a lot of others. so rushed, characters suddenly changing character with no real reason why, other characters just thrown aside or forgotten. this leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and instead of looking back fondly i look back with regret that i wasted my time with the show."
2019-05-20,jrex1997,The best,10,"i don't even care about season 8. i didn't like the end but it will never change the fact that this series gave me all kind of emotions, shocked me and made me have as many goosebumps as never before. now the watch is ended and i really can't get enough.. #thankyougot"

2016-05-22,dmon_hunter,A must-watch,1,"the first time i tried to watch the show i wasn't impressed cause it seemed to evolve slow and i left it for a couple of months. after a while i forced my self to watch again since a friend of mine strongly recommended that i do... and damn was she right! this is one of the best tv series i have ever watched. brilliant! an emotional roller coaster. last episode i watched ""the door"" blew my mind. watch got. you will not be disappointed. great choice of actors and amazing performances. also the soundtrack is unbelievable, the atmosphere is great, the level of detail and story consistency are perfect. i recommend this to everyone."
2014-04-29,goldiecalf,Torturing Women is The New Normal. Sewer Material Served on Silver Platters.,1,"no other shows on tv celebrates female,torturing more enthusiastically than game of thrones. the got creators have elevated the spectacle of graphic female-torturing to a whole new politically correct level. not only it is okay to watch snuff porn in the comfort of your living room, it is now totally cool to yell down (and censor) anyone who dare say got glorifies misogyny.i don't mind some sex and nudity on tv, but perverse sadist crap that dehumanize the one already-over-dehumanized sex belongs in the sewer of internet porn. officially, got's contribution to artistic progress is making un-pc perversity the new pc-ness.congratulations got for elevating stinking sewer material to high heaven.obviously, got creators and fanatics reckon it's totally cool that women and little girls are repeatedly (in highly graphic details) psychologically tortured, insulted for their sex, publicly humiliated like slaves, stripped and displayed and auctioned off like meat on sticks, raped like sun-human, hunted down and slaughtered like animals, and their naked female flesh bloodily pierced with sharp weapons of all sorts. it doesn't matter who (male or female) is doing the torturing, females in this show are either tortured virgins, tortured whores, tortured and torturing bitches, or tortured dead meat. keyword is tortured. women must be tortured for the pleasures of got directors whose ambition is to play high budget porn director. and not just any porn mind you, but specifically maximum pain-inducing, maximum dehumanizing-effect kind of porn.of course they didn't stop at torturing women. men are tortured too. the ratio? about 9 women for every 1 man. women simply deserve more torture apparently. why? to reflect the world as is? or to reflect the overflowing sewer that is got creator's brilliant genius mind content?"
2019-04-10,dk2688,No words to describe this masterpiece,1,"game of thrones isn't just a tv series that's taken the world by storm since it's inception but, it's an emotion. thrones has set benchmarks in cinematography, stellar performances, marvellous background scores and a scintillating storyline which would be very hard to match in times to come. as thrones nears it's end with the final season coming up in a few days, the feelings are mixed. on one hand all got fans are curious to know who will win the great war between the living and the dead and on the other hand fans will see their favourite characters one last time. though every actor in thrones is an institution in oneself, and it's hard to pick one but it's the character of cersei lannister that i absolutely loath. i despise it so much that i'm actually in love with lena headey whose absolutely nailed it with her performance and it's a pity she hasn't won an emmy for this. if you truly despise a character so much it shows how good the actor is and lena perfectly sums up that. a man is eagerly waiting for got one last time."
2011-07-16,fleurcarpediem,Disappointing,10,"i literally just finished reading the book and loved every word! i cannot express how disappointed i am by the series. the acting is perfunctory, some of the locations are not at all correct and i really don;t understand why they had to play around with the dialogues so much!! you have an amazing book there which gives you everything you need and instead it has become a tapestry of scenes which don;t flow and do not convey any of the history or the background. some characters like varys and petyr baelish really lack that venomous, conniving (is that spelled correctly??) edge to them..same goes for cercei. i find khal drogo very disappointing..i would have expected a far larger and more robust man..and where are the bells??? intricate part of him and totally lacking..as well as the grassy plains and the whole 'important moments in a man's life should be done under the stars'. it's a shame.i would have thought a series rather than a movie would be the ideal carrier for such an amazing book but even though i have tried to watch it several times and come back to it several times, i am always disappointed."
2014-06-17,ayyylmao,wow... where to start?! One of the greatest shows of all time!,10,"exactly what my summary says... seriously, i could go on for hours about how great this show is and how just mind blowing it is. first of all it is based off of the series of books titled ""a song of ice and fire"" by george r r martin. these books are better than the show (like most books are) but this is one of the best adaptations of a book that i have ever seen. first things first the acting. the portrayal of these characters and the actors and actresses that play that have an immense amount of talent. even the children on the show know how to act and that just creates this show. the special effects are top notch and everything looks extremely realistic! the set design is beautiful, just to see this whole other world is truly amazing. the script is sophisticated and it comes together perfectly. and after all those amazing compliments its really hard to find a negative thing about this show because the twists and turns it creates always will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more!!!! this is another one of my must watch shows because its one of a kind. even though the nudity can get a little out of hand at points this show is one of the greatest shows of all time. i recommend this!"
2020-12-03,mprimdaal,Had to re-reveiw this show 8/10,5,"game of thrones was one of my absolute favorite shows, and i've been following got from season 2.my older rating was gem mint 10/10 masterpiece, but!i had to come back. this show is ""almost"" a masterpiece, it's different from other shows and brings a lot of interesting characters with some really great acting! also the costume designs and the cgi work is stunning. the story and plot is unpredictable and nail,biting. nothing is as it seems, got is a truly great show, and just inches away from a masterpiece.the show hat me hooked from season 1 to season 7, oh boy it's exiting. however the two year wait for season 8 was a bit much, also because it's the shortest season of them all. but on top of the long wait, season 8 was weird. it felt rushed, and character-development went 180. i know it may have resultet in a lot of pressure coming to end this show, giving it's one of the most popular shows of all time with different opinions and criteria. but i don't think the writers did the show justice. they rushed it, the ending is poor and it's so sad to give such a perfect show (season 1-7) such a poor ending. game of thrones went from being well written and unpredictable in the most exciting way possible, to poorly written and unpredictable in the very worst way possbile. it's tough to meet the expectations of the excitement you build. througout several seasons. but this show had every possibility to end amazing, with so many good and dark charters to play around with. but it feels rushed and unfinished.had to come back and re-review this show. 8/10 (given the poor ending)"
2019-05-21,electricspares,It's over,10,8 seasons of awesome fantasy drama (and yes that includes the last season) was it perfect? no. did it meet all expectations? no. did i like the way it ended? meh could have been worse but apart from one mopey faced character i was pretty happy.now onto the next 8 year obsession that everyone will think they could write better!
2019-05-20,pnijovg,They destroyed the spirit of the show,10,the last season is so bad it should have never been made. if i knew they were going to sh** all over the plot set in the song of ice and fire i would have never started watching it in the first place. horrible just horrible and pointless. random people of the street would have written a better ending to the show.
2020-01-29,kjena-u,Brilliant,10,i finished this series from start to ending! this show is stunning. the scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting.
2020-02-07,chrismavroudis,season 8,10,where is the final season? where is the mega fight? where is the dragon with daenerys?! why why why 6 episodes!?
2014-09-16,baekhoholic,"Game Of Thrones, what a show",10,"my review contain a huge amount of spoilers from both book and show be aware when reading:d i started to watch game of thrones after the fourth season had ended, cause i has wanted to watch it ever since i knew it about the storyline, it was a couple days after the third season had just finished that i found out it was not based in this world or time(aka : fiction and i love me some fiction). so after i found that out i went to its wikia page and there i saw a picture with dany and drogo it looked as if her boobs were being shown, i then went and looked up ""parental guide for game of throne"", to my knowing there was a huge amount of nudity and sex(me : since i am 14 i don't want to see that kinda stuff).so after the fourth season was done i looked at the parental guide on imdb and it said ""no nudity"" on the last episode, so i downloaded and watched it, i did not know who was who, what was what, where was where i only knew dany, sansa, and jon, i was so clueless before i thought jon falls in love with sansa, not knowing that its his half,sister and still i oddly liked the episode. so again i went to its wikia and and went to the first episode of the entire show(winter is coming) page and scrolled down and saw ""recap for winter is coming, scene by scene"" opened that, can back to imdb's parents guide read the nudity in episode one, read to recap over and over again tell a knew when and where the sex udity scene appears(in even the same second)and when it ended both pages(imdb guide and wikia's page. i finally had everything i need for my watching of the first 5 episodes of the first season i just need to download them, i downloaded them and i watched them (skipping the sex/nudity scenes) and i loved every minute of each episode i watched of game of thrones.now i am on season 4 episode 6, and so far my favorite characters are the golden twins(cersei and jamie lannister), tryion lannister, sansa and arya stark, jon snow, and daenerys targaryen(aka stormborn and shes my main favorite), reek(theon greyjoy), and last margaery tyrell.my favorite part about the show is it is not those book turned show where they changed so much about the show that it puts you off it, that never changed that much from the book and when you get a twist like if they do bring in what if jon snow is the bastard son of lyanna and rhaegar cause readers remember ned saying she ""died in a bed of blood"" and her last words were a promise she made him keep,a promise like protect my son, the people who say this theory isn't right bring that fact that he has a dire-wolf(sigil for house stark)but the people who believe its true give a fact cause since lyanna is ned starks full sister and he to would also have a wolf and all the other dire-wolfs(shaggy-dog, summer ,lady, grey wolf , and last nymeri ) all have dark like-fur because both of their parents tully and stark have dark hair, on the other hand ghost(jon snows dire-wolf)has white(a color often made with a targaryen features)fur and since the wolfs were made for stark children he to would get one since his mother is a stark if this theory is right, they also bring in that in order for you to have a surname if your a bastard you need to know where your mother is from (i.e. where the mother is from, not where the father is from. for example, a noble lord from the storm-lands could father one bastard child in the vale, and another in the river-lands, but neither would use the surname ""storm"": the first bastard would use the surname ""stone"", and the second would use the surname ""rivers."" credit to the wikia page for bastards ) jon snow, as a result of the mystery surrounding his mother's identity he came to use the name snow but ned didn't seem have a problem with this hence the idea he knows his sister is the mother to ""his"" supposed bastard son cause if it is her son he would use the name snow but not by default overall don't let nudity/sex, profanity get in the way of you watching the perfect show"
2017-02-07,gamer6713,The best TV show of all time. Do you want to know why?,10,"even if you don't watch ""game of thrones"" chances are you have probably a lot of friends who watch it and say that it is the best show that they have ever seen, and can't stop telling you about it. well i say that too, because i haven't seen anything close to it. first of all i have watched many tv shows, both that now i consider good and bad, and when i say a lot i mean it (the walking dead, breaking bad, arrow, sherlock, house of cards, true detective...). now i stopped doing that, because i realized i was wasting a lot of time watching tv shows. the only tv shows that i now watch are game of thrones and house of cards. i would say i have grown up a bit in 3 years, but i only see those tv shows worth spending my time on. now that i have told you my backstory i can start praising game of thrones, and saying how everything is perfect, except i will not do that. i will tell you what i think makes this show that good and why you should start watching it, but i will also focus a bit on the bad sides that there aren't many, but they have to be brought up in order for you to make a good judgement about it. if you are expecting a tv show just to spend your friday or monday night, entertaining yourself at the moment you won't get that with game of thrones. what you will get instead ""game of thrones"" is a big journey, full of carefully invented events and characters. the characters are psychologically well described, exactly like people in real life. each one of the characters has his goals, motivations, morals and specific mindset (way of thinking) that the show presents it to you in the best way possible. if you wan't to understand it better, you should read something on reddit or rewatch the show, because a lot more is going on than what you have noticed. it's made in a way that if you think and analyze the decisions of the characters you will end up predicting how they will act in the future, like a game of chess. it has a lot of plot twists that you will never expect and that will definitely shock you while watching it. the most important thing that makes me love this show so much is how realistic it actually is. but wait you will ask yourself this is a fantasy show isn't it? yes it is, because there is a world just for ""game of thrones"" , with specific history, geography, politics, holidays, and even the accents of characters who are from different places in westeros are specific. it has even two languages made just for the show with around 1000,3000 words. you can see the realism in the show, just from it's motto that it is ""all men must die"", meaning that everything can happen in the show just like in real life. there is not a main character that beats all the odds and lives happily forever after. no every character in ""game of thrones"" has it's good and bad sides, ups and downs, and most importantly everyone can die in any moment, there is not coincidences like in other movies or tv shows, where at the end the character will be saved by some miracle or a coincidence. the show doesn't have a hero, nor a villain, but it makes you decide for yourself who the hero is and who the villain is. what i think makes this show the best of them all is that it can be watched by any audience and still be enjoyed by everyone. whether you are an intellectual and a very educated person or not very much educated (no offense to anyone), this show has something for everyone. whether you are watching it for the dragons, the middle aged theme, the sexual scenes, or like me for the game of chess that's going on in it from the start, you fill find something that will hook you to it. i can promise you that! what i would say that people don't like much about it, it's the start of the show. it takes some time to meet and get to know the characters, and when you start, you will not have much to go on, but when you finish the first few episodes it just won't leave your mind. i want to thank you for reading this rather big review, but i think you will find it very helpful considering my experience with tv shows. and yes, game of thrones is really my number one favorite. ps. i apologize if there are a couple of grammar mistakes, that's because english in not my first language. wish you all the best :)"

2020-01-01,ketkigyllingberg,My unpopular opinion,10,this show is overrated.the episodes is way to long and it gets pretty boring watching got.there's also to many characters.
2019-05-20,anshul-lacoul,Right ending but........,10,lots of criticism and hate understandably..i felt disconnected don't know why. it was the right ending but presented in a wrong way
2019-05-20,muntazirmehdi678-197-612561,Farewell,10,"i think i enjoyed a lot throughout 9 to 10 years we respect that efforts they have made for entertained us, i think this is not the end like ""game of thrones"" this is like a third class drama that ends like this."
2018-08-20,shalujustin,A Game of Thrones,10,"game of thrones is the second best tv show in history after breaking bad. with a lot of characters they seem to manage it perfectly. talking about characters, anyone can be killed at anytime so your constantly on the edge."
2019-06-05,vishalkumarnss,Last season cost it to be best.,10,it's a amazing show to watch till 7 season. last season cost the series to be the greatest.
2019-05-18,atul-07119,Worst Downfall Ever,10,"seriously what the hell were the writers thinking, this is not the got we loved, please give us a kind of conclusion with a kind of feel that made us hooked to the show in the earlier seasons, why could you not make more seasons and given us a fitting plot to follow, just why, why and why is the question, after seeing this season's downfall am wondering why did i waste my precious hours watching this show, it looks like a slap to our face, please do not ever make shows again if you plan to fool your fans by spoiling the last season so badly. can you please explain to me why danny went mad after the bells were rang as i clearly don't understand the motive as what does she intend to rule after completely destroying the place where the iron throne was, seriously explain me why a liberator of slaves would unexpectedly go insane and kill innocents, where was the prophecy of cersei dying at a younger brother's hand, like what the hell were you thinking irrespective of how big a fan base you hair i can assure you, you have lost everyone's trust, remember fans are what make your field successful, so don't disappoint them.well this is not even worth 1 star, i don't even care about the stellar direction as it had an amazing view, but everything else made it a trash episode as my favourite parts were the dialogue's, suspense which were drained from the 3 rd episode onwards, what a bad show this turned out to be, seriously such a bad slap to the face which will leave a very bad mark. i had 3 posters stuck to my wall for this show, i removed them tore them and threw them where they belong, the dump along with this season. too disappointed.will no more recommend this show to anyone who are yet to watch, instead will tell them save your precious time on this"
2019-05-12,shreyasvenkat,What started out great is now nothing more than meh.,2,"potential spoilersi remember the very first time i started watching game of thrones. it was different , unexpected plot twists everywhere but it all made sense . the deaths of characters were not a ""shock device"" to be exploited but a plot device to drive the story further into a better ,much unexpected direction.after the show ran out of source material ie. george rr martin's books the show took a massive hit. the episodes reduced in quality. characters kept dying off for no reason whatsoever except shock value which to be fair got me maybe once then it became boring. the deaths don't mean anything and the story has gone up in flames due to what i can only assume to be a lack of imagination or lazy writing.the last season which is currently airing kills everything you hold dear (not talking about the characters) , the plot. a villain who was built up from the very first episode of the first season just killed off as a mere foot soldier by someone who we didn't see coming . that's all the show has become a show where anything can happen unless you're a main character. where people die because it's shocking not because it's good for the plot.also the show cuts off on story elements to showcase it's cgi. people just travel from place to place like there's a subway in the realm. all while showing it's incredible cgi battles , dragons and wolves which by the way don't really matter as they're just there to look pretty.the show now just kills anyone without any explanation as to why or how. imagine this , you're flying on a dragon and a guy in a ship shoots 3 perfectly aimed shots on a flying dragon all while behind a rock structure where he cannot be seen yet he can see you. it's a ship not a pebble you can hide behind an island.i feel like the pitch for the last 3 seasons went something like this- ""hey i know what'd be good. let's kill some people not major characters thought and even if they do we'll resurrect them then have a couple of battles and viola we have a perfect show with no plot whatsoever""."
2015-06-20,madcaphawk,After Watching 5 seasons,1,"at first i gave this series 10 out of 10 and was happy with it. show started strong and the at the end of 1st season i was really angry when they killed ned like they did!! but it was ok i mean i was waiting to see some pay back as they(wolf and company) were no sheep, wolf will hit back somehow. following season was some more disappointment in terms of my aspirations lol(robb dead and others in following season ,oberyn, stannis etc). well still there were some sparks that made me feel that there is still some hope and things will change but no!!! there are so many reasons people liked the show at first but then the way it is going i really don't want to watch that. bran and arya stark is left who are very young and sansa i hate that girl lol, i wish they killed her instead!! tyrion is a very good and interesting character who is left other than starks. but rest all i was rooting for are dead. not that its anybody's fault or am blaming them for anything but i don't want to watch a tv show and get angry every time at the end of every season and wait to get furthermore disappointment. only few things to enjoy and many things to annoy is the crux of this series!!! i don't care about that dragon born girl dany, or other lannisters, or tyrells and other such kind of houses. devious and cheaters do win but not all the time! so something is wrong here. it has tuned into those kind of shows which are so sad all the time and joyful rarely. i am not a hater but they took my joy away and i really don't like game of thrones now. am not here to watch cersie and tyrells playing house, or bolton bastard doing tortures and stuff. dumb night watcher killing jon snow. its so sad every time this series progresses. some people might like that kind of stuff but i will rather play counter strike or football or listen music. anyway i posted this so if anyone just don't wanna see good guys die all the time over and over they can read this and stay away lol :p"
2020-03-07,richard_b_b,"Awesome show, terrible final season",5,"loved every season, but the last one was rushed and completely off the pace and style of the others and ruined it, we burned our books lol, hence 7, otherwise would give it a 10."
2021-10-09,anasneeloth,Feel bad beat series,10,a must watch before you diecontents are out of the world and story is complex awsome.characters nailed their part fantasy at its best.
2019-08-16,taruntaneja-20356,Worst Finale.. Remake required,10,"a very very good series. the best of all that have aired so far. it should have been ended in a way the series has always been. i am very disappointed with the end i have just seen.
i actually waited for game of thrones to end so that i could watch it from the starting till end.
no one expected a happy ending of this series but a mad queen and john banishment was never expected.
anyone who would watch will enjoy every moment of this series but will be disappointed at the end.
a very strong plot, a good starting.
till season 7 it is awesome but after that...
i dont know why they have even created it, they could have waited for another year if they didnt have a strong end.
overall, worth watching it except the ending."

2019-05-17,jmmol,Best TV show with the worst ending unfortunately.,1,"got has changed the tv shows drama industry forever, you hate characters then you love them, and the other way around, they turn your smile into a sad face in seconds by the shocking events that happens through the seasons but they missed it all up with the script in last season it was very sad for me to say goodbye to a show like this with an ending like the one we had."
2019-12-05,bretzarpi,How to ruin a TV show 101,10,just updated my rating after realizing that it was still at 10... the first six seasons were great the show was actually one of my favorites at the time when they came out. then came the 7th which was disappointing but i still found a way somehow to get hyped for the last season. i spent hours reading theories... then reality hit me and it hit me hard. i'm not even going to analyze just how bad the last season was. i had to read two books just to forget how bad the show turned out to be and remember the good things this story had to offer.
2018-10-02,tdollar,Better the second time,10,"i didn't start watching until season 6 was over. i needed something new to occupy my spare time. i stand by my initial impression; first two episodes of the season are good, middle season is usually pretty slow, second to last episode is the best, and season finale gets you excited for the next season. but then it repeats. every mid,season felt like a chore to watch. recently i started rewatching it with my fiancé who had never seen the show and i'm enjoying it much more now! the season still plays out the same way with me but now i don't have the struggle of remembering who the characters are and learning what's going on. it's a good show with great acting and really awesome effects. it just didn't completely steal my heart like it did with most other people. 8/10 stars because it is a good show. a little boring at times but maybe that's just me. not everyone has to love every show."
2015-08-08,makeamericagreatagain1,Laugh Out Loud Levels of Terrible,10,"i don't get it: how could sean bean's character be in the first season of this supposedly new and popping',fresh series if his character took a metric butt ton of arrows to the chest in one of those unbelievably terrible movies that came out over a decade ago? it doesn't matter, really. this series is abhorrent and vapid, to which the box office returns and unfavorable reviews of the prequels can attest. it's been going on for almost 15 years and now they make a television show and come out with more books? it's time to move on.by the way, did you know that tolkien made up his own language for one of the races in the book? real winner there, ladies."
2019-05-27,stieriks,Best show,9,seasons 1 to 8 rated together are 10/10. seasons 7 and 8 are beautifully made but they rushed unfortunately. an amazing show none the less.
2019-05-21,doidamaluca,THAT ENDING THO,7,"how to ruin a great show in just one season i loved this show never read the books but it's really good tv
there were some notable changes through the seasons like i think we can actually watch the writing change when they stoped adapting the book material
some things are good others not so much but all in all still very entertaining
that all changes with this laughable final season i would even go as far as say dont watch it but then you would be left with a enormous clifhanger ending
but i did feel like all my time was wasted
basically if i knew what i know now i think i wouldnt have ever started watching it
yet i can still recomend it based on everything else plot twists, acting, visuals, blood and gore etc so 5/10 final score i guess"
2015-08-19,votina,Great until the 5th season,10,"i'll keep it short.it's an amazing show that really sucks you in and makes you talk about it with your friends for days.you have the feeling that everything in the show actually happened,making you bond to the characters even more.and unlike many shows this one doesn't go far from the book.that's all until the 5th season.after that you don't know what's happening.the show runners d&d keep ruining your favorite book characters and writing stories that don't happen in the books all for the sake of the ""shock factor"".the whole season 5 is based on ""wow,look at this,this is so shocking"".in the last episode in literally every scene there's a death and most of them don't happen in the books.i strongly recommend watching it up until the 5th season and then start reading the books.oh,and the only good scenes in season 5 are ""the walk of shame"",""hardhome"" and the last scene in season 5.they are brilliantly acted out and follow the books by letter."
2019-05-21,pegahghaemian,The ending,10,i like the ending of the show. it was reasonable and absolutely not disappointing. honestly after seven years my watch has ended and i still love this series. i can't understand the criticism either.
2016-07-17,louismales,potentially good show completely destroyed by over-rating and poor storytelling,6,"well what a waste of my time. i've watched 3 episodes of the walking dead and each episode of them is better than anything i've watched here. game of thrones is fairly well acted (despite some series regulars copping out in certain scenes) but from the amount of praise the acting got, i was a bit confused because it has to be some of the worst i have ever seen, and jesus some of the child actors (if you can call them that) were just annoying because they couldn't act, not just because they were written poorly.and my main problem with the show is that it is just so confusing. and yeah, maybe i should have paid more attention, but the times i wasn't paying attention was when i was having to research things that i was confused about!! and anyway, it should be the shows problem to engage me, the viewer, i shouldn't have to feel engaged myself. another issue with this show is the ensemble cast that every praises, for unknown reasons. i mean seriously, i just watched the season 6 finale when the sept of baelor was destroyed, and then i saw my mom watching scenes from season 1 and there were characters who i didn't even realise had been in it since the start! and how can you praise a show with its ensemble cast when it decides to just completely write out characters for a season (bran, osha, rickon (what was the point of him) hodor (same issue with rickon)). i just found it almost too difficult to be invested in the characters because only the lannisters, daenerys (awful actress) and occasionally a stark are the only ones to get plenty of screen time. and the only characters i like on this show are cersei and jaime and sometimes arya. am i supposed to like tyrion just because the actor who plays him is a dwarf? does being a dwarf instantly make him a badass? the only thing i saw resembling badass in tyrion was when he shot tywin, but even then killing your incest dad doesn't make you badass. one of the reasons i believe this show to be overrated is because it has a death near enough every episode. characters dying does not equal good storytelling. e.g the red wedding, the episode was awfully/averagely written, with 2 main character deaths, but this some how received 9.9. twd first episode only received a 9.2? wtf???however, with all its flaws, the show does have its benefits that kept me watching all the way till the current episode (i don't quit watching a tv show even if i don't like it, its an hour long, i'm sure i have 1 hour a week to watch something with potential). the best part of the show is without a doubt cgi. especially the battle sequences in watchers on the wall and hardhome."
2015-09-26,abigailjade-10952,"I'm sorry, I just don't get it...",10,"i'm probably in a minority in my views of the game of thrones, but i have to say that it really wasn't for me. i know a lot of people who love this programme and rate it as one of the best television shows that they have ever watched. for this reason, i have attempted to watch it several times and each time have found myself disinterested.i would, however, say that the acting is superb and convincing but the characters were just too unlikeable. this, for me, is a major fault in any tv series. nothing about them grabbed me and for this reason, it was doomed from the start. i also found the incestuous scenes uncomfortable, it felt like it was intended to titillate as well as be a part of the story, which is why i felt so much discomfort. the scene with daenerys being one of them (first episode) i think that the various mise,en-scene of the game of thrones is amazing and i think that the filming locations that were chosen were on point. the visuals of this television show could have sold it to me if what was happening was actually interesting."
2016-02-16,hannerelle,Not For The Faint Of Heart,9,"when i first heard about got, i had no idea what i was getting myself into. i hadn't previously read the books, so i knew nothing. (lol) with that said, got blends fantasy, action, sexuality, and a little comedy here and there. as the seasons progress, the series leans mostly toward the darker side. but never,the-less, the series is definitely one to check out! think lord of the rings but on a much larger much more in-depth scale.i will say that the violence and sexuality should be noted. got holds nothing back, and you will be submersed in a world of no shame or modesty.that aside, the first season focuses mainly on one family, but eventually more characters come, and the story begins to follow several different stories in several different places all at once by bouncing back and forth, just like the book.the story can sometimes be difficult to keep up with, with the amount of story change, and 'back and forth'-ness. this would be the only real downside. the situations each character is faced with, the action, costume and set designs, the acting, and of course the landscape all make up for that! you will be at the edge of your seat through 98% of the series, and when the season is over you will go through got withdraws as you beg for more!"
2019-06-23,jimhaney-42345,One of my favorite TV series ever.,10,"no spoilers in this review. this series was a great adaptation of the books. yes, they went off script in the later seasons, and yes the last episode was not exactly what i and many had hopped for... but it is still by far one of the best tv series of our generation. truly awesome story telling and production value. the only tv series i think would rank higher is breaking bad. got is awesome entertainment, and everyone tied to making it should be proud."
2019-05-06,adamheritage-15333,"Can we please just restart season 8, perhaps 7 as well, but mainly 8",7,"first off, i used to have a 10/10 for the show but after watching season 8 ep 3, i can no longer consider it a masterpiece. the writing has been atrocious, no spacing between major moments. season 8 is definitely going to be the worst season in got history, even if the last two eps are brilliant which i'm starting to feel is highly unlikely. however i'm still giving got as a whole 8/10 because of what the show once was, but season 8 has ruined it. their best hope now is to hire some new writers and redo season eight with 10 episodes, so key moments are spaced out and not feel all jumbled together like they do currently, and give more justice to the night king so that got can go out with a bang and be remembered as the greatest show that ever was, like it was supposed to."
2021-09-27,timdv91,Slow and predictable,1,"a predictable and slow progressing drama series, stretched out ridiculously long in order to make it a financial milk cow.for real, the average government agency works faster than this serie progresses."
2019-05-14,poojarockshere,Writers literally destroyed the characters !,1,"worst direction so far. suddenly the breaker of chains becomes mad queen? what direction was the writer even intending to go? jaime also destroyed his character again? tyrion betrays danny because of sansa?? is sansa becoming just like littlefinger and wants to rule? what the hell is this story even implying? jon snow suddenly deserves the throne? and why? turning out to be a complete waste of time for watching season 1,7.. hate hate hate"
2019-05-02,stijnwelten,Great series that became dreadful after a while,10,"this show used to be in my top 3 favourites of tv shows, and i watch a lot of tv shows! after season 7 i watched the quality slowly decline. season 8 episode 3 ruined the whole thing for me. i honestly lost all interest in the rest of the show, and this makes me sad, really.."
2019-05-25,stijnwelten,No consistency,10,"the show starts of great, but doesn't know how to handle all of it's storylines, which makes the end highly disappointing."
2019-11-06,ericaanderson-79911,What a letdown!,10,the first 6 seasons were amazing! even with the characters that were killed off.season 7...mehseason 8 was one of the biggest disappointments in tv history! not only was it a betrayal to the viewers but it was a betrayal to the characters that were so intricately developed over the previous seasons. for shame!
2021-03-10,lukejohnson-22854,A First!,1,"this is the first review that i've ever written. this is the greatest show of all time. it is by far. from the first episode to the last, it holds you captive. i am watching the second episode of season two as i type this, and i'm watching it for the third or fourth time. if you enjoy watching tv or movies, you will enjoy this. it's a story of family, honor, dishonor, truth, lies, war, but never peace. i envy you if you've never watched it."
2019-04-29,eaiossa,Gotta love the haters :),9,"jesus christ, the whole comment section is just hate. i rewatched this episode twice just looking at the foundation of the episode and what brought it to light.arya is an assassin who can be very stealthy, i feel it was a bit weird with her jumping out of nowhere but come on, it was breathtaking and astonishing to witness.the lighting was perfect imo, it showed the raw footage of al out war against death. it brought a storm with it and was defeated when hope all seemed lost.the criticism with all the main characters being ""made safe and armoured"" is pure bullshit. we lose 4 great characters that made a difference in the show.everyone is forgetting that they literally only have 6 episodes to finish this, killing the night king in episode 3 made a good entrance to the next phase which is the end to cersei's rein.i hope everyone will actually be willing to watch the rest that this perfect show has to offer. will be looking forward to the next episodes to come."
2019-04-29,mattclayb,IMDB needs a new rating just for GoT,5,"game of thrones blows my mind.how such a complex array of enthralling characters and epic story came out of one persons mind i'll never know, rr martin is not of this world.i have just had to spend 30 minutes down rating every other review i've made on imdb because quite simply nothing can share the same rating as game of thrones.the only bad thing i can say about it got is that it wrecks all other tv / movies forever, there is nothing like it.the tv production is beautifully put together, exceptional casting, soul shakingly epic and eye poppingly brilliant."
2018-05-24,fishermark,The best tv show ever made,5,"got to say it, reading some of the reviews with people giving thrones 1/10 is a joke, maybe it's not for everyone but giving it a one out of 1/10 slow minded fools, 10/10 absolutely the best tv show on earth"
2019-05-20,maxpal,1/10 bcoz of season 8 disappointment,7,simply disappointed by last season...sad...lame writing...
2019-05-03,martin_the_man,Dont listen to the people giving 1 star,10,"although episode 3 of season 8 have some faults it still is one of the best things ever seen on screen, these rating of 1 star just tell how biased alot of people are after fantasizing about millions of different theories. game of thrones is by far the best produced show, its writing, cinematics and music is just so good that it will change you as a person. this is a show for which film creators will look back at and build upon and say ""as we stand on the shoulders of giants"". game of thrones is an absolute masterpiece, and every episode is almost close to perfection. people giving this show 1 star or even below 10 has to be out of their mind, even though there are good movies and shows out there, it is absolutely nothing that even come close to rival game of thrones(except breaking bad) in terms of music, cinematics, writing and acting. i think the 1 stars will be a psychology case in the future of how people making up theories and wanting them to be true can ruin their experience."
2019-10-12,griselykke,As a whole,7,"this show does no longer deserve the 9+/10 rating that it has. in my opinion a series should be judged as a whole, just like a movie. if shawshank redemption's last 30 minutes sucked it would not have the rating that it has. still this series did great things, sadly the last couple of seasons ruined the masterpiece it should've been and deserved to be."
2016-04-18,martinm-04340,Absolutely amazing,10,"with an average score of almost 10/10 from almost 1 million users, do i even need to write a review? oh well, why not?no tv series or movies can be compared to got. in many bs movies/shows you can predict the ending after watching it for a few minutes (good ones always win and the bad ones seem to be completely retarded, blind, and incompetent. well, not anymore!!!the story in got is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events.acting is great, costumes and scenery as well. every character is unique and interesting, and its great watching them develop. everything is top quality. if you start watching this, be prepared to get addicted quickly , you'll just feel a strong urge to watch the next episode, and another, and another until no more episodes are left. there is a downside to got however that needs to be mentioned: as many have stated, after watching it, you will realize that 99% shows/movies out there are not up to its standards. a show of this quality is rare indeed."

2019-05-20,walid_elfahim,Really u call this an ENDING!?,10,and breaking bad will stays on the throne as the greatest ending of all times
2019-04-21,christenkeanu,The best TV show I have ever seen,8,"if someone doesn't watch this tv show, he will go to hell. it's just amazing!! the acteurs are just great!! the best show i have ever watched!! the story is just incredibly weird and strange and also complex, but this is so what makes game of thrones better than any other series"
2016-04-30,joeyalgord,I think GoT has run out of steam :( oh well,8,"started out very well. 1st season was gripping, witty, entertaining. season 2 and 3 were also quite good. i was very keen on watching every episode as soon as possible.but from season 3 to season 5 negatives of the show have increased as positives became tiresome or non existent.many boring episodes consisting of pointlessly long torture scenes mixed with action scenes and repetitiveness.the show has become convoluted and tries to fit in too much. subplots don't work well. character development suffers in place of shock scenes. i don't particularly care for any of the characters anymore. which is all disappointing.season 5 i did not enjoy much past the first few episodes (they were good though).if i wanted cliffhangers and a budgeted formula, i'd watch the cw or some superhero crap; it isn't far off right now. i feel like hbo and the producers have settled on their success and aren't going to be putting in the quality they had originally. sucks for the people jumping on board now and putting in their best.the show was right up there with breaking bad, maybe not as good. but definitely a winner worthy of 7.5+ stars, but now? i guess i'll watch it? a resounding ""meh"" for the show in its current state."
2019-05-20,nayan-23813,WORST ENDING,10,one of the worst ending of the great show.. they should make the 8th season again its completely disappointing
2017-02-09,thecoolestcat,One of the best television shows out there. Period.,7,"if you are looking to watch a quality t.v. show with good acting, great screenplay, and amazing scenes with detailed character, well, you have come to the right place.this show has you follow multiple people per episode so it isn't set to just one person or place. you follow very well thought out characters across a world with two continents and many different kingdoms, hence ""game of thrones"". many different characters come and go so you will always being on the edge of your seat seeing who lives or dies. some of the episodes end abruptly which leaves a cliffhanger for the next episode which makes you want to watch even more.next to the interesting plots and characters, there is a vast amount of blood, murder, sex, nudity, and witchcraft to keep you entertained. although this is not the entire show, these all make a broad statement when watching.there are very little, if any, television shows that amount to the level of ""game of thrones"". 10/10 would recommend to anyone."
2019-06-30,mynameisjayne,Awful Ending,1,"i loved game of thrones, i started reading the books and i re,watched all the episodes before the final season, but i shouldn't of bothered. for some reason i thought the tale would have a deep historical plot which would unravel at the end of the season. i thought that bran and the night king had historical background, although it's clear that george martin is well educated and has used many historical references, the characters were pointless. what was the point of the night king and the dragons? they served no real purpose.
the long night was claimed to have lasted 100 years, but the night king was killed by arya within one episode (which seems to have lasted one night).
the directors seem to have been far more interested in creating something that would 'shock' the audience rather than closing the show with the ending it deserved.
got is great for bubbleheads who just want something simple to watch.
a low score given due to the disappointment caused by the execution."
2019-05-20,saeed-99631,Finall season,10,the end of a very beautiful season except for the role of john snow was very marginalized and unfair to his right and the injury of pran to the throne is unfair but generally very beautiful end.

2016-06-16,srksonpasa,Great work based on the best book,10,"i had very high expectations from this series and i believed that it will (like most tv series) absolutely ruin the book. and i couldn't have been more wrong! where do i start...the cast is great, though not amazing with one exception , sean bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the north, eddard stark. the setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogues are just as they should be. now to get to the part most people are interested in: what is this? what can i expect of the series?this is a great tv presentation of martins epic books. however if you have read the book than you can be disappointed if some characters are not nearly as what you have imagined them by reading. there are two main problems - red viper martel of dorne and sir loris tyrell who are the best heroes of their fractions manly characters who we gay in tv which is disgusting."

2020-08-28,jensskoufurbo,Dont watch season 8.,7,"i rated the show 10/10 long ago, then i went back after watching season 8 and changed it to 1/10, the shows first 6 seasons are good, season 7 is okay, and season 8 is the worst garbage i have seen and ruined the entire show for me."
2018-11-01,stephpeever,Masterpiece,5,"i do not understand how this series hasn't won more golden globes. it's beautifully written. portraying the worst and best pieces of human behings. i've re watched the series and it's surprising how much more you pick up on. cleverly, amazingly written!"
2019-05-22,oscarhutchins,Decade-defining.,10,"game of thrones has been described as a decade,defining series and is undoubtedly one of the most popular television shows ever to grace our screens.it is filled with the brim with deep, intriguing storylines, supported with iconic characters and breathtaking settings.moreover, it is often credited with having the highest quality music, casting, costume design and acting.however, unfortunately the quality of the writing during the later seasons (7&8) fell drastically - with many fans even petitioning to re-write the seemingly 'rushed' season 8.nonetheless, game of thrones is still regarded as an amazing show, that many would still recommend to friends and family.below i have ranked (out of 10) the factors which i believe are crucial to the success of any show:music - 10/10 casting - 10/10
costume design - 10/10
character design - 10/10
acting - 9/10
choreography- 9/10
writing - 8/10
pacing - 8/10in the case of writing and pacing, they both would have been 10/10, in my opinion, if it were not for the unavoidable flaws of the final two seasons."

2018-02-23,aliayadali,The best TV show ever,10,i think this series the best series in the world and i love it so much for me season 6 the best season and episode 9 the best episode
2019-04-29,majaguara,Why the world loves it so much...,10,"long conversations in dark rooms. sometimes a fight. cartoons,like fantasy, with no colors or happy endings. and so 8 seasons go."
2018-08-24,adrikajyoti-40767,Excellent,9,must watch. fantasy never seemed so real. with the very first episode it will get you hooked
2016-08-22,ethanemmert,A fantastic show filled with constant twists and unexpected turns. Game of Thrones is the perfect show.,1,"game of thrones is based on a series of novels written by the very talented george r. r. martin. the show contains everything a truly amazing show should. the acting is phenomenal and the accompanying cinematography, story, sets, visual effects, and writing simply can't be found anywhere else. got tells human stories in a fantastic world running rampant with magic and otherworldly things that provide thrills and really hook a watcher in. the show is well done and one that shouldn't be passed up. all the characters (even the villains) are nearly impossible not to get extremely attached to. if you think important characters in other movies or television shows have met gruesome deaths your whole view will change after seeing game of thrones. truly no character is safe. in conclusion the show is the best show that there ever has been or will be. a man will always love game of thrones. the acting is amazing and the story is gripping beyond belief. give game of thrones a watch!"

2019-05-21,oliverlind,This show was my life,5,"i was a spokesperson for this show and i could talk about it for hours. then season 7 arrived and for the first time i started questioning the logic that the show always had followed. i choose to not see these things and whenever someone said something i defended the show. then season 8 came... im sad to say that season 8 is pure garbage. they mix up plots, make up prophecys, destroy characters and dont give any answers to the things you have been waiting for. now i tell people that its not worth seeing. the dissapointment is not worth it. with time i will probably put my rating even lower.season 1,6 pure magic season 7 still holding up
season 8 ..."
2019-10-09,oliverlind,Come on folks,10,"how does this serie still have 9,4? it does not deserve to be close to 7 after the horrible ending... this is not a legendary serie we are going to talk about in the future anymore..."

2016-07-02,hoopsmessiah,Best show on TV EVER!,10,"i had to come and write a review even though i rarely do, so why am i writing one now? because of the trolls that just love to hate on anything and try to drag down the score of what is easily a 10 star rated show. there is no reason this show should be scored anything below a 10. it has everything and is so appealing visually the only score for it is a 10, acting 10, story line 10, special effects 10 and so on. the only complaint i have is george wanted 13 episode seasons and d&d would only do 10, that is truly sad, d&d have shorted us important story lines that have been cut for time and so they have cheated us out of 18 eps at and hour each, that's 180 hours of got left on the table, that's a travesty.so for you trolls that want to hate something so glorious, hate away, you are insignificant and enjoy your miserable existences while i and millions of others enjoy the game of thrones :)"

2021-04-29,klaasdannysen,Dracarys to all critics!,10,"why is season 8 disappointing? what's wrong with the denouement? what other outcome did you expect? did you pay attention at all???based on the acting, directing, camera work, costumes and not to forget the cgi, this is simply the best series ever! but you have to get it! 'cause all men must die, and all men must serve."

2019-05-24,thexgamer-93310,Astounding,9,"honestly speaking, the show shouldnt be based off of the last season alone but should take into acount the last 7 before it which all in all brings us to the conclusion that game of thrones is one of, if not, the greatest series of all time. on the complaints about dany going mad and how it didnt fit into the character, i find that it makes perfect sense for her to go mad and even though it might not be what everyone wanted to happen if you truely understood the histpry of hpuse targaryen then you would truely understand that it isnt a ""rushed"" or ""dumb"" decisicion to make dany go insane since its perfectly aligned with the history of her family, all their insest and the fact that she was betrayed by most her allies, had her relationship rejected by her lover, and had the people rally behind her rivals to take the iron throne. i find that the decision for dany to go mad and for her death at the hands of jon makes total sense, and even though i hate to see my favourite character on the series go, i dont find it out of the ordinary. heres to the greatest show ever."

i would advise against investing too much in the show. it doesn't deliver.
and to those writers consoling themselves by saying that there was no way they could please everyone, go see avengers endgame, that's how you finish a series, not with a soppy saggy bit of microwaved lettuce."

2019-06-14,gary_best,Like a good relationship gone very bad.,9,"it starts off beautiful, exciting, nerve wracking even. your learning about the character, the depth, the complexity. your heart flutters every time you see her (the show) and you long for more. season 1,6then cracks start to show, somethings changed, somethings going wrong. you question is this the person i thought you knew? their different, less genuine, rushing you when you want time, less patient and caring, like you are bothering them. then you realised everything you thought you loved has decayed and been replaced by something that looks and feels like her (the show), but deep down something is really not right. season 7before you know it things are awful. everything frustrates you. they have become so annoying and irritating, it pains you to watch it happen but you realise they just don't care. all the things you felt are eroded. you begin to hate them and yourself for enduring but see it through to a horrendous end. at that point the once great love you had is replaced by loathing.  that's game of thrones. don't bother unless your a glutton for masochistic disappointment."
2017-07-21,namanpreet-14248,all hail,10,"arguably the best tv show ever, from intense action,violence,emotion,drama,suspense it contains a lot more that anyone could have imagined. i heard about it and i started watching and man it is so addictive, you can't live without it . man i wish this could keep running for very long. acting of peter dinklage will also blow you away."

2017-08-17,cynthiacorado,A thrilling ride,6,"it's an amazing show filled with great scenery and characters alike. the plot is realistic while still being fantasy.these last seasons are rushed but they're still brilliantly done in terms of costume and action.yes the show is brutally violent but, it's fantasy plus, the medieval ages weren't elegant times anyway. even today it's pretty violent.excellent show, a must watch!"
2019-05-20,iamindrab,One of the greatest show with a unsatisfying ending!,10,"great story line, casting, acting, vfx, camera work, set , every thing is great until the last season. but only one season can't ruin the whole show. still worth watching knowing finale is not as good as the rest of the show."
2017-12-23,poghuhuedui,Falling off,6,"game of thrones was fantastic for it's first four seasons. this is most likely due to the fact that all the content was taken from the books. however as we entered season 5 the lack of talent from the writing team became apparent, the writers are very good at adapting books, not so much coming up with their own stuff.this brings us to the disappointing season 7. this season had a total of 7 episodes, a curious choice as this shortened season became the crux of some of the problems this show faced. like unrealistic travel times and underdeveloped characters.the soul of this show has been lost in the fan,service mess. things strictly happen just because it gets reactions. gone are the days of political intrigue, grey morals or careful planning. that's all been replaced by cgi plastered all over the screen, battles that make no sense, good and evil characters, entire arcs (such as littlefinger's death) that are horrendously written, ruin characters, make no logical sense just so that they can please fans that want 'cool' things to happen and care little for a well crafted story."

2017-07-19,irinawaslek,The best TV show right now,10,game of thrones is really an excellent show. i have enjoyed it for many seasons. i love emilia clarke. i hope they don't stop making the show because she wants to leave. maybe it will go on without her. the new season's first episode was excellent. i am hoping that it will continue this way. this production is so much better than the american tv shows. better acting and story telling. this is the best tv show right now.
2017-07-27,temporary-97613,Dropped the ball,10,"first few seasons were tremendous, recently d&d have dropped the ball and let it roll around in a pile of sh*t. each new episode is consistently disappointing. this could have been something great, now it's just something popular.there's not much more i can say, we'll all watch it anyway, just don't expect it to be good."

2012-05-23,edthayer,On finding Game of Thrones on VHS,10,"having heard much and more of the popular hbo series game of thrones, i decided it was time to journey to blockbuster and acquire mine own vhs copy of the show. so i loaded up my vhs rack, five of my favorite dogs, and a costco,sized box of reese's peanut butter cups into my trusty honda accord.the only blockbuster still in business is way in the south part of town, so i was in for a long quest. if it wasn't for the sugary sustenance provided by the reese's cups, the companionship provided by my dogs, and the listening pleasure of ""the lord of the rings"" (unabridged) on cassette tape, i could have very easily gone mad.although many long years had passed, blockbuster was just the way i remembered it. the same off-white plaster, squarish building, with blocky blockbuster lettering on the front, and the promise of a plethora of vhs tapes within.""i come seeking the game of thrones,"" i told the young man at the counter. ""on vhs. please bring it to me forthwith.""the young man, who's naming plate said scott, was a dubious knave, clearly of lowbirth. he squinted his vacant eyeballs and knitted his bushy, bear-like eyebrows and said, ""i'm sorry, but we don't carry that on vhs.""""do not play such games with me, boy,"" i warned him. ""i see your game of thrones display right before my own eyes.""""yeah... those are dvds. i can rent you a dvd?""""a dvd? do you take me for a fool, boy?""""hi, i'm adam, the manager,"" said a trollish-looking imp-man. he had long snaggly yellow- brown teeth, and two large, watery eyeballs that seemed way too large for his head. ""is there a problem here sir?""""this guy wants to rent some vhs tapes,"" said scott, the idiot.""okay. i understand. i am very sorry sir, but we no longer carry vhs tapes at this location,"" said the imp.what game were they playing here? a video store without videos. a riddle worthy of my late tutor, brometheus.clearly they were both liars. for some reason they didn't want to rent me the game of thrones, but why? what secrets were they trying to conceal?but i was tired from my long journey. and i was starting to crash from the sugar from all the peanut butter cups i had eaten. and the sound of the dogs howling from the car reminded me that i hadn't fed them or given them water in a great while. i had no choice but to leave this cursed place.""psst."" on my way out of the blockbuster, i heard a strange sound. ""psst. hey buddy. i heard you want a vhs.""there was a hairy, hunchbacked man standing half in the shadows. he was clad in stinking garments. he smelled like a rancid applecart full of old cheese and rotting apples.""i got all kinds of vhs-es,"" he whispered breathily. he opened his cloak to reveal a hidden collection of vhs tapes, more than one could count.""do you have game of thrones?"" i asked.""i have game of throats,"" he replied. ""it's basically the same thing.""""fine, i'll take it."" i gave him five dollars.after watching game of throats several times, i have come to the conclusion that the production values are poor, and the script is pretty weak for an hbo series. but despite all that, it is just as captivating as everyone says."
2018-12-30,mcdanielp-78228,The Best Show I've Ever Seen!,10,"it took me 7 seasons in for me to watch this show. i was extremely curious as to what all the fuss and hype was about and let me start by saying that it is all warranted. this show has everything you could ever ask for: exceptional performances, characters you fall in love and form a connection with, beautiful special effects, insane plot twists that leave you with your jaw lying on the floor, intense action sequences, and so much more! this show takes my breath away and i will gladly admit that i am full on obsessed with it!"

Why so bad,10,"its can be so bad , what did the writers think about the end of the series ? how can a kind and just girl change all this at once? the one who destroys the army of the dead fights for the life , after 2 episode, how could she do such a thing ?"

2019-03-11,melissakravetz,Horrible Entertainment,10,"i truly tried to give this show a chance. i watched the first season and as four time rape survivor i was completely mortified at what is being called the ""greatest show of all time."" the writers should be ashamed of themselves as they glorified the rape scenes in the book and made them more entertaining for viewers. i understand that this stuff would have taken place during medival times but the need to show it graphically and so often is completely unnecessary! so glad the show only has one season left!"
2021-01-19,rutyapatil,One of the best,8,not 10/10 because of season 8 which ruined game of thrones legacy
2019-05-20,boivinmarie-claude,Disappointed ?,3,"i have not watched the last episode yet, but i have read critics, including spoilers (bran is king ???). some people, apparently, are disappointed. the last season does not come from a book written by george rr martin, and from what i have read, it was rushed because the writers were eager to go write star wars. therefore, the last hope for those who want a different ending, is that george rr martin will (someday ... ) write books with a different ending. here are suggestions : daenerys going «mad» is not a good idea. she was women's hope in sexist man's world. also, killing all people in king's landing is dumb and useless, and it is relying on dragons way to much. humans should do more. and tyrion seems to have lost all his wit. varys dies ? damn. sansa and arya seem to have done better. i really liked the way sansa got rid of her «husband». so, a petition for hbo to refilm the last season is useless. of course, that is not going to happen. the last hope is to pray for better books !"
2020-03-30,joaommb-78218,FINALE SEASON IS TRASH,10,"well, this is my favorite show, but i give this note, because last season sucks so much... you really mess it up... why?"
2017-11-03,eidgenossattler,Big downhill after season 4,10,"season 1,4 are great and a 93/100 worth.season 5 ruined characters and locations from the book for me so i only give it a 23/100season 6 was better and had great moments but had bad plots too so i give it a 65/100season 7 was just a big fanfiction. shitty story, no logic, rushed episodes, bad acting and raped asoiaf i can only give it a 12/100this show give me 4 great seasons, 1 average-good season and 2 really bad seasons. so i am not sure what rating i should give. i just can recommend other people to watching only the seasons 1-4"
2019-05-21,vixente-84210,"Great show but, with the worst season finale ever",10,"this was the great show of all time but, it ended at the end of season 6, after it everything went down the hill and was hard to watch and season 8 was a totally waste of time, with all the nonsense that dumb and dumber did, looks like they were trying to ruin the masterpiece that george rr martin created, they both are the main villians of the show"
2019-05-21,lindadrotner-48850,I really liked The show from S.1 -S.7,10,"i liked all seasons , and could not wait for season 8. unfortunately i was disappointed, it felt like it all just had to finish to fast. the only thing i thought was fair, was that jon killed dany!! i did not think she was as fair in the end!! and i was cheering for her in s.1 to s.7"
2018-06-11,emrkeskin,Perfect,10,game of thrones is the best serie i have ever watch in my life. i think game of thrones deserves 10/10. every one must watch game of thrones.
2019-04-28,danieldevaul,Game of Thrones is overrated,8,"i'm not saying this tv show is bad at all. im through a few seasons and it is absolutely enjoyable and the plot is very good. i guess my biggest hold up is i didn't plan on signing up for soft core porn when watching the show. honestly the sex gets old and annoying after a few episodes. it's like they have a timer set and must show nudity or have sex after fifteen minutes. the story is excellent and it's well worth watching. i will rewrite my review when i finish the show. it might get better from seasons 3,8. it is a must watch for any fan of television series."

2019-12-21,sfg-68979,Thanks for the ride!,6,"okay, it's been a sufficient amount of time since the finale, so i can finally write a review without swearing.honestly, if i look at the series as a whole, it's been amazing. i'm sure i won't be the only one saying the later seasons have been very.. mixed.but it's been a true pleasure seeing the actors grow (up, in some cases) over the course of these 8 seasons. i don't think i'll ever really reconcile with the ending though, mostly because it felt so rushed. i guess i'll wait and see what mr. martin writes."
2019-05-06,iceandfire-94233,A masterpiece debased to pop culture inanity,10,"i'm giving game of thrones an 8/10 out of respect to the first four seasons. they revolutionized television, and i consider them one of the finest achievements in the history of film, and by far the finest achievement in the history of television.allow me to explain my previous experience with d&d's unique style of writing.i remember watching season 2 episode 2, outraged with the changes d&d made from the books. ""what a disgrace,"" my sweet summer child mouth swore, ""how will they ever recover from this colossal mess."" i gave that episode an 8/10. that's how good a ""bad"" episode of game of thrones was, back in its glory days.as the seasons went on, i was certainly frustrated with changes made here and there. stannis' arc was butchered. season 2 episode 9 removed perhaps the greatest moment of daenerys' character arc. robb's arc lost all of its thematic relevance. tyrion, jon, and dany were whitewashed. several key moments and characters were cut out from the show. and despite this, up until season 4 episode 10, it was the finest piece of television ever created. only breaking bad came close.then season 5 came. d&d grabbed affc and adwd, combined them into one sloppy ""epic"", cut out 85% of their material and made the rest up along as they went. characters were omitted, events horribly altered, character arcs ruined.""sons of the harpy"" was the first truly lackluster episode. 6/10. ""unbowed, unbent, unbroken"" was the first bad one. 4/10. season 6 was an improvement, yet ""blood of my blood"" and ""no one"" followed a similar trend. season 7 started. ""dragonstone"" and ""stormborn"" were both incredibly lackluster. they were followed by two masterpieces. then came ""eastwatch"" and ""beyond the wall"", which managed to be even more horrendous than ""unbowed"" and ""no one"", followed by ""the dragon and the wolf"" which is by far the weakest finale in thrones history.here's where we get to season 8. the first episode was sanguine and intellectually insulting. ""a knight of the seven kingdoms"" was actually good, which pleasantly surprised me. that jenny of oldstones scene was the greatest moment in the show for a long time, and made me almost want to excuse the horrid dialogue. ""the long night"" was absolutely horrendous. what should have been the greatest episode of got history turned into an easy candidate for the worst.at least they'll give the fight for the throne a proper depiction, right?""the last of the starks"" managed to be ""eastwatch"", ""beyond the wall"", and ""the long night"" all in one episode. i'm completely convinced that the show is not salvageable, and will end on the lowest note possible.do you want thrones to remain as the goat? good news is, if you watch the series from season 1 episode 1 to season 4 episode 10, the ending is incredibly satisfying. all the fuckups made by d&d in the earlier seasons never made anything bad, but rather just less phenomenal than it could have been. if you don't mind the story getting a little (very) messy at times, you can stop at season 6 episode 10. even if it ends on enormous cliffhangers and uncompleted character arcs, you'd be missing out on ""hardhome"", ""the dance of dragons"", ""the door"", ""battle of the bastards"", and ""the winds of winter"" if you stopped at season 4.but whatever you do, do not torture yourself upon re,watches by slogging through seasons 7 & 8. even if martin never finishes his books, never consider this the end. we can just pretend asos was the end of the story and affc and adwd were what-ifs. but whatever you do, do not equate asoiaf and got with these pieces of trash."

2019-05-25,vitorkamaral,The plot (and the series) died in a Red Wedding of bad writing,10,"i really don't know what happened after those two years that we left for d&d and the production to make a good ending and i really don't want to know. i'm not angry, just sad. i always liked the whole series adaptations around grrm universe, i felt the floppy writing in the seventh season but still liked it somehow. but well, when this season came, i simply ran out of excuses to defend what they were doing with the show.the show still worth watching until season 7. after this, it seems the writers took the whole script and put it in a kind of red wedding, with us , the audience - witnessing everything.forget about the whitewalkers mystery. why the night king and his subordinates were taking babies and turning them undead? why even the night king spare samwell? and the prophecies? and r'hllor? what happened with the night watch after all? and dorne? and essos? none of these questions are answered, instead, we all see the writers taking everything and tucking it in a blender, desperately trying to make something good from it.many people says that ""whitewalkers were not the focus"", ""winter was not the focus"". really? literally the first scene of the first season is about whitewalkers chasing rangers and this is not the focus? all the strolling around the wall and this is not the focus? 90% of the series implicitly saying ""wintah is cammin'"" and this is not the focus? if the nk plot was not the focus, then they just could have ended this in the 6th season and continued the political plot without screwing everything up in a demonstration of what looked like an irresponsible hurry. saying that important pieces of the history is not the focus is doing exactly what the writers did: pushing a big pile of garbage under a carpet made of an insultingly bad writing.i gave a painful ""4"" for the last episode. what saved it from total damnation was the astonishing cinematography, the music and the acting. the series until the last season had all of this and consistency which they killed it. after all, in the game of thrones you win or you die."

so even if it's not a 10, it's not a 1 at all.
all in all its a 9.2 star series but for me it's a 10 star series"

2011-05-08,octagon79,Mostly boring so far (3 episodes in),10,"as a fan of hbo and the fantasy genre, i thought this show would be a sure,thing, alas i was wrong. despite the universal acclaim the show is getting, i find it rather dull, boring and inconsistent. there are moments of brilliance that are too-often followed by nonsensical or badly written scenes. the imp is a great character, by far the most interesting of the bunch, so much so that he makes the rest of the characters seem like dull archetypes. the show is also very sexist and gratuitous, and i'm no prude or overt feminist, i'm also a man. the plot line with the princess being more-or-less raped over and over again who then learns how to have sex more efficiently to please the man in question, now it seems she is in love with this man and happy about having his child.... yeah i don't think that's a very convincing or morally sound character arc. between that, and scenes that occur for no natural reason other than plot advancement, i don't think its a great show. the production values are astounding, as you would expect from hbo, and the acting is great for the most part, so i' say it's slightly above average despite my complaints. i seem to be in a minority in not thinking this show is a masterpiece so i would have to recommend it for others to try for themselves."
2019-09-10,damaaah,The Greatest of All time!!,10,well what makes got is the best is u can make a good drama series or an action good series also but you can't make a show who has a great drama and great action and also great cgi and a great plot and characters everything u want you'll find it in got drama action adventure mystery fantasy even politics romantic and all of them on high level got is the goat
2020-07-01,damaaah,The Greatest of all time,10,"i understand the disappointment in the last season , but this show is absolutely amazing idk but i never watched a show have all this genres ( drama , politics , action , adventure, romance, mystery, horror ) not even mentioning the soundtracks and the great cgi or the shocking scenes .. george rr martin has created a perfect world and i'll never forget the 7 seasons and maybe season 7 wasn't that great but also it was good

2020-12-26,kingmakerh,A masterpiece,10,"it's been 10 years still we couldn't forget this masterpiece it had created such an impact in many fans amazing story. best screenplay and some always unforgettable characters like arya stark,john snow,ned stark, daenerys targaryen, tyrion lannister, cersei lannister, jaime lannister it just another unforgettable memory with such amazing characters"
2019-01-20,sherlockdetective,The King of all the shows,10,"well it's obvious that game of thrones has been the most loved show of all time. the most fascinating thing about this show is that they all makes perfect sense.
from directing to acting and vfx (mind blowing) to music all are just perfect.
i had heard the name of game of thrones but never wanted to watch it as my thoughts were that there would be some men or families fighting for a throne so that they would rule the world. that was my thought for game of thrones.
but one day my cousin asked me that have you seen game of thrones ?
i said no and i dont wanna.
and after watching it you are going to thank me for suggesting it.
i said alright if you are saying so i will give it a try.
and after i watched season 1, i was like woah!
and then my marathon begun.
within 5 days i completed season 7
and just after completing it i texted my cousin and thanked him 😁
that's the dominance of game of thrones.
it will make you fall in love with it untill you get bored with it.
just one thing more if you haven't watched it yet go for it without getting spoiled by reading or finding things about game of thrones."
2019-04-30,jamelgreaves-36478,You low raters are so dumb.,10,"yeah, spoilers straight away.arya kills the night king pretty easily, i will admit, but one. it does make more sense than jon. here's why, so in the beginning of the series we were lead to believe stannis was the one true king and the one to defeat the night king, that moved onto jon i think around the beginning of the sixth season, due to the lord of light bringing him back, before all that people thought it would be dondarrion, but you see, all these characters in one way or another, have saved arya from demise, and once they have the lord of light then let's them die, which is why i'm a firm believer jon will sacrifice himself for arya before the shows end.secondly, all it took to kill the night king, seriously ?!?!?! ""all it took"". they've been having wars for thousands of years with the night king, way way before got events were even conceptualised. they built a 700 foot high 300 mile long wall out of ice because of him in case you've forgotten, millions will have perished in the millennia they've been fighting him. i cannot stress this enough, this battle marks the end of that fight, not the beginning of it you tools.and lastly, to enforce my last point, you say all it took. 80 minutes of stunning battle screen play with amazing subversions and plot diversions, but not only that, in real time (for the characters timeline) this battle stretches across a whole night, so it's safe to say probably around 6,8 hours of fighting for them, and they lost 6 characters and tens of thousands of men. the dothraki who i believe were like 7,000 strong in the initial charge, lasted about 35 seconds ... and 55 consecutive night shoots in subfreezing temperatures if you need real struggle. when have you done 55 consecutive 10 hour night shifts ? not one single day off.show some respect at least, he's we've waited 8 years to see this and you're acting like it was the only conflict ??season 2 when sam gets trapped with army of the dead, season 5 at hardhome ? he destroyed castle black, eastwatch, last hearth and probably deep motte is it ?? and that's all the conflicts in got timeline, not ever.for me, this is undoubtedly a 10, i could understand a 9, making room for the die hard mormont fans who witnessed their favourite family wiped from existence in under 80 minutes, or the ed fans, and also small room for the darkness (i thought it really added to the suspense and really enjoyed the darkness though) but honestly. i cannot actually fathom how a got fan could rate this any lower than 9."
2018-08-19,soorajkrishnan-94291,Was good until last season,10,i don't know why they spoil the show like this by season 8...if you want to see the show end it in season 7 and thinks winter wins..thats better..don't watch season 8 it will disappoint u confirm by the poor script and character destruction

2019-05-24,baseballallstar-44096,8 years of build up to throw it all away.,9,"could get into all of the things that were ""forgotten"" and were overall just terrible but i have wasted enough time on this show. if you watch you will be seriously disappointed. i for one will go out of my way to make sure george martin or game of thrones never see another penny from me be it books, games or movies."

2019-05-21,tocratis,Winter is coming...,10,"...turned out it was a mild one!this was a great show in the first four or five seasons. once the source material dried up it was on the wane but managed to maintain my interest for two more seasons, even though they started to take liberties with the plot and pacing. but this last season has been a disaster that is going to make re,watches almost impossible.so much build up and potential squandered.such a shame. this could have gone down as one of the greatest tv shows ever, but will forever be remembered for its limp ending."
2019-09-11,farhanshaik-61582,Best tv series of all time except for the worst ending.,10,the best story line and character development but turns out meaningless at the end.
2019-05-20,emgee-25627,Dan and Dave threw it all down the drain.,10,"seasons 1 to 4 were masterpieces. no doubt they let game of thrones be deserving of its title as possibly the greatest tv series of all time. however, this was because the plot and story was not really written by the show's writers. these seasons largely followed george rr martin's masterpieces (the books). the intrigue, the unpredictability, the deep,woven politics and calculated moves made by characters, the depth of the story, and atmosphere created was immense, and all helped create what it was; amazing.the quality of the series took a dip once the showrunners over-took the book. many questionable events occured from season 5 onwards, however overall, the show was still relatively decent until season 7 started. i have intentionally left out any spoilers, hence im not going to list any of the numerous plotholes and stupid things which occured in any season after season 4.the dorne plot was atrocious, and the complete out-of-character behaviour of many protagonists (especially stannis) really made no sense.season 7 was clearly rushed, and the writing of d&d had clearly reached its lowest. or so we thought.season 8 was by far the greatest disappointment in the history of television. character arcs were completely disregarded, the main plot (the 'winter is coming' theme that had been drilled into our heads for 7 seasons) was pointless, main characters stories suddenly became irrelevant, all the history and lore of the got universe was thrown out the window and forgotten, terrible battle plans and tactics, the main characters protected by ridiculous plot armour, terrible disney-level dialogue, no depth to the story and the most ridiculous ending all add up to make this the biggest fall from grace in the history of tv & film.dan and dave (writers) could not be bothered to write a half-decent story to tie up george rr martin's life work being converted to tv, and for that they should never be allowed on another set again. grrm put his life into the books, and for the tv adaptation to be thrown down the drain is disgusting and a crime. hang your heads in shame, d&d.seasons 1-4: 10/10 seasons 5-7: 5/10
season 8: 1/10"
2018-12-28,thorsteinn-27944,Awesom adaptasion,1,"game of thrones or got is a tv adaptasion of the george r. r. martin's song of ice and fire. it maniges to bring most of it to the show ( dorne im talking about you ) and i really love it. i cant wate till april 2019 for the finale. the story of course got little weaker when the show past the books but the main things are still coming threw and some things are better like gendry becuse he is three book caracters in a one show caracter which makes for a much better ark and the tirion, daeneres relationship. i also really love the shows stark children. sansa was not married to ramsey in the books but i think that is much better and finaly now that im ending i have to say one thing. winter is coming."
2019-05-20,raedaltaamari,The last season,10,"the last season is so bad, d&d is trash in the writing, r r martin the best writer ever, he wrote
season 1,4 and it was the best seasons including season 5 and all that because the writers, season 8 is trash, but for me it's the best show ever."

2019-06-29,suryadevdev,The fantasy has gone real....,1,the game of thrones... a fantasy serial makes us belive that it had happened real. all the characters are well portrayed. one of my most favourite character is tyrion lannister which is played by peter dinklage......
2020-01-05,u_ali-96542,Best TV show ever made !!!,6,people have been too obsessed with how season 8 ended i think it was fine. season 8 is the reason the rating of the show went down but i dont think its as bad as making it to be.
2018-11-22,onurhursitoglu,perfect fiction,5,"the movie has very good actors, very good screenplay and great excitement. the series surprised me over and over again. a good bond between first and last season."
2018-12-07,natehorne-42305,Best show I've ever seen!,10,"can't wait for season 8! the night king is really mysterious which kind of bums me out cause his intentions are unknown. otherwise love the cgi for the dragons, white walkers etc. battle sequences are breath taking."

2019-05-22,alih765,Should you still watch Game of Thrones?,10,"so everyone knows that season 8 blows. it's common knowledge. for the people who haven't yet seen it, is it worth it to watch anyways?well, yes and no. i would definitely say for most you can still enjoy the majority of the show. however, if you are the type of person that values the destination more than the journey, i would be cautious.seasons 1,4: 10/10seasons 5-6: 9/10season 7: 7/10season 8: 3/10seasons 1-6 have some of my favorite moments in storytelling, ever. if you are a fan of intense, gritty realism, intriguing plot, and complex characters, i would definitely still recommend this show, just know what you're getting yourself into.my warning to those starting: do not get too emotionally attached to the show. enjoy it for its quality alone, and understand why the last 2 seasons are not as good. this way you will not be depressed for weeks on end after watching the last season like i was.let this show be the prime example of how a show goes from some of the most compelling narratives i've ever seen, to absolute trash at the end. from a purely analytical standpoint it is quite fascinating to watch."
2019-05-15,boulamanemohamed,Great Start,9,"much love, it's magnificent ""s1,s6 top""💯 season 7 not bad but season 8 is very disappointing 💔 true fan 🙏🏻"

2019-01-12,daisyrb-40456,George I miss you!,10,"season 1,4 it is a 10! season 5 still very good
season 6 well ok
season 7- the dialogue was the most ridiculous thing ever. they are killing the character tyrion, they do everything they can to keep cersei around, she is just annoying, before i would hate her because she was so good by being bad and strong. now she is just annoying and has everything she wants ( so annoying). sansa saying to jon snow: i don't need you to protect me ( seriously a woman who been trough everything she went trough would say that?? she would hug the first person she could and would want to stay close; now brienne would say that: i don't need your protection. arya- sana scene is that from soap opera?? littlefinger's death( it was so predictable and boring ), theon fight on the beach, being kicked one of the worst scenes. episode 6 travel time it was just awful."
2019-09-24,johndownhour,Cannot recommend anymore.,10,the first 6 seasons are great but the horrible rush job to finish up the show screwed it up so bad for me. so sad i loved it but can't recommend any longer i dont want anyone else to be disappointed as much as i am. nothing against the actors or the effects teams its all in the writing and directing.

2019-01-09,alistairwatson-34782,This should be a continuous drama like soap operas.,6,"this show alone sets the standard for tv shows, i have not watched anything as gripping since the wire. the complex plots, twists, and characters are all part of a massive web of storylines. fantastic! keep it coming."
2020-10-08,stujp,I think I like the end more than most people did.,3,"when i say i am a huge fan of the books, it's a big time understatement. i've studied them intensely and participated in discussions about all kinds of things. i gave it a 8 out of 10 because without the source material there was a very tall mountain to climb. the books contain much more magic, darker twists and way too many characters for a television series. they did a very satisfying job wrapping up the greatest story over told considering such.9 out of 10 particularly because not only was it a fun enjoyable show, the acting was amazing. the cinematography was amazing, the cgi was amazing, the directing was amazing. if i have one major critique it was the quality of the dialogue more than the direction of the story that made the final seasons feel different than the beginning. some characters became one,dimensional caricatures of themselves, including unfortunately tyrion, cersei, jon. euron is the show's biggest failure.but still i will always love this show for bringing these characters to the small screen."
2019-06-07,kalamper-57719,10 or 1 ???,10,10* for first 7 seasons but its 1* couse 8 season. you dissapointed everyone. sorry but you fail.

2019-03-21,nyitaliano,Winter is coming,9,"this is my first ever review of any movie or show. i been coming to imdb for about 4 years and never thought to make a comment about any movie or show,but now one of the greatest shows of all time is ending. game of thrones is in its final season,with simply 6 episodes remaining in movie length to fulfill the ""throne"". besides ""the sopranos "" this is by far in my opinion the greatest show ever done by hbo...the fantasy of such a prolific drama and suspense is ending, ""winter is coming "" and if you have not watched a single episode,i strongly urge you too binge on the seven seasons prior,you will not be disappointed. george r.r. martins epic story is beautifully brought to light by david nutter and david benoiff in a direction of excellence. in my opinion ""game of thrones "" is in one word ""perfection """
2019-03-21,nyitaliano,Winter has come,10,"i have been coming to imdb for 4 years and just never thought to write a review about any show or movie. i thought to myself since game of thrones is in its final season,i had to write something. not since ""the sopranos "" have i ever seen such perfection in television,hbo and david benioff and david nuttier take george r.r. martins epic fantasy of drama and suspense and deliver perfection in ""game of thrones""....i strongly urge you if you have been living in a cave or just have not had the privilege of watching game of thrones..i strongly strongly believe you should find the time in binging the seven seasons of excellence that lead up to the final six episodes of game of thrones...in one word i give this show is utter ""genius"". no show in my mind besides ""the sopranos"" could live up to hands down the greatest show ever!!! game of thrones!!! to all the other throne family,we shall endure the final six episodes starting april 14th,as i watch the trailer,i become immersed in the elequantly adaption of perfection...i know i keep saying it but it truly is! enjoy everyone,as ""game of thrones"" is finally upon us it comes as bittersweet knowing it will end...but like ""cersei"" says ""when you play the game of thrones there is no middle ground you win or you die. epic!! ,perfection!!"
2019-03-19,mervin16,Literally the Best TV Show of all time!,1,"i've watched many tv shows in my life, but this one is one of the most awesome tv show i've ever watched. for some of you, you'll find it boring in the beginning but stick with it, you won't regret it. #forthethrone"
2019-05-27,kkgonzaga,I wanted to leave a serious complaint!,3,"many are coming in to give notes to the series and the episodes just for sabotage! they want so much to force the producers to change to the end that they want, that just enter leave a bad note to harm the series!
sabotage!! i do not know how to denounce it, but fan clubs i actually read that they would try to sabotage the series anyway beginning by the note of that channel. they could gauge this kind of thing more carefully, because only your math is not fighting any sabotage or people intent on damaging the series .."
2019-06-09,seanproductions,One of the best shows ever made.,9,"where do i even begin? first off the writing. the show does a brilliant job translating the books to the small screen, and besides some notable changes, like the character difference of renly baratheon and the missing character of lady stoneheart, the shows remains faithful to the books in the first four or so seasons. while most of the show is built with dioulouge, i was still interested in the conversations, as they often revealed main plot points, characterization, or were just plain interesting. season 5 does have a little too much dialogue, and it can get boring at times. yeah, got has a obscene amount of deaths, but most of them make sense and aren't there for pure shock value, though there are a view that are used for shock value, like osha's death. in red wedding, it makes sense for everyone to be murdered because walter frey has a legitimate reason to kill everyone. also, when john snow dies, that makes sense because who wouldn't be mad at jon for siding with the enemies? the characters are all written in depth, and you feel attachment towards them. because of the more realistic tone, we can associate with the character's thoughts and feelings, as they closely associate to our thoughts and feelings. what i'm saying is that most of the character's are written very well and make the show as good as it is. the political drama is awesome and is shockingly relevant to the plots and schemes that are going in politics today. in my opinion, got shows how ruthless politicians can be in their quest for power, and also shows relevance in other issues such as prejudice, tolitarism, and invasion of privacy that are found in world politics today. the acting is spot on, and notable performances include peter dinklage, emilia clarke, lena heady, and kit harrington. also, the set pieces really make the show, and despite some slip ups in the final season, they all fell totally real and you felt immersed into the fantasy world. the directing is absolutely astonishing for every episode, and all the battles and fights feel epic and intense. the cinematography is also amazing, and really captures the mood of the scenes. overall, got is very well written, features great characters, shocking doses of realism and real life politics, heartbreaking deaths, great acting, and great directing. one last thing. i know the finale was disappointing and pretty bad. however, the rest of the series was knockout tv, and i can kind of forgive the finale just because got still gave us those magnificent final seasons. 10/10"
2019-05-20,theolemag,Rewrite Season 8,7,"as the title states im not one bit happy about the ending of such an amazing show. something this great ruined, because of what? i can honestly not understand how they managed to screw this one up so horribly. everything, and i mean everything was on point except for the plot, writing and execution of the last 4 episodes. i really enjoyed the first 2 episodes of the season but since they for some reason decided to only do 6 and not 10 things got weird. it was such great buildup for what? expected death scene in the end? what happened to the bittersweet ending they had been talking about for i dont know how long? it really feels like a kids disneymovie, nothing bad with those, its just that thats not what thrones is, atleast not what it was..."
2019-04-06,dustinccquasis,Game of Thrones will go down in history as one of the best shows ever.,9,"stating that this show is going to be remembered as one of the best television shows in history is a bold statement, but in this case it is true.all i will say is that the acting is great, characters are not simply good or bad, the setting looks real, and the budget for the upcoming season is larger than most movies.my recommendation is that you should watch it and enjoy the ride."
2019-04-15,abedsamara,Come on people!!,10,"it had a lot of fillers, too much time wasting moments and for 60 minutes runtime that's a disappointment.i thought it would have more to it honestly!reunions are great but enough hollywood bs and let's get back the real got moments.i really hope the rest of the show isn't a bummer.not sure how they'll fit in the rest in 5 more episodes.6/10 and that's being kind"
2019-05-20,abedsamara,Started out great but ended horribly,1,"the first few seasons where amazing as they were based on the books, as the show started to advance and as the fewer material and content got the worse the show became, starting season 6 you can notice a clear decline in the quality of episodes, you can clearly notice the increase of time fillers up until season 8 which was the most horrible of them all. don't invest too much time on the series of you haven't started but just skip through the episode as some of the scenes are worth watching."
2019-05-20,crnnh,It's GAME OF THRONES,7,for real this the best show in history of movie industry it's a masterpiece absolutely don't let the bad work of d&d ruin it for you we loved the show so much until the end farewell got💔💔!

2011-06-24,warprayer,"Ambitious and stunning series, superbly executed",10,"game of thrones (got) is a large,scale fantasy series; the first part of the trilogy ""a song of ice and fire"" written by g.r.r. martin.basically, got is about several noble houses in the fantasy realm of westeros that struggle to keep or to gain power. the king, robert of the house baratheon, currently occupies the so-called iron throne, the seat of power in westeros. house lannister is rich, ruthless and power-hungry and is directly involved in the important political decisions, as cersei lannister is the wife of king robert.the starks of winterfell are rather loyal to the king and honorable in their duties. as the lord of winterfell, eddard ""ned"" stark, is called to serve the king, he and his family are thrown into a maelstrom of political intrigue and devious and dangerous people around the king's court.the house of targaryen is almost extinct, thanks to a war several years ago where robert baratheon claimed the throne in a rebellion against the king aerys targaryen. but 2 siblings, danaerys and viserys targaryen, managed to flee across the ""narrow sea"" escaping certain death. now they hatch plans to return to westeros and reclaim the iron throne.hbo took the challenge to put the 800 pages of the first novel to screen with 10 one-hour-episodes. and they did it brilliantly!what makes this tv series so interesting and fun to watch (besides the really good story) are the actors. almost all of them are great, especially the children (who play a vital role in the story). maisie williams (arya), jack gleeson (wonderful evil joffrey), richard madden (robb), isaac hempstead-wright (bran) and emilia clarke (danaerys) should be nominated for an emmy! a storyline, that didn't interest me that much while reading the books, is brought to life by emilia clarke's portrayal of danaerys targaryen. that says a lot about the quality of her performance.the ""adults"" are also well cast, special mention goes to sean bean as eddard ""ned"" stark and michelle fairley as his wife catelyn. peter dinklage as tyrion lannister is awesome, he really is tyrion.yes, there are maaany characters in the show; all the more it is stunning to see them blend in easily and interact with each other so well.so many story lines to follow and so many characters to remember, that can be difficult. but it's worth it, absolutely. the decisions the characters (sometimes have to) make result from a rather quiet beginning and stand-off between the houses to outright war and murder. at the end of season 1, the realm stands on the brink of chaos, as there are now several people who lay claim to the throne. the opening credits also deserve mentioning: they are gorgeous and come with an epic musical score. this intro changes in some episodes according to the locations where the current episode is playing. great idea.thank you hbo, and all people involved, for bringing this book alive on the tv-screen.i highly recommend watching this series and i'm looking forward to season 2!"
2019-05-21,pakman-24762,"A great start, awful ending. Stop watching at S4 (included).",8,"i wish i could rate it at 10. but the past 3 seasons get progressively worse as the source material dried up and the showrunners rushed the ending to jump to another project (disney's new star wars trilogy). the first 4 seasons are a solid 10. fifth and sixth ones are an 8. the seventh season is a 6. the fourth season gets worse with each episode, full of filler and lazy writing. there is none of the wit and soul found at the beginning of the series. it's a 3, being generous."
2019-05-21,ruslimshegebayev,For the Throne,8,"just after its release ""game of thrones"" instantly won the hearts of viewers all around the world what immediately guaranteed the series its roaring success.initially focused on fans of ""song of ice and fire"" ""game of thrones"" suddenly becomes one of the most popular projects on tv and soon the most popular tv show all over the world reaching extraordinary heights not only in series of this genre, but also on all tv.the creators of the series, as well as the author of the books, were able to recreate the incredible atmosphere absolutely not similar to anything else. the story with a lot of perfectly developed storylines, which often led to a completely unexpected for anyone consequences.this is a story with incredibly well,drawn characters, and they just seem so real! the action of the series is so exciting that you actually start to believe in dragons, giants and the white walkers!""game of thrones"" is not just a tv show, it's a whole universe, which is somehow similar to the real world and at the same time is absolutely different from any other series ever broadcasted on tv."
2019-04-27,andriantanandika,Brilliantly twisted!,9,this is how everyone should make a show! fantasy genre and yet still feel as realistic as it can be.
2019-05-22,sarraabbess,Masterpiece,10,"game of thrones, this show is the best ever for sure . it won't be forgotten. 8years , we lived with it , i'm sure i'm so lucky to exist when it exists. i feel like the characters are now my family , i'm so sad it ended , got thank you so much ❤"
2019-05-20,hoboflow,To the end of an era.,1,i hope i live long enough for another show with this much soul and depth to be created again. to the end of an era.
2019-05-20,bxceo-44207,my personal opinion,8,"i loved the show, it is my favorite show of all time and the end is hart warming my favorite season was 6 and i loved season 1 too and 7 was great"
2019-04-29,dimitrisfoussaras,Re-write it,10,"for god's sake please delete this episode, think it through and re,write it"
2019-05-06,blg-31847,Better research,9,"ok i love the show and episode 4 of season 8 was great but frustrating. i feel the writers really downplay the abilities of dragons and way over estimated the accuracy and power of the ballista. dragons for one have incredible vision, reflexes especially when flying, dragon armor( able to withstand almost any handheld human weapon, i would imagine valerian steel would be the exception)(would do minor damage from afar but major damage/kill close to very close up from a ballista )and they can breath fire as we have seen in a steep dive. when the ballista bolts were fired at dani on her attack she could have had the dragon breath fire which would have burnt the bolts to a cinder and slowed them down to nothing. while dani never lost any speed the odds of a ballista being able to hit a dragon in flight from far away even by surprise is still slim to none. never mine when a dragon can actually see them coming!!! also ballista have 3 minor faults which is why they stopped using them in history: the lack of power per distance;
poor distance ; reload times it took a crew of 2 just to crank the spring into firing position. so sorry guys but you totally mad that entire sea battle look stupid. also those ballista bolts would never have done that kind of damage to those ships from that distance ever maybe at 50 to 80 yards but not a quarter a mile away.
lastly why would danny run away all she would have had to do was fly around them and hit the black fleet from the rear where they're defenseless??? sorry for the rant it's my first ever criticism of the show but i felt it was a big flaw in the writing."
2019-04-30,larisaspecter,Dope!!!,9,to all people out there if you haven't watched game of thrones then your life ain't complete !!
2019-06-11,mohammadszzr,got,1,gooooood story and the worst finish for this serie
2019-05-01,ihebcheghib,The best serie evet,1,"i've seen a lot of series , but none of them impressed me like got did"
2019-05-01,celebisemih,logic errors were too much,10,"war tactics, ridiculous defense, survival of some people and many other nonsense"
2019-06-14,hadi_spiderboy,Game of thrones,10,"despite the ending, this is a must watch and will ruin tv for you due to its fascinating set of characters and how they evolve and the story. when it finished i was heartbroken and wanted more out of it.
props to the cast, writers, and hbo for this, i don't think any tv show over will top this.
even though i hoped for a different ending for the story we love you got!"
2019-05-20,brockhbieber,Dopeness,10,"amazing, perfect writing. perfect coreography, perfect cgi. the perfect showw"
2019-05-03,kattrosa,Everything has a purpose! This is the best show of all time.,8,"s8e3 the battle of winterfell was 120 min of amazing my heart didn't stop pounding even the second time watching. the creators and stories tellers set up so many things for this episode. first, it appears jon snow is distracting the blue dragon so arya can enter the area where the night king is, because the dragon is blocking/protecting that entrance. watching the second time and reviewing multiple clips you can hear jon say ""go, go go"" screaming in front of the dragon. second, the epic killing of the nk with arya was perfect. in s8e2, arya sneaks up on jon snow undetected in the exact same spot, so she knows she can do it. she has been preparing for this moment for so many years and has the skill set to do it. she now has shut brown eyes and blue eyes forever. next on her list is green eyes !!!!!!!"
2019-05-20,thanujatsk,Don't betray your watch❤😥,8,"i see many people have rate 1 for this episode. ending may be not what ""some"" people expected.but it was a great show.it brought us joy,sadness.tought us many lessons.
we should be grateful for that.
also i knw many people who rate 1 is haven't watch a single episode,who do this to troll.

2019-05-05,emily-14487,Gets boring after season 5,10,doesn't rely on books anymore. became like a hollywood movie. it is sad really. ~emily
2019-05-06,ravenpr,GOT S8E3 Magnificent!,8,"an extremely captivating, heart,pounding, edge of your seat episode! beautiful cinematography with magnificent special effects. some notable moments were presented like paintings: the flamed swords dorthraki charge, jorah and ghost with fireballs in the sky, and dragons in the moonlight. every character had ""facing death"" moments of fight or flight (run for your life). hats off to jorah, theon, lady mormont, and the red woman. arya proved, yet again, she is the best combination of assassin and warrior. the episode mvp and best kill trophy goes to arya of house stark."
2019-05-07,composer-78600,So Much Dissapointed,10,"i watched this series almost 8 years. and waited the finale for 2 years.
i watched every seasons more than 5 times.
this series was the most thrilling thing in my life and the writers has just ruined it.
i'm so sad and so angry. i never rated in imdb before but i'm giving this 1.
good bye ghost, rhaegal and good bye to game of thrones."
2019-05-08,cengizberketurkay,;((((((((,10,i am so sad they messed up my favourite tv serieeeee
2019-05-21,amanjrekar-59643,And My Watch has Ended but In a Pathetic Way..!!💔,1,"this show easily could have been best ever but sadly it will be remembered as great show with the worst ending ever. in every aspect such as acting, direction, cinematography, background music, writing (till season 6), dialogues, vfx, artwork etc this show is masterpiece.
the reason i liked this show very much was they pulled of the balance between fantasy world and real world brilliantly. but sadly they failed to give the conclusion in both aspects. all the build up of plot and character arcs throughout first 6 season was destroyed within few moments in last 2 seasons because of hilarious writing of d&d who i think lost their imagination skills after they got out of books.
in the end i would say this show deserved more seasons to conclude the storyline of westeros and every character in it."
2019-05-16,rshamsi,7 seasons,6,game of thrones has only 7 seasons. this rating is for those 7 seasons. and if i would pick a rating for first amazing 5 seasons it would be 10! shame on those pat and mat who ruined this masterpiece.
2019-05-20,shrimps-1997444,Really sad,10,"look, seasons 1,6 were possibly 6 of the greatest seasons television has ever seen. nothing *nothing* will ever be able to take that away (thank you grrm) but i'm just really sad about the significant drop in writing over the last two seasons. got has always been about character decision and those decisions deciding the fate of the show. the last two seasons, especially this one, just seem like d&d just wrote don't a check list of things they want to put in the show and sloppily put each one in. and in doing so had uncharacteristic lines, teleportation and over the top foreshadowing. this is the first review i've ever written and i just want to say, i'm just really sad :/ thank you game of thrones for 7 or so years of entertainment, just a little disappointed with the last couple."
2019-05-13,amirkiangh,Storyline,10,perfect and they gather everything so nice and good ending
2019-05-13,ziizaaww,Great at the beginning but the last season 👎🏾,10,"the first 6 seasons are perfect 7 is meh
8 is absolute trash"

2019-05-18,ismaeel_da,The greatest show ever,9,i just love this show and i hope everyone to enjoy watching it ................best show ever
2019-05-22,infinityy,"Incredible show, Favourite, However...",2,"i'd give a 9.5 if i could..so i'm giving a 10 because seasons 1,4 were amazing and season 5 and 6 were great. very, very addictive. very intense, writing at it's best, and characters at their most amiable. seasons 1-6 are why game of thrones is known for being the best tv show.season 7 is good, the writing was decent, yet started to fall a bit from there.most of you will have heard the fans arn't pleased about season 8.. the production team, the cast and the acting was still brilliant as always, no shame on them. the writing seriously falls low, and that's where the problems are with the final season. there's only 6 episodes in season 8, and they really needed the full 10 that was offered to make the ending make sense with a few alterations with character directions.seasons 1-4, 10/10season 5, 8.5/10season 6, 9.5/10season 7, 7.5/10season 8, 4/10"
2019-05-14,jeswanishubham,"GOT is the ""Me Too"" of TV world",10,"how do you write an interesting story? simple, you screw the story and focus on writing surprising moments instead and try to connect these moments by your so called great story. got, from season 6, has been following this formula and people are stupid enough to believe such a pathetic storyline. this series started like a political drama with ned stark loosing his head and slowly they turned it in to magic land where jon snow returns from being dead if that's what the writers think is most surprising for the audience."

2019-05-21,zainabmz,Don't know what to say,10,everything was perfect and amazing till season 8 its a disaster.. i'd give 10 without season 8 but 6 with the season
2019-05-15,jamouseman,Seasons 8 destroyed The Show,10,"the stories are no longer logical, the characters have become very superficial, the dialogues silly, the way haw characters die, do not resemble game of thrones, it is not got any more ."
2019-05-15,alialoshaa,game of trones graet,10,it was a great war and it is a war worth seeing because it was interesting and the filming accuracy is excellent

2019-05-21,ahmad-95407-42858,Legendaryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,9,the most breathe taking shocking dramatic action comedy heart stopping show in the history of all mankind and human beings
2019-05-17,katefedso,Breathtaking TV Despite Criticism,10,"despite the recent criticism of season 8, game of thrones is still breathtaking tv and highly entertaining. some plot holes do exist but still a spectacle to watch."
2019-05-19,amfahbg,The End,9,think after the taking about the last episode from the directors and all the other it will be perfect episode with that all we all will know who will take the iron throne
2019-05-19,drlaurabirceanu-80361,Horrifying season 8,9,"hudge got fan. i would rate it 11, if possible. the 5 is for season 8 alone. awful script. dead awful. could we have a season 8 remake? i have waited two years for this."
2019-05-19,taylormv,Amazing,10,"this show is probably one of the best shows out there. great plot and characters, love it, would watch it again."

2019-05-20,jimloesel,Don't get invested. The last season ruins the whole thing.,10,"first 6 seasons. 10/10 season 7 : 7/10
season 8: 2/10"
2019-05-20,abbess-23817,Season 8,10,i loved game of thrones up until season 8. the detailed story telling died before cersei and daenerys. this was very lackluster and disappointing.
2019-05-20,rubytransson,Awesome,6,i love it it's was so good until season eight happened lol
2019-05-20,djahmed-30366,Good or Bad,2,it is supposed to be one of the best serials in history but in its last seasons it did not give us what was expected of it
2019-05-20,hag-83677,The Best I Ever Seen,10,briefly this show is what other shows need to learn from. it's the reference that the history will never forget
2019-05-20,khaymantis,They Rian Johnson'd the Last Season,9,"i wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. i'd highly recommend the books though. first 5 of so seasons were great, then steady was the decline, until the final season when it just becomes a disjointed, character breaking, no character staying true to their arc, jumbled mess. still not as bad as the last jedi on how to ruin a beloved series, but pretty damn close."
2019-05-21,ryambaqer,The best,9,thank youuuu for this series! waiting for the new project🤤
2019-05-20,elilrani,Don't put all your eggs into the basket.,10,"that was what i did. seasons 1 to 4 were absolutely magnificent. engaging plot, intriguing characters, twists you don't see coming but in hindsight spot the breadcrumbs leading up to them. chemistry! pacing! intelligent!season 5 was a little bit draggy but had its outstanding moments especially hardhome. season 6 in my opinion was slightly better and on par with seasons 1 to 4. season 6 also had the only satisfactory stark reunion.season 7 was when they started talking about bigger budgets and better cgi. honestly, not worth the sacrifice. daenerys and jon's love story felt completely unrealistic and played up. the most memorable scene was danny & co absolute belief they were going to overthrow cersei... cut to that epic highgarden scene. so yes, one or two moments but bad taste in your mouth.season 8 was a goddamn fail. like every fan can attest to. i saw a comment saying how fans are so ungrateful, asking if we can write any better. why yes, yes i can. some flaws : cersei, wasted. jaime, wasted. euron, overdone. rhaegal (dragon), wasted. bronn, wasted. sam, wasted. ghost, wasted. sansa, wasted. gendry, wasted. varys, wasted and overdone. sorry, i'm choking up just naming these dreadful characterisations.the music is god tier fantastic, as is directing, props and costumes, as well as acting."
2019-05-21,aascis,D&D lost it.,10,"characters jumped around like chess pieces, very disappointing."
2019-05-21,kinggeoffrey,Thank You HBO.,10,"thank you, hbo. just thank you, for making this a reality and delivering in spades.
a truly wonderful show that will never be forgotten.
from the tiniest of details to the grandest of landscpaes, pure escapism.
nothing is ever perfect, and this is no exception, but my word is it close.
bravo to all. you've given the world a gift to be revered for time immemorial."
2019-07-19,waqarboi,Great Show with Worst possible ending.,9,overall i would say it was the best show to watch but the way they just ended the show even after taking an extra year for season 8 they still just ruined the ending specially the last 2 episodes it appears to be the worst possible ending. i have watched every season more than once but after this ending my interest for got is over they just ruined their show.
2019-05-21,moodyblu-53886,"It came, we saw it, and I wished Game of Thrones had conquered",10,"an episode of the middling sort. a bit of anguish, a bit of fun and a lot of ash. the end of game of thrones proved that this was, in the end, just a tv show.. not the great performance about power and the human experience, that we thought it would be.a wonderful story that in the end faltered and stumbled. it was a show that in the early seasons demanded we appreciate it for its complexity and intricate detail...now it is being judged for its watered,down, and too rushed take on this story.my wish! i do wish, that king bran's first order of the day was to find meera reed and humbly thank her: meera reed, warrior and queen-of-dragging-for-years suffered so that bran could live to be king and only got a, cold 'ok, thanks'. meera... the north remembers! we remember, even though bran and the showrunners forgot.and finally...
honestly, exactly how many unsullied and dothraki survived the battle of winterfell?
8 seasons of disparate rulers never agreeing on much and fighting to the death for power... but now they all agree to appoint bran as king in under 10 minuts..."
2019-05-21,dougpat83,Because of season 8 (and 7),10,1 yes because it makes no sense to watch 8 seasons of a show for that result. used to be a 10. now it's a 0 !!!i love breaking bad and got and i couldn't have picked my favourite before.but i realize now that breaking bad was just on a huge higher lever !thanks for the first 6 seasons .... f for the last 2
2019-05-21,rosskelly-32660,The bench mark for future epic tv shows,10,"let me start by saying yes the last season was rushed an should've been extended to 2 to let the characters take there time an explain why they chose there action , but up until season 7 it's as close to perfection as you can get for a tv show .ive read the books so i understand they had to cut a lot out .its just not possible to keep it all in .so what they did was pretty much as good as they could've done .its smart , shocking , exciting with a good but rushed ending .an what makes it so good is no character is completely good they all feel real . this show is a must for any one that likes a clever epic story"
2019-05-21,mido-79156,The best ever,9,its the best of the best i will never listen to a perfect soundtracks like this
2019-05-21,drk_iskpro,To be brilliant you have to be consistent,10,"works of art are a whole. you can't start brilliantly and end up with a mess of a show, poorly written and full of bad decitions, with happens to be the case of game of thrones, the most disappointing and boring finale ever written."
2019-05-21,anadarabanhbl,The best tv show with the WORST ending,10,i cant belive it!!!shame on you d&d and shame hbo for alowing this to happen!!!!i cant belive i have waited so long to see this????are you kidding me????the worst season i have ever seen!!!i hated so much the ending i cant rate it any better than this.sorry y'all and sorry for all of us devoted fans that had to see this happening
2019-05-22,cappacappa-28450,High quality all around,10,"gave 9 stars only because of the last season. great actings all the way except one female actor, great story, unbelievable quality of filmin."
2019-05-22,valentingeorgiev-87505,One of the best TV Shows,1,"i started watching this tv show occasionally, because of sean bean who i really like as an actor. i was amazed of the story line. episode after episode, season after season everything got better and better. the shocking element in the scenario became like a trade mark for g.r.r.martin. but after the 6,th season i felt some stagnation on every level. the show became less emotional, less rational, less intriguing. in season 7 the story passed ssooooo slowly, almost painfully slowly without anything special happening. only the last 2 episodes was really valuable. season 8 was the opposite - very rushed, full of plot holes, mistakes (including simple ones like mineral water bottles, coffee cups, ets). the remaining characters ""acquired"" plot armor, just like batman :d. the 'realism' of the story faded. it is obvious that it was done without much enthusiasm. it was like ""let's finish it as soon as possible"". i get it that d&d now have a big, greater project as ""star wars"" but this is not excuse. so my general rating for all the seasons is 7/10. because the value of a story depends very much on the end of this story. and the end of got story was not very good and meaningful, neither emotional or shocking or surprising."
2019-05-22,saoking,"Lets not take down the respect that the cast, cinematography and the soundtrack composers deserves!",1,"i do agree that season 8 was a huge letdown, but the writters are the ones to blame...even so i maintain my opinion that this show was one of the best shows ever created so far, the cast was flawless, the soundtrack gave me the chills that i didnt had since lotr, and the cinematography was really accurate.i think a lot of people are overreacting with their reviews...yes, like i said the season 8 was a huge letdown, everything was rushed when they had material for at least 1 more season with at least 10 episodes. but what we can take from here is the amazing experience that this show had offered to us all these years with the previous seasons.its definitely a tv show to be remember for a lot of years to come."
2019-05-23,stormborn1971,Best show ever - ignore the season 8 moaners,10,"i don't agree with the maelstrom of hate that the 8th season, and in particular the final episode, has generated.it wraps up pretty much all of the plot points of any consequence and provides a view of the future for all of the surviving key players.ok, these futures might not be the ones i (or many other people) would have wanted but hey, if every show/story went the way i wanted it to there would be no such thing as chick flicks, reality tv or quiz shows.granted, some minor things didn't get resolved and this has upset many people but i personally couldn't give a crap about arya's white horse, not actually seeing people walk to and from places, where drogon took dany's body to, how the dothraki could hear dany's nazi speech or how they got home after her death, how the words ""several weeks or months later"" didn't appear before the post,war meeting, how i don't know the name of the new dornish prince, what the unsullied plan to do on naath, where davos's wife has gone blah blah blah. in much the same way that i don't give a crap how the first death star only has about 10 tie fighters or how dr strange managed to transport heroes he'd never seen or met to the same place in avengers endgame.when all is said and done, a fantastic show (arguably the best ever) has provided millions with wonderful entertainment for many years and the hate it now receives is pitiful."

2019-05-25,jackpronol,Dissapointing season 8,6,i think directors just wanted to finish this series they didnt want to make a marvelous finish to make a great series in this genre. this finishing was a disrespectful gratitude to all followers of got.
2020-03-27,hasadbeigi,Last season,10,last season destroyed everything. i think this series is 10 star. until tje last season released
2019-05-26,kjartantp,Season 8 f it up :(,10,love the show but this final wtf :( i would give it 10 if not for season 8
2019-05-28,swcurtis-72811,I didn't like it,10,thou i am a huge fan of game of thrones i believed that this show didn't really hook me as some others did. though the action was good i didn't really find interest in any of the characters meaning no change
2019-05-29,wulkano,Fight fire with fire,10,"im here to support attack on titan, also the last 2 seasons were trash, like, really trash"
2019-05-29,dumindamadhusanka,Best TV Series Ever,10,"daenerys targaryen died in the game of thrones finale, but is it possible she could come back to life? from the night king to jon snow's season 6 revival, there's plenty of ways for the dead to return in game of thrones. we already outlined a somewhat fantastical theory explaining how dany could come back to life, but a recently spotted easter egg from the series finale is giving us even more hope that it really could happen."
2019-05-29,amanosalt,Disappointed..,10,great series to watch but the worst and most disappointing ending..
2019-06-21,ayushlimbu,"Except for the last season, the show is my favorite",10,"seasons 1,7 kept me hooked, in fact the whole world was crazy over it. but the way they rushed in the final season was very disappointing. they seemed to be in a rush to end this. the favorite episodes i had on the final season were episode 2, 3 and 6. i know some people don't agree on episode 6 being a good one, but the chaos was comparatively less. and i liked the way they showed how arya was traveling the world, just like her character demands. she is not someone who would look good being a lady or somebody's wife. jon was sent back to the wall, which in some way or the other reunites him with ygritte. and sansa as queen in the north was so good. daenerys and cersei could have some real good set of dialogues together. episode 4, and 5 were really rushed. in short, the seriesust be watched, but the final season was not impressive"
2019-06-20,mrrbiertm,Great tv show,10,"greatest of all time, the story the characters
this is great"
2019-06-04,abodiaman,Watched it,10,"i started got and have watched all episodes in 2 weeks. the first 6 seasons watched them in a week, but the 7,8 took me a whole week and the reason was like everyone saying it disappointed us. 6 out of 8"
2019-06-05,tereovando,excellent but ruined by the end,10,"i would have scored it with a 10 if the end had not treated the best characters so disrespectfully. it was devastating to see a forced end, steamed, and also did not honor the great previous development of the characters"
2019-06-05,kaushalkishoresharma,"1-6 awesome, 7-8 too fast",10,"overall masterpiece work , yet little quick in last 2 seasons but still happy to watch it ."
2020-12-29,diana_10,"Besides everything, one of the best shows ever.",10,"i am disappointed just as anyone else with season 8, but after everything i've seen there's no way i'm not giving this show a 10. the cast? incredibly talented and perfect for their character, the locations, special effects and editing? outstanding. the characters were evolving trough each season (at least till the 7th) and they had the time and space to change, the story is really interesting and every time there's something else or someone else new to the story.
robb's death was the hardest for me, i can forgive this and other events cause they gave the story something, but i can't forgive suddenly making daenerys evil after building her as someone who did not want to hurt innocents and i can't forget the fact that jon is a targareyn and yet that fact did not have an impact in the story. but besides everything i can't think of any other show with such quality (for 7 seasons) and i had some of the best (and most painful not gonna lie) moments watching this show without getting boring and i think that this shows deserves more respect."
2019-06-08,simonebelcher,30 hours of wasted time.,10,gave up after 3 seasons. every episode was pretty dull and then would end on a cliff hanger to draw you in to the next episode. just pointless and so over hyped it's unreal.
2019-06-09,olivergt,2 different shows,10,"season 1,4 of game of thrones is the pinnacle of television. season 5-8 is a completely different show, with moronic character arcs and pointlessly forced expectation subversion. i'm going to continue to do what the vast majority of the fanbase does, and pretend that season 5-8 doesn't exist."
2020-05-11,gggggg-73843,Masterpiece,10,"despite disappointing season 8, this is the greatest tv show ever!!! do not believe any of those negative reviews. i honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating."
2019-06-10,mehdiima,Acceptable and awesome!,7,"it was a good end but i think it may continue
i think aria will find a big zone and start his empire!"
2020-01-19,mikeafonso,It was my favorite show...,10,"i was invested from season 1 to 6. in season 7 i thought it was still really good, but something was missing. and then season 8 hit and it was just the most disappointing thing i have ever seen..."
2019-06-15,mariuca-83336,Dissapointing,9,"seasons 1,6 were good but just certain characters had good stories and were interesting, too many characters, too many plots, it was very boring. in season 7 basically nothing happened, it could've just been 1 episode and season 8, no comment."
2021-09-06,lemkeleop,I wish everyone who rated this before season 8 would update his rating,10,the ending is so bad that even the good seasons arent watcheble anymore.thank you for less than nothing d&d.
2019-06-24,uchka-97015,The best we have,10,"even tough the ending was not what we all expected, it is only the best tv series we have."
2019-11-10,itsmalay,Epic...best tv series has ever been made,10,"cast, storyline, acting, direction, screenplay, plots, bgm, soundtracks everything was just epic... not only the north, the whole world will remember..!"
2020-02-11,ddcemailme,Just about better than any thing ever made for television...........,10,"having never read any of the game of thrones novels, i went into this series not knowing anything of the story. that could of been a plus. i really liked lord of the rings trilogy. the movies directed by peter jackson. that was excellent. so, i'm into fantasy.overall, game of thrones has a great script, a superb cast, outstanding real locales where it was filmed, and so many twists and turns you will never guess what will happen next. for me it turned into a binge watching ordeal. it took me 3 weeks to view all 8 seasons. no regrets.a fantastic escape from reality....................."
2019-07-11,dbjosoniv,One of the best tv shows,10,got has got to be one the best tv shows out there the problem is that the last season felt rushed and many questions are still unsolved. i felt that the story became a drag during season 4 then it became good again after season 6. could have been the greatest if only they could turn back time lol.
2019-07-21,lenamoon-16674,this is so good,10,"i love it, wanna see another season of game of thrones"
2019-07-23,sanbusivam,Don't know whether I will like anything else hereafter,10,loved the series to the max. few episodes in the last season were bit slow. but the ending was nice. i seriously don't know whether i will like anything else(movie or series) ever hereafter to this extent. satisfied to the max. never had been addicted to any series before but with this one. started with breaking bad after this but miss got very much. got has set a benchmark for series or movies which is hard to achieve for ever.
2019-07-23,shrivastavas-79902,Greatest of all Time,10,"it is greatest of all time but, ending is not great. the main characters dont end up where they should be. still if you haven't seen it, you haven't seen everything in life."
2019-07-27,nicholascampbell-77548,Nuff said,10,best show to ever air on television period and i'm a big television power
2011-06-18,brothergrymm,Amazing Series!,9,"okay, i am having trouble understanding how people can write all the negative stuff about this show, generally the negative reviews are after only one episode.this show is simply amazing.i think the casting was incredible. peter dinklage was the only person who could have played tyrion, and man, it was better than i could have ever hoped. sean bean is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint in this. i was somewhat surprised at the portrayal of visaerys being so, wimpy, but then again i haven't read the books in years.i'm not going to try and persuade people to like this series. all i am saying is to give it a try, and watch a few episodes. if you just watch the first episode, you won't understand much at all. watch a few episodes, and then you can have a good idea of what is going on (although there are so many twists and turns in the plot, you'll never know what is going to happen.) also, yes there is violence and nudity. i will say that the first episode has more of the latter than the subsequent episodes, so don't just throw the series out for that reason alone."
2019-08-02,mennalhasan,Overrated,10,i couldn't understand what really make people love this show. it's just a waste of time.
2019-10-08,bartvaneck,How tf is this rated higher than LOTR?!,9,"this is litterly inspirid by lotr and the hobbit for the the most part.. and its rated higher, lol no way."
2019-08-21,belkhirmohamed-36963,The best tv show ever,10,"1,6 season are amazing the 7th season good but not like the first six seasons and the 8th is disappointing but overall it's the best tv show that i have ever seen"
2019-08-24,jessykabkk,Brilllian writting,10,"i watched rerun again after all many years waiting. the rerun made made me understand all are connected story and actually planning from the start! so barvo brillion writting on the script. just the final season you could extend it a bit longer for intense ... dannie went too quick wild,"
2019-08-24,jessykabkk,Brilliant writing!!!,8,"i first watch got and we waited for year till we forgot what and why and when i watch rerun (consecutive series again) i feel it s brilliant writing!!!! everything s connected at the begginig hint without be,able to forecast! this series s great and i want to crap my hands to the writer! the story s so connected to the end. i thought u change the plot as you want to excite the audiences but seemed like u know what to end! just only the final season s disappointed coz you could extended danaial crazy and intense with cercies more. too quick! otherwise got will be perfect at the end!!!"
2021-02-20,prashantkedri,I hope we will never see a thing like Game of Thrones,10,i hope we will never see a thing like game of thrones
2019-09-01,fhbyousuf,"Same review as everyone: Season 1-6 best of all! Season 7 is a bit flaw but still good and okay, 8? Disappointing",10,"i considered got as the best series of all time, and i would still consider it the best, but season 8 changed my mind. season 1 to 6: just one word, outstanding. extreme and intelligent dialogues, unbelievably creative, mind blowing surprise scenes, unpredictable and world class things. too good. especially after watching season 6, you may die because of too much excitement and hype. this six seasons will get 3000 out of 10 from me.
season,7: well the plot start to have some flaws as it didn't had any in last 6 seasons. questions start to hit into minds and inconsistency in the characters can be seen. still somehow can be said good because only of the show environment and because the season 6 was too good so you can simply overlook those little flaws in the show. this season will still get 8 out of 10 from me.
season-8: the worst part. the reason which made this legendary piece of show into complete disaster. worst ending i have ever seen in any show! disappointing, simply disappointing. even 0 out of 10 is much, it deserves minus points"
2019-10-23,etsipa,Dreadful finale,10,"what a dreadful, lazy and rushed finale. very disappointing!"
2021-10-25,sudhakarsundar-46670,GOT is Masterpiece,10,"greatest show even seen my life ?ans: yeah game of thronesthe best series onethe novelist and writer geroge martin outstanding on ""a song of ice and fire"" based inspire on gotdirectors and creators superb one.story plat, screen play, dialogues awasome one.character development : was outstanding one my favs top 3: daenerys targeriyan , jon snow , cercei outstanding onemusic dept : sound editing , sound fixing , bgms , and original sound track another pluse point and awosamespecial one : series cinematography was awesome experience big screen maximum live location was outstanding one and visuals goat onetech dept : cgi , vfx, sfx, greenmate, movies cuts was perfectly one originally show on big screen superb onedesigners : costume designer, makeup designer, set designer was awesome onethe greatest show life watch game of thrones series best one and goat., and season by season very engaging one perfect and twist and turn is not predictable very well.so must watch catagory one so watch it now
i'm 10/10 and watch it put it 10 rating."
2020-09-13,gdeepanja,winter was a joke.,10,"in final season j. snow, dragon quine was a joke. all the time sansa was a another joke. but finally she was the lady of the north.first four seasons like a dragon.
season five and six like a lion.
season seven and eight like a fly."
2021-05-27,zharuss,Masterpiece from season 1 to 6.,10,"season 1 until the 6th was perfect, even so some things are not equal to the books, they still kept the series so great that i couldn't hate any of it. the only problem was after the 6th season, it wasn't very bad, but it can't even compare to the predecessor seasons. i'll give an 10 overall."
2019-11-08,willhasselbusch,Greatest show (most of the time),1,"game of thrones seasons 1,6 are some of the greatest seasons on television. the story remains captivating and exciting, and the characters are equal parts likeable and hateable. game of thrones deserved much better than the last seasons, and even though the ending is trash, its still so worth the ride. if you'd like, stop watching after season 6, its a fine open ended ending for the series."
2020-02-23,lewisrobinson-75916,Should be 10 but...,10,"a story so good and well written, with barely a misplaced piece of screenplay or direction, for six seasons at roughly a dozen episodes per should have the highest rating possible.the seventh season was a taste of things to come but i actually thought it was good.however the eighth season is objectively terrible. it is an insult not just to the brilliance of the previous seasons, but it is also an insult to us, the viewer, and the producers should be ashamed.with the godfather films, it is possible to forget the third film even exists... which is what i do. the ending of the second film is perfect.it is also possible to forget the latest star wars trilogy exists, because again they are objectively bad.with all that said, the worst thing about game of thrones, is that the final episode of season seven can't be the end of the story. one must either forget the entire show, or soldier through the worst ending to what was probably the best television programme ever made.or. hope that george martin rights the disgraceful wrongs of season eight in the final books.please george hear me. do something to fix this."
2019-11-08,vakvag,Best of all,1,the best series i have ever seen! i have seen this series twice. very good actors. the ending could of course be better. we expect the prequel as well.
2019-11-22,pinkflower-99179,Epic and undeniably one of the best shows in TV history,9,"i used to be one of those...""oh it's all about fighting and it's based in the past...theres too much sex..and i dont need to watch this kind of stuff"" type of person. i used to believe i could only find joy in my usual typical tv shows..you know the countless reality shows we have nowadays. but little did i know that i was missing out on the adventure with this show!my husband forced me to watch it. i was apprehensive. after the slow start of the first episode
..i was hooked! creative writing..stellar direction..thought provoking dialogue and also where there wasnt any dialogue..alot was said..making the scenes and plot line that much stronger.the actors were all unique in their own way. if an actor can force you to hate them..have mixed feelings about them..or have great passion towards them...then you know you've got a great cast!i will forever chant the mantra of got to those who have yet to explore this world!! so go..please explore the wonders of got and become engrossed in its charm! ( give it two episodes though to build up )."
2020-04-23,imshaheryar,Next Level Series,5,"i've been hearing and so much talk about got from my friends and i watched in 2020, when i started then i watch a single season per day continuously."
2020-01-26,thanasizer,Overal critic,9,"1,6 it was the perfect show... there was everything that fans wants to see. violence intrigue, political games , wars, knights , good story and much more. there was perfect dialogs but as soon as they started to move away from martin's writings the show lost his hype.
season seven is just good , season eight for me is garbage.
but still is a tottaly worth watching show"
2019-12-22,ordiosw,Quite simple series,8,"nothing interesting, lots of nudity and humiliation, quite simple story to be honest. i'm not impressed. i've seen the witcher couple of days ago and it's much better then this..."
2019-12-25,jamomatt-55021,Started off good...,10,first few seasons were fantastic. then the story turned to crap.
2021-06-27,kalebpugsley,The perfect show that ended in absolute disaster,9,"the last season destroyed the show. rewatch value is zero. i don't understand how i can go from being absolutely obsessed to wishing i never watched the series in less than 1 year.someone in the very distant future will have to come back and redo the whole show to fix this, hopefully i'm still alive to see it."
2019-12-26,jorgeluis-49368,Chaotic last season.,2,"i am a great game of thrones fan, i saw every season ,at least- three times (season 7 and 8 not included). i love every dialogue, every character, environment, everything. i got half of my family watching it, and they adored it.now, the two disagreeable, rotten, abominable, and horrendous seasons: how the hell did they make it? they had everything to give us the ending that the series deserved, but they greatly destroyed our hopes. they gave us what no one spected: a miserable ending, with no good development, no good script, no good at all.there are no words that could explain how disappointed we, got fans, are. hbo could have even watched some theories made by fans, they're all over youtube, and that would have guided them to a better ending, and any other ending could have been much better than the one they made..."
2021-05-24,siddhantbang,Game of thrones belongs to only daenerys targaryen,10,"when you end this series you only remember daenerys targaryen's sacrifices , beauty , loyalty , madness and the justice she never got from got."
2020-07-24,raviluijbregts-20649,I am so happy i bought this,9,i bought all the seasons for 109 euro a super deal i watched it all the way
2020-07-06,rullstolsnisse-95459,"If you give it some time, it grows and gets excellent.",8,"there are a lot of reviews here being quite emotional. a lot of talks about last season etc.( don't fear the last season. it's about the bigger picture )however, if you haven't seen the series it's a mesmerizing display of different medieval family houses. you will have to invest some patience in season one, but it's worth it as this somewhat stale introduction is necessary to apply bigger depth to characters and the storyline.you might spend 15 minutes pausing to google family trees and maps to see whom is whom, what is what and where is where. but then again it's all worth it as this ends up being one of this decades absolute ""must,watch"" in the tv-series world. hbo biggest success along with breaking bad."
2020-01-25,ajay-44941,Great show must watchable,7,i just finish full series yesterday and i like the show very much but many people say that ending is not great but the main platform of the show was on the basis of the where the show start . in last season there is some slowness in series but it can be acceptable ending satisfy of the series very good series looking forward to next hbo house of dragon
2020-02-18,vhdvivek,Best thing from S1E1 till S8E5,10,entire series is mind blowing. you just can't watch one episode and leave the series half way. loved it. i also do not criticize the last two seasons as much as the hype is created on the web. i just think the last episode of the last season is useless. just consider the series ended at episode 5 of last season and you will live the rest of your life with peace of mind.
2020-09-18,abpradeep,My favourite series,10,the last season is a complete ruin i agree. but i enjoyed the westros so much that even the disappointment in the end doesn't make me feel anything bad about got. it's just the writers' fault as they ran out of source material for the last 2 seasons. but this was the series that hooked me so much and you can't watch without falling in love with it. everything was so good at the start and even without a satisfying ending... idc i love got and moreover the cast was perfect... just perfect.. i love game of thrones and i'll watch anything that will come in the future related to that. thank you! have a nice day btw :)
2021-05-25,jackhadley-06346,"Messy, but very strong",10,"the acting, production design, cinematography, and overall presentation is some of the best in television history. i want to give a particular shoutout to sophie turner, jack gleason, and emilia clarke for some of the best performances in any tv show i've ever seen. however the overall storytelling can be a bit messy at times. there's a lot of plot holes and empty side plots that were frustrating to sit through. the final season was also super disappointing because of how they betrayed a lot of the character arcs they had been building up for seven seasons. those faults are more than made up for by a mostly great story that was both emotional and exciting. i highly recommended this show."
2020-09-19,mehdialirezaei-02648,The best of the world,10,this series is so awsome the best series of the world
2020-03-13,avatarsilverstar,Best Ever!,10,keep creating series like this! even if it takes a year for 10 episodes people will wait and love even more :)

2020-04-23,fauxgolemsays,Awful ending that breaks your heart. 9 stars?,10,"when jon in the last episode told tyrion : ""i'm sorry it came to this"" , i felt that. you felt that. we all felt that. idk why i ended up giving 9 stars. prolly because i fell in love with the show. yes it was ruined at the end, but many of the episodes were the best on tv. i was heartbroken after the finale but it is what it is. 9 stars for all the amazing actors and crew out there who played their hearts out. and the missing 1 star? well earn it,d&d."

2021-10-03,senapatel,Best quality content,6,"could had been better, i wish they could had hired few more creative consultants to make itr even better there was scope.i did not like blood scenes could had been a little nicer."
2020-04-25,bcostas,Likely the best show ever ... except for S8,5,"normally i would not be as big a fan for ""fantasy"" type content, and in fact avoided this show for 4 years until my son bought me season 1 for x,mas. i was hooked by the second episode. no news here, but to say this is likely the most solid all around series ever, and how the last season was so inexplicably poor is still hard for me to understand. many have suggested a ""do over"" which is obviously not happening, but it does leave a very bad taste after 7 very strong seasons. for a series that crashed and burns on landing, i'm still having to recommend it for all of the positive content."
2020-06-13,princesingh-41571,Best series ever!,10,i recommend you to watch at least few episodes before giving your reviews
2020-05-01,aloneboyhriday,Great show,9,it was a great viewing experience if you exclude the last season.
2020-11-10,meedo-49056,Masterpiece,10,"generally speaking, this show is the best show that my eyes have seen. it's really hard to make a book or a series of books into a tv show but got has done absolutely that and more. the work that has been put into it is astonishing and breathtaking. the cinematography, soundtracks, scenery, cgi, and the cast are all absolutely stunning in every way. i like to think of it as more than a show. i like to see it as a work of art that keeps getting better and better every season. until, of course, season 8. season 8 was great in all the ways mentioned above except for the story itself and how it was executed. 7 seasons of character development were thrown out of the window. if it weren't for season 8, this show would be sitting on the throne of tv shows with with no other show to compete except for #2 best show. nonetheless, a great show that will forever be engraved in my heart and memories."

2021-09-14,chrehman-53493,Outstanding,10,"i like such programmes and suggest my friends to watch them. i am not against movies, dramas or dance shows but we should watch such programmes that increase our practical knowledge. a lot of thanks to hbo for such a nice programme."
2020-08-30,iggymosdav,"After Season 8, I Don't Recommend You Watch This...",10,"seasons 1 and 2 were good, but admitingly, a bit boring. seasons 3 and 4 are two of the best seasons of television that i've ever seen. genuinely perfect in every way. season 5, while being a drastic decrease in quality, was still mildly entertaining. season 6 went back to being pretty great and is a personal favourite of mine. season 7 however, is not so great... it is very stupid and i hate it, however it is very laughable so i guess it kinda has an upside. season 8 is just plain bad. it makes no sense whatsoever in terms of how the characters end up and features a significant lack of payoff.all in all, don't watch this show, you will only be disappointed.light 6/10"
2020-06-14,mohannedaboshqair-15697,Fantasia masterpiece,10,"whoever has not seen the game of thrones has missed a lot of artistic visual temptation. all elements of success are completed in one artwork, from dialogues, events and optics, all of which makes game of thrones the number one work in the history of tv shows.
big thanks for hbo hat them up."

2020-09-11,slavkotaticc,Love this show,6,"for some strange reason when there is a big hippe over some show i just can't watch it. that's how i have just finished this one and now i understand why everyone loved it, and also i don't get why everybody hate the ending... i actually could expect it.. great show overall. i loved it so much that i didn't have a life for a month till i watched every episode lol"
2020-07-08,sehwag-10279,Perfect fantsy drama series,10,best web i have ever watched i lub this series more than bb as most people say bb is better than got
2020-07-04,emmajay-14792,session 1 to 8 (expect the last episode) is outstanding,10,"one of my favorite shows of all time, a lot of people got disappointed in the last season but for me, as a true got fan i see it fair. i was the only disappointment with the way they ended up the store. i know they say the ending in the book is different which make me and should make you excited to have it and read it. i watched by the time it was broadcast on hbo back then, session by session. but now in this tough timing we all living in and nothing to do in the quarantined, i re,watched the whole series. i enjoyed of course and surprisingly i enjoyed session 8 specifically. episode 3 of session 8 is mind-blowing. season 1 and 6 are the best!
team wolfs forever 🐺"
2020-07-07,pratiklohakare-35564,The Best,10,"the best, i can say just that nothing more now you decide to watch or not."
2020-07-10,sanj-37568,Masterpiece! salute to story and presentation,10,"this is the series which gives you drama, action, love epic war, fantasy, emotions. if you love war films and on top of that killing politics, then this is the show you must watch.the built up of story from season 1 to season 7 was good.
what was disappointing was the season 8(may be the expectations were to high from people). particularity people want to see the death to remember for the most strong and cruel villein cersei lannister.
but overall its fabulous package of everything. all the characters in this show did marvelous job."
2020-09-08,kra-70528,Best! Best! Best!,10,i know so many people say the ending sucks i agree but still the best show ever and we will never watch something better than this

2021-01-11,milorussell-11472,The ultimate disappointment,2,"game of thrones gets a bad rap for having a terrible disappointment but in my eyes the whole show was like that your favourite characters dying or someone not being treated the way they deserved, while yes a better ending would have been nice but after all the journey to it was unforgettable"
2021-03-26,techgamers-75812,Masterpiece.,9,"i don't know how to start but this is the best thing i have ever seen. before watching this i only watched cringe cw shows like flash but one day a friend recommended this show for me. it took me about 1 year to watch a full episode then i told myself i will give it another try and i did and i fell in love. all i did was watch this show. words can't explain how good this show is. it made you think about it all the time, made you speak like them, and even made you imagine living with them. i honestly can't think of a show that did that for me. i am a music guy and the soundtrack at times made me tear up not only from the soundtrack but from the scenes that the soundtrack was played. i will probably never see anything better in my life. from season 1 to 8 i was hooked, always wanted more so i always watched more. the first character i liked was ned stark he was a perfect character to have in season one. his honor and pride makes you like him and how good of a father he was. i'm not hear here to talk about character i'm here to talk about a masterpiece. people hate on season 8 because of writing, to be honest i don't know much about show or movie writing but i actually liked the story. it left you thinking sometimes and imagining how some characters might die or might live. last thing i'll say is i'm grateful that i watched this show before i die."
2020-09-08,geral-99848,Best tv show ever up until Season 7,2,"the first seasons are truly remarkable. up until season 6 this show is near perfection. then season 7 comes and the writing gets much worse, but still bearable. season 8, though, is so bad that not only does it ruin the entire show but it also makes rewatching impossible, since you know how badly it will end. here's a short example: there's only 6 episodes in the final season, screen time is precious, and they show one of the main characters arranging chairs around a table for 5 minutes. no kidding. for me the only explanation for this is a falling out between the show owners d&d and the books author george martin. they probably got angry with him and decided to butcher the show to get even. unfortunately millions of people worldwide were caught and slain as collateral damage."
2020-09-09,mycountrymypower,I am giving 10/10 for seasons from 1 to 7,7,"i started watching this series as i heard about it as ""it is the most viewed series or the best series of all time"".when i was watching ,i also got the same feeling that..no doubt that it is a masterpiece. i fallen in love with every character and i thought that the way will ends. but after watching season 8 my expectations, everything were ruined. ""why they( the makers) ended it like that?""..this is the question that haunted me for few days. the way they want to show dany as a villian is not convincing at all. they forcibly showed that. another thing is that what is use of revealing jon snow as aegon...while watching that particular episode(which tells secret about jon) everyone got goosebumps..and starts imagine him as a future ruler...and at the same time the makers starts leaving small negative impressions of dany...but throughout the seasons she showed like a good person , all she wants is a better world which can be created by her...but the way the makers showed that she felt fear that she can't get the throne as jon is the true heir is a not convincing.....leave about that...she can have fear that she can't get the throne ...but in that situation also many of us thought that later she will be convinced to jon as the king and she as the queen (becoz she loves jon and jon also loves her ) so the makers can create that situation in a clean way...if this also can't happen....they should have to give more time to convince that dany shoul kill the kingslanding people ruthlessly. the way dany killed the redkeep people is not convincing.and at the same time ""everyone wants cersie to be executed by the arya stark in presence of sansa,jon and kingslanding people for what she had done to sansa and her family""..but that thing also didn't happen..instead they ended cersie in a simple unpredictable way. there are many like this. as jon is not the king,dany is not the queen,cersie is not killed by arya in front of sansa...we may not say it is bad one...still it is the best one in anyway..but with a soooooo bad ending...if the ending is in a proper way..it is worth watch for million times ,i can say that surely....but now ,everytime i saw from the beginning..i am thinking that all this will fell into ashes in the end....if possible...in the name of other version of season 8 releases , it will be better...becoz it is not that great ending for a great series of all time..thank u"
2021-02-21,atulyadav-43867,Only if the ending was satisfying,10,masterpiece till season 8 episode 3. i won't say as bad as people say but ending was not satisfying at all. it started hurting me physically to see dany go mad without a reason & the rest of s8 after episode 3 was also very illogical & unsatisfying.

2021-02-10,qmike-13134,Not like this,10,"if you want to end the show like this, it's an ok ending if you gave hints. non of previous episodes build up to this moment.
you can argue that but nah, no enough introductions.
clearly these guys didn't seek second opinion about how to end the show.p.s.
the main beloved character does not die at the end unless somehow in a ""nobel"" way."

2021-05-15,johnsasanis,The best series I have ever seen,9,"game of thrones is an amazing series. it is full of political intrigues, wonderful dialogues and epic battle scenes. the seasons 1,4 are almost flawless. season 5 is not as amazing as the previous ones, but it has some of my favorite episodes, like ""hardhome"" and ""dance of dragons"". season 6 is also an almost perfect season. season 6 includes some of my favorites episodes, like "" the battle of the bastards "", "" the door"" and ""the winds of winter"". season 7 is a very good season, despite having some flaws. finally, season 8 is not as bad as everyone says. i appreciate the amazing cinematography and the wonderful customs. to conclude, season 8 is just good, while the other seasons are very good or almost perfect."
2021-10-06,karudeco,THE BEST TV series EVER comes withe WORST ENDING EVER,10,"they did the impossible: arya should have seen cersei, one last time before she died. this could be the strongest exchange of glances of the serie.the only episode where arya was close to her, was the very first one, this is a disaster. and sansa was away missing everything.the white walkers, was everything in the speechs but nothing in action. 0/20 they were nothing and they did nothing.also the real name of jon snow was useless, and they did not mentionned it in the election.they put bronn the killer in the small concil, but not jon.daenerys, as the mad queen, was a new character, she has spent her entire life to help the poors, and she burnt children...the long night was too short...with no giant spiders.i'm sad and waiting for the books now."
2021-05-20,sarbpreetsingh-03575,Perfect example of how to ruin a great show...,10,why makers why ??? ending is the worst ...this could be greatest show of all time but writers ruined it ...please make again finale episode and do justice with this show ...
2021-03-21,imdb-96466,The last 2 seasons were unbelievable and definitely need a remake,3,"game of thrones deserved all the hype and publicity it got. it did a tremendously good job in creating an intense and believable world. it got almost all the mistakes, that make most modern hollywood movies so bland, right:there were no plain good/ bad characters, everyone had their reasons and the show did an excellent job of explaining them. so for the most part you were also understanding the ""unlikeable"" charactersit was telling several story arcs, so from the beginning there was no main protagonist that you know is going to be the hero of the story and will miraculously survive everything (that unfortunately already changed from season 5 onwards)instead of focusing on the characters it was focusing on telling the story of the world as a whole. i think this is the main point that made the show so exceptional. it was telling a believable story that happens in different areas of the world without paying too much attention on the well,being of individual hero-characters. if the most believable thing to do to progress the story meant getting rid of one (or several) characters, they did....this is.... ....until season 7. season 7 and to an even bigger extend season 8 make and impressively quick switch to ""let's tell a dull superhero story"". suddenly that believable story in that believable world flicks over to becoming a bland action movie.
characters suddenly get a lvl99 plot armor, dialogues (for the most part, not all of course) become an unpleasant mix of cheesy and cringy, teleportation throughout the world has suddenly been unlocked, and characters suddenly start acting against their personalities.it feels like the main intent behind those two seasons was to be done with the show as fast as possible. if that is the case i (and probably many other former fans) probably would have prefered not having an ending at all than this love- und storyless ending that was served."
2021-03-25,vharinandan,The best series I have ever seen,10,game of thrones is the best series i have ever seen despite of having the worst ending. the first 6 seasons are soo good that nothing can be compared 7th season is just ok but 8th season is nothing less than a disaster
2021-04-01,njkingshott,Season 1-5 so good. S6-8 could do without,9,"i'll keep this short. seasons 1,5, incredible story telling. everything is precise, time flows so well in the series. events aren't jumped, they happen naturally. seasons 6-8 it feels like time starts running then sprinting then gone. no real flow, feels rushed and the story that was just told begins to not matter. storylines are left behind, writing is silly and it just feels so broken. utterly disappointed and bewildered at how they finished game of thrones."
2021-05-24,jddirons,what a series ?,10,my one of favorite tv series omg this series is very friendly to watch i watched continuously fabulous.
2021-04-15,kartikcharan,Where's the story????,6,"it's been a journey. the last season was indeed disappointing. i am fine with the choices that were made by most of the characters but simply cannot wrap my head around to how they reached that point. only if the makers had stretched the show for 3,4 more episodes and gave a good arc to atleast their lead protagonists, the show could've been 10 times better. but still giving it a 9 for all the craziness it brought to the screen."
2021-06-17,kaibrigance,Ruined forever.,9,"you want to know how to ruin a show? game of thrones has one of the most interesting worlds in any medium i am yet to witness! great villains, great characters, endless amounts of background and depth. yes it is great! or was great. season 7 set the standard for the rest of the show. and although it would only be one season, it's your finale. no one expected it to be great, but this is just enraging.for the record, though i am still mad about the ending of got, i absolutely do not support the behavior of die hard fans. grow up!with that being said, the ending was just offensive. in fact the entire last season was just a series of unfortunate events unfolding before my eyes. the direction went to a sloppy mess, the story became extremely convoluted, everything leading up to the ending was subpar! rich storytelling went to storytelling with zero explanation. or a shoehorn explanation that makes zero sense. (i think anyone reading this who has seen season 8 will know exactly what i am talking about.)as mad as i am, realistically the majority of got is 10/10 material, but i am so mad that it had to end like some 13 year old fan fiction writer made it.it set up for an exciting ending, and ended with a waste of time.still, watch it if you haven't. it is fantastic leading up to the last 2 seasons."
2021-04-19,jdeutsch-21051,Amazing,10,"ususally hollywood destroys an epic book with nonsense. this show is one of the rare occassions where it didn't screw it up. good acting, amazing storytelling, director is a mad genius. great show!"
2013-06-29,timecow,"Well Cast, Well Acted, Well Done",10,"as many people have mentioned, it is great to see a book to film adaptation that really stays true to the book. the books are so amazing in their depth, and the complexity of the world was unlike anything i had ever read. in a way it was almost like a dramatized version of a true story. the fact that the series has stayed so close to the books is rather surprising since even books with much simpler stories tend to lose a lot going to film. one thing i find very amusing is that most of the negative reviews that i read (and i read quite a few) were written by people who never read the books. it makes me wonder if they would have hated the books, or just hated the series because they didn't know what to expect, and the story doesn't fit the typical fantasy movie/series mold. ( let me add that starting a bad review of a fantasy series saying that you hate fantasy stories makes no sense. if you know you don't like something, don't watch it!) anyway, for a story as complex as this one to be adapted so well as this is a rare thing, and i am very glad to see such a great series of books turn into such a great series on film.i do recommend that if you are totally new to this series you read the books, or at least the first book before watching the series. while it is not absolutely necessary, i think you will get more out of it, and enjoy it much more."

2019-05-12,rfrzen,It could have been....,10,"i know we are so small and cant comprehend time and we always say greatest of all time to everything , it could have been one to go down in cinematography history as one of the greatest. it had all the backstory , talent , funding and passionate people that worked there. like ned stark said everything before the word but is horse ""beep"" , this one has a big but (no pun intended ) .i kept my rating at 10 stars till season 6 ,even tho season 5 had major issues and there were some nonsensical moments here and there but it truly deserved the 10 star rating anyway till that point . it was pretty obvious by this point grrm left the train. conspiracy theories aside ( one was pretty crazy but plausible that disney had a hand in rushing d&d to wrap up got so they can start their new star wars saga , crazy right ) it felt like everything was getting ridiculously rushed to a point where teleportation was something that might be possible . funny meme about teleportation there is a mobile game for got and guess what you have teleportation scrolls , you can literally teleport your house keep around the map .season 6 has some great moments but then slowly but surely the writing goes down hill faster then a dothraki screamer . shock value , hollywood cliches and out of character decisions takes hold and grips by the neck everything we used to love about this show tighter then an dorne viper .season 7 tells us clearly that everything is out of control now and there is hardly a way back to what it once made everything epic , but for all the fans out there there is still quite a lot of hope , at least i had it going into season 8.season 8 is exactly that soul crushing, utter disappointment and disgust towards all the major writing decisions and scripts .i am not ungrateful , without d&d and hbo to start it all this story at least for the time being would have been just an amazing story in a book saga (which for a lot of people is enough) therefor i am truly thankful they started all of this but for what they have done in the last 2 seasons (at least) i will use the last words of stannis baratheon : ""go on do your duty"" ..... and be done with it ...(off screen) ."

2021-08-01,gokulmadhu-37537,The Complete REVIEW of GAME OF THRONES,10,"""when you play the game of thrones you win, or you die. there is no middle ground.""game of thrones is an epic fantasy fiction show adapted from the popular series of fantasy novels, ""a song of ice and fire"" by george r. r. martin.the show focuses on the politics of the seven kingdoms of westeros which are divided by wars and blood feuds to claim the iron throne. the main rivalry is between the starks and the lannisters, with many houses rallying or pretending to rally behind each. meanwhile, great dark magical forces arise from the places beyond the 7 kingdoms.unlike most other shows which have one main character, there is an array of prominent characters like ned stark, arya stark, tyrion lannister, danaerys targaryen, cersie lannister, jon snow and many more but none are neither completely good nor evil and is actually a shade of grey and also none are unsusceptible to death which are the exact manifestations of real life and also makes the show very unpredictable.the show benefitted greatly from its huge budget from hbo and it reflected in its excellent, direction, cinematography and the music by ramin djawadi always gave goosebumps too. the excellent visualization and amazing cgi of dragons and other fictional elements makes viewers wish to be a part of westeros. the show also keeps true to the book, until the 5th season which is great too. each episode is about 60 min long and routinely ends with a jaw,dropping cliffhanger keeping people hooked. also, there are moments of brutal violence and sexuality which might pull viewers who aren't ready for them out of the narrative.it seemed as though each and every actor were born for their respective roles and the 59 emmy wins speaks for itself. peter dinklage who plays tyrion, himself has won 4 emmys for best supporting actor, emilia clarke, lena headey and almost the entire main cast has won many awards too.unfortunately, the show overtook the book series and hence the show-writers, d. b. weiss and david benioff switched to their own narrative which drastically deteriorated the quality of the show. usually shows degrade in quality progressively due to the lack of content, but with game of thrones, it's the opposite. the first 5 books were divided to make up 7 seasons but the content of 2 unreleased books were predicted horribly and condensed into 6 episodes. the story towards the end had horrible writing and the character arcs became polar opposite to what the characters had been until that point and was also filled with plot holes which culminated into a heartbreak and a disservice to the public!even though the last season is a humongous letdown, it's definitely still worth watching. it is political, dramatic, exceptionally suspenseful and carries us through an ocean of emotions across its 8 seasons. almost every moment prior to the last season is pure gold, and will always be cherished by fans too. game of thrones will definitely remain my favourite and as one of the best shows forever."
2021-07-16,greycashmere,Perfect until Season 8,7,"despite the disappointing ending and character arch messed up, this is still the best show of all time."
2021-07-26,sagartamang-71617,For the Sake of GOT,1,"it was engrossing!, hbo at its best and more importantly, george r r martin is meticulous.but without the source material, there really was no one who could take it on and move it forward.the lack of premises were evident after season 6. with no content - the show runners simply had to rush to the end! some ridiculous ends at that.even if this is how grrm means to actually conclude it(esp the fire arc), surely the journey will rationalize it.and thats the good news, folks!we will get there, eventually🤞.and when that happens, hopefully hbo and d&d will be ready for the re-take!for the sake of game of thrones!"
2021-07-21,bapstein,"Near perfect first few seasons, sadly let down by a hurried and disappointing final couple of seasons",1,"when got debuted in 2011, it was a fresh concept, perfectly cast and impeccably acted, and the pacing was near perfect, with a suitable amount of time dedicated to each storyline and the main characters. there could not have been a better adaptation of the books. it manages to sustain this until the end of season 4, and then the pacing speeds up, storylines feel rushed and the show starts to lose what made it a stand out. by seasons 6 and 7, it had lost its way, cutting out key storylines and plot in favour of big budget cgi battles that paved the way for possibly the most disappointing last season in tv history."
2021-07-21,rayjenks,It was perfect until the end,10,"i'm writing this review solely based off of the tv series game of thrones.seasons 1,6 are some of the best television you'll ever watch . you will be taken on a roller coaster of emotions as the plot and character development riptide you in a masterful and clever way. the story will be unpredictable and fascinating. your interest will only grow when the credits start to roll at the end and you hear the ominous score seep through your speakers.season 7 is where this show goes down hill. it is still worth the watch ,knowing that you have already invested and are determined to see it through the end. the character development takes a major nose dive in this season and your interest will slowly turn into confusion.season 8 is a slap in the face .it's like you're on a date with a person and they're really captivating. the date is going extremely well and you start to become invested to the point where you are expecting something magical by the end . when the date ends , you envision a romantic kiss to end the perfect date. instead, you get a painful slap and a goodbye. this season is a perfect example on how writers can ruin a television series. the character development hits rock bottom. you begin to question everything. the end leaves you unsatisfied. on the bright side, the visuals in this season are fantastic and the score is amazing.all in all, game of thrones is one the best shows you'll ever watch. just be aware of the last two seasons ."
2021-08-02,connerbelldirect,"Inconsistent and misguided, but not without merit.",10,"the first four seasons are widely acclaimed to be the best, and for good .the last season alone destroys any chance at a half decent reputation for game of thrones.nobody can seriously justify anything higher than a 6 or 7 out of 10 for such poor and inconsistent writing quality.especially considering the final season and its disastrous finale.there is a reason most people widely hated almost every season after 4 and especially the finale.save yourself the trouble and just watch something that is reasonably good from start to finish with writers that give a damn."
2021-08-25,calvinrpatti,"Seasons 1 - 4: Great, Season 5 + 6: Average, Season 7 + 8: Horrendous",10,that's basically it. season 6 is overrated for sure. the first half of this show is brilliant but takes a dive. season 7 and 8 ruin this show by making what the show built to a dumpster fire. i cannot watch another episode of this show knowing how horrible it ends. thanks d+d!
2021-09-20,rahintjarret,Best webseries ever I watched.,9,i liked all the seasons including season 8 of game of thrones. some people expect season 8 to be predictable happy ending like in movies but season 8 was also well made.

2011-07-27,freddy2961988,Compares to the likes of movies like Gladiator and Robin Hood,9,"based on the bestselling fantasy book series a song of ice and fire by george r.r. martin – often referred to as ""the american tolkien"" – hbo is betting that fans of the lord of the rings will come to this for a sprawling, interwoven tale of feuding families, swords, sex, carnage, beasts, frayed loyalties, deception, intrigue and the pursuit of power. as well they should. game of thrones has all the elements (many described above) that lure viewers to shows like the sopranos, et al. that it's a fantasy series shouldn't scare anyone away, because – like lord of the rings – there's a real allure to costume,dramas that pair dense mythology with all of the crowd-pleasing elements of war, honor, pride, lust, power and, yes, even humor. thrones has all of those in spades and supports them with exceptional storytelling, strong writing, superb acting and some stunning visual effects!!!must watch for everyone!!!"
2020-08-14,guy_sharpe,10/10 until the horrendous final series.,9,"until the last series i would put this as comfortably the best tv show of all time. it had it all, drama, action, suspense, characters who had been cleverly and slowly built up to love/hate. but then that final series dropped and it tarnished the whole legacy. such a shame 8/10"
2011-04-25,mrskablack,Wow!,8,"love this show, love this show, love this show! action, betrayal, strong women, handsome men, realistic costuming, great casting, great story . . . the only thing wrong with this show is the pacing. my husband and i dvr what we want to watch so we can watch at our schedule and half way into the second episode my head is still spinning from the information,overload. i'm beginning to make the connections in and between the families and it is beginning to come together. i know that ""game of thrones"" is book-based - hopefully, they will not stop at the end of this first book of a song of fire and ice series. i have not read these books, but plan to now!"
2019-05-20,helper911,Absolute Disappointment!,10,"**spoilers alert**what a lame season finale, the writers lost it in season 8! totally disappointing!!jon snow deserved to be the king, he was a crow at the end, back to square one after all that suffering...rating changed from 10 to 6!"
2011-04-25,oscarrob,"True to the Book, Excellent, a Must See",9,"i have read the books (the first three i have read twice, the fourth once). i love the books. so in theory i am pre,disposed to either like the series or hate it because it is not sufficiently like the books. it would be damn near impossible for me to judge the series as if i had not read the books. i have only seen the first two episodes of the series.all that said, i love the series. the casting is phenomenal. the acting better than some of the best mini-series. tyrion is spot on (a phenomenal acting job and a phenomenal character). jon snow is spot on. arya stark, cersei lannister, jaime lannister etc, etc. the series clearly gives the feel for the book and is true in its characterizations. no series will have every plot detail of a book nor will it have every character exactly as every individual sees him/her, it can't, but this series is very true to the book, true to martin's writing and true to the character of each player. i can't wait for the next episode. i want to own the series on dvd (blu ray). i want to go back and read the books.this series is a must see in my book."
2011-05-14,wsimmsp,Could be the best show EVER of television,9,"i know i am going to sound like a total fanboy, but what a spectacular job they have done with game of thrones!! the casting is like plucking the imagery, that author martin has so richly set, straight from my brain. normally, with any book adaptations, the expectation of the characters and their core traits, both physically and emotionally, is a rare probability. hbo has absolutely nailed it. the acting is top notch, the set design pinnacle (pause your dvr sometime and notice the intricacies of the various elements within each set), and the script does exquisite justice to martin's imagery. i can only anticipate the growing intricacies of the plot lines to come, and cannot wait to see each character develop as the story unfolds. i have thought for several years that no show could give me the rush of emotion and anxiety as i experienced watching ""band of brothers"", hbo has trumped themselves, and i believe have created the greatest production of a show ever to graced television. i also give the earliest possible prediction that peter dinklage will get nominated for both an emmy and a golden globe for either best actor or best supporting, and he should win one if not both. i urge anyone who has not done so to watch this series, and enjoy getting lost in a tapestry of richly woven threads."
2019-05-15,dxb805,Epic,8,the story in game of thrones is unbelievable the twists is insane after the show ends i will watch the show once more it deserves absolutely 10/10
2019-05-20,dxb805,Epic,1,"best show ever the ending should be better but satisfying, and excepted"
2019-05-20,shspahiu-1,"Good start, mediocre Finish",1,"well the story is based of the grrm song of ice and fire, and, the show until season 6 was amazing but from season 7 to season 8 every episode started to go down hill, that's because d&d instead of book got some scripts. we all got hints for the ending thru all the show, and it was a good ending, but the season 8 was very poorly written."
2017-08-14,bandukda84,You can feel the writers have changed,10,i love this show.however having said this i cant ignore the fact that this show is being rushed. you will definitely see a difference in the pace the initial seasons let the time to tell a story to let ourselves be immersed in the world leading to the haphazard getting to the point kind of writing the show has taken in the current season 7 (however entertaining they take it to be).i am disappointed but don't want anyone to miss out on this fantasy drama. it is a great show.. i just hope they give it enough credit and end it well.
2020-05-17,koolfire,I broke up with it in season 8 and am still mad!,10,"i believed got was guaranteed to be the most iconic tv show of all times! season 1 thru 6 were flawless. seeds of doubt in s7 and s8 turned out to be an absolute freaking diaster. those two egotistical morons ruined this show forever! i'm still so mad that i quit watching my favorites videos on youtube , which i used to all the time before s8!"
2019-05-21,dchas-1,Fairytale ending....Pathetic,1,too many smiles and jokes for such a serious show.
2012-09-29,masta78,Way too overrated! Not any good for a true fan of the books :(,10,"my advice: first read the books and we'll see if you give it more than 4 stars. i don't think so... this is one of the best fantasy saga i've ever read. can't say that about series , sorry. it's shallow and boring with no attention to the details, plain and simple. nudity & gore is not enough to keep mature audience entertained. it's good for teenagers though. if you're true fan of the books - stay out of it! if you haven't read the books yet - do it now and learn the difference. i truly wanted this to be a great series, but it's not. period. saying it's true masterpiece and the best series of all times is just ludicrous and immature, unless you have no expectations at all."
2012-06-04,jtodahyland1,Excellent,10,"this is one of the better shows i've seen in a long time. i'm a huge fan of the book series, and had my doubts about its adaptation to a tv show. but it certainly exceeded my expectations. the casting is great, and the acting is superb, especially for having such a huge cast. michelle fairley is incredible as catelyn stark, but let's not forget about peter dinklage as tyrion or jack gleeson's perfect portrayal of joffrey. heck, i like them all. it's a perfect mix of drama and action, and some of the visuals (especially the wall) are simply stunning. i've just finished season 1 and am so excited to start the second season. winter is coming!!!"
2011-05-10,imraijnus,"After episode four, I'm not watching any more.",6,"as if there weren't enough characters after the first 3 episodes, they add more. i know the series is just staying loyal to book. but the writers just crammed too many events in this episode. it's difficult to follow for anyone who hasn't read the book. what's more, a lot of those events are only back stories which are not shown, only talked about by characters? ""show; don't tell"" is a basic principle of good writing. moreover, in a 50 or so minute espidode, how necessary is 2 minutes of two men talking/reminiscing about a battle where they fought side by side? there are several scenes like this in this episode. the editing is bad, as well. the scene where daenerys kicks viserys' ass (or they have an argument just outside the horse lords' domain) is immediately followed by viserys in bed with a pleasure giver. i found a lot of flaws in this episode that i can't even remember all of them."
2019-05-20,meehanbd,End of series with steady decline in writing. Disappointing.,8,"before this season, i would have given this series a 10/10. for several years many fans gave their loyalty to watching this magnificent tv series only to have been so let down in the final season. every episode of season 8 revealed the inability for these writers to continue to truly deliver the calibre of writing they gave the series to this point in keeping with the books. unfortunately the writers have totally disenchanted fans to the point that they will not invest the time into any other series they put their pen to, especially any sort of spinoff they may contrive from the got series which is sad. i would have followed their work anywhere until this season of got aired which showed that they truly needed a book to follow so that they could simply write a script with the ideas already laid out before them. they have proved without a book, they were lost without any imagination as to how the series should end. the actors, and all other staff working on the series should be commended for producing some of the best tv in history as they did a superb job. truly disappointed in the final season and left feeling like something was missing , yes, in fact there was, george r. r. martin's book to guide them."
2011-05-11,mdmjones,Fantastic,8,"anyone else love the opening credits/theme? the music is perfect, build up is fantastic.the show , all of the characters are very well chosen --- can i say holy crap - this show is good! just watched the 4th episode, all i can say is a very big wow. can't wait for the next - completely blows away any other show running!really is surprising how close to the story the show is staying -- virtually no tv show/movie will ever perfectly replicate the experience of such a well written series as this, but -- this is as close as it gets.i don't watch tv, but i watch this show."
2019-05-09,andrey_mayhem,Almost flawless,8,"put on an amazing story teller (george r. r. martin), great directing, great cast, great cinematography, great music, hundreds of people in dozens of departments and you get one of the most breathtaking emotional, complex stories ever told. with intelligent dialogues, scenes with depth and multiple levels of questioning, plot twists, complex characters, supernatural creatures, many plot lines and a story so relatable in our days, it is hard not be amazed by the tv show's accomplishments.
the only downsides here are 1. regarding the speed of which some plots/character build,ups/side stories develop, probably due to managing decisions or lack of time, and 2, the writing of some episodes/plots/arches. sometimes it feels like the writers were overwhelmed with the complexity of plots and how all stories intertwine that the solutions were just made up on the spot just to simplify everything. in all fairness,
shakespeare, from time to time, came up with some incoherent and illogic solutions as well (see the historical plays or the plays that have several locations in which characters move so quickly from one place to another).
regarding the violence, the sex and the brutality of this show, it is totally motivated. it's not introduced to shock, but rather as a struggle or need. (also, totally motivated for that period of time)
as a conclusion, i am thankful for being a witness at this tv show that, also, made me love and wait for george r. r. martin's books even more."
2019-05-20,bett-x,farewell Go(a)T,10,"first of all is my first review in imdb , i cant accept how people can change vote from 10 to 1 ( from hero to zero ) got doesn't deserve that, even the s7 & s8 and rushed and lazy written still is the greatest of all time. just remember s1,s7 . farewell go(a)t"
2019-05-23,sarahhh1,Great beginning which created a foundation unrelated to a rushed series of plot points thrown at a loyal audience.,10,"unparalleled excellence by actors and crew; they did the best they could, given the severe drop,off of quality from the writers."
2019-04-19,jcg3247,Absolutely. Phenomenal.,10,"the greatest show i have ever seen. i watched it as it was coming out episode by episode but wasn't able to watch season 6. before the premiere of season 8, i went thru and rewatched the show in its entirety. some times as many as a whole season in a day. the show has all the elements that make for a great show. humor, devastating sadness, edge of your seat excitement and a great, gripping storyline. i laughed, i cried thug tears, i stood up and clapped and i sat back and grinned with pride. i grew to love (almost) all the characters in one way or another. peter dinklage, kit harington and emilia clark were amazing and played their roles to perfection. there will never be another show like game of thrones. i wish i had more hands so i can give this show 4 thumbs up. i highly recommend this show to anyone who likes tv. you don't have to be someone who likes fantasy, i'm not."

thanks for the waste."
2012-07-05,anon_a_mouse,"Sex, betrayal, violence...And where's the payoff?",9,"i doubt even the author of the books knows. he's still slated to finish the final two books of this saga in the near(?) future. there's no doubt they have a huge budget with all the great talent that's on the show, but sadly, they lack the proper writing to match. the plot is spread too thin, the dialog is uninspired and at times hard to watch. if the dramatic speeches sound familiar to you, it's probably because you've heard it before. my biggest problem is the lack of character development. they're all so full of irrationality and contradictions, it makes their motives contrived and their actions hard to justify. it's all so childish."
2012-03-09,jakeangry1,Game of Thrones - Looking forward to more.,10,"i cringed when i heard that game of thrones was being made into a series. initial thoughts were that things would be grossly out of place and simply not nearly as well told. then i heard that the series' author was on hand to ensure that the writing for the show would be consistent (not exactly the same but consistent) with how the characters were written.this concept created one of the most amazing tv shows out there. of course having hbo's budget sure helps create the most amazing sets and wardrobe imaginable helped out substantially.this being said , game of thrones is not simply an adaptation of the novels. i tell people that the tv series is a visual companion to the novels; which are so big that you almost need the tv series to help your mind see all of the pieces moving. from the wall, to the horse lords, to the eyrie, to well you name it - the scenes are breathtaking. but for as amazing as it all is none of it is as good as the cast. i tip my hat to the casting directors - they had one heck of a job putting this crew together. every cast member fits so perfectly into the shoe that is their character. my novel favorite is tyrion lannister - played by peter dynklage - is just as i imagined reading him. special kudos to the entire cast however as they are as ruthless/loving/amazing as the characters they portray.however i will say that there are differences in the show from the novel. this is to be expected. some of the major differences include: raising the ages of the children (some are married/in adult situations - this is a good thing as the novels never really ""held back""), cutting scenes short, providing information sooner, situations not in the novel, and some name changes. game of thrones has so much history, developments, events, and characters that this must be done. but it happens with much care. in a particular tv scene, the queen and king are sitting together talking about events that brought them together. this scene (if i recall correctly) is for the show - to sort of wrap some information for the watcher, but it's done so well that i doubt anyone can complain. the series certainly keeps the tempo moving, the characters lively, and the audience engaged in the events. the show could have scripted word for word many events, but i think the brevity they have shown in season 1 works very well into their favor.unlike most written works to screen, game of thrones does a great job capturing and bringing to life possibly one of the greatest modern fantasy stories ever written. i hope you enjoy this show as much as i have."
2019-05-20,olaparmros,Does not deserve a perfect 10 anymore,1,i have always had this rated as a perfect 10. after this final season it is obvious that the show does not deserve that kind of rating. i want to encourage everyone that feels the same to please lower your rating. it is still overall a good show but it is not a perfect 10 anymore.
2019-05-21,anna_jyre,"Thank you for an AMAZING show! Hats off to HBO, David Benioff & D. B. Weiss! And a big THANK YOU to all the actors which made all the characters so real and lifelike.",7,"please forgive my (sometimes bad) english, my native language is swedish and i am not planning to use a translator.i first want to specify that i haven't read a song of ice and fire and at the time being, i am not planning to, at least not jet, not until george r. r. martin have finished his book series.of what i've read about the books and heard from friends that have read the published books is that they are far more complex, detailed and complicated, far more than a movie or tv,series can ever be. therefore i admire hbo and david benioff & d. b. weiss courage and bravery of even thinking of making a song of ice and fire into a tv-series. hats off to you all!george r. r. martin (a screenwriter himself) have been building ""his world or universe"" westeros & essos since the 1990s in his head. creating places, religions and people living in that world. and plenty of it!! more than it's physically possible to add to a movie or a tv-series, therefore george r. r. martin have (perhaps more than once) declined selling the rights to a movie adaptation.but george r. r. martin did agree to a deal with hbo, and i am sure or at least i hope he had the intention of finishing his book ovel series before all the seasons of the tv-series were over, this he did not succeed, at least not finishing the book series before the tv-series now ended. there are still two more books to be published, two more books with characters, intrigues and solutions to problems the readers haven't been introduced to jet.therefore again, i admire hbo's courage of making a tv-series that (at that point) were mostly/or a huge part of, in one man's head.even if george r. r. martin has been a part of the creative process of making the series, (how much i do not know or dare to guess) a lot of details have been in his head after season 5, that is as far as the books takes the readers.if we'll ever know, what destinies george r. r. martin had planned for his characters that is completely up to george r. r. martin himself. the power is still in his hands. if he finishes his books.i read an article about george r. r. martin some time ago, were he spoke of his own type of writing. that he sees himself as a gardener, he plans seeds that he waters and let evolve.that article explains a whole lot, i would say. that statement also tells me, that george r. r. martin haven't known the story until the story revealed itself for him, fragments by fragment. the ""garden grew"" (as the number of characters, gods and places) as the story evolved. this must be a very exciting and intriguing way of creating. but somewhat confusing and complicated, i would think, for those who taken on the task of making this into a tv-series.how did hbo dare to take on such project of making a song of ice and fire into a tv-series when i author himself did not know there the story were going to end up???i must say, i really can't understand, as a screenwriter george r. r. martin himself, knowing how complex, detailed and complicated his story and storytelling was and is, how could he ever sell the creative licence and creative use of such story? and give someone else that kind of power, because since his story wasn't finished, he did give that power, that right, to someone else, to hbo.this i admire and almost can not understand! from both perspectives. with this said, again, without of had read the books, i think that s8e6 was a perfect ending, of what hbo were given. okey, i can agree with others, that season 8 felt a bit rushed, but not as bad as others want to suggest or state. i am not sure if it's true or just a rumour, that hbo originality had 9 seasons planned but changed their mind, making and rewriting the script into those 6 episodes we've now seen. if so, that explains a lot why everything needed to proceed quickly. if so, i guess they had their reasons. of what i do not know or dare to speculate.a well made ending, that in one way, was one of few endings that makes sense, as ""simple as it might feel"". beautiful in it's simplicity. as bran stark said to theon ""everything you did brought you where you are now."" and as true as his words to theon was, so was also this ending. everything that the series have built up to, is this. we've actually been given hints of this ending all along if you watch the series again, you'll see it and it makes sense.i did not write a song of ice and fire or the script to any of the episodes in game of thrones,
i can only refer to me, myself and my own life. but if i do, i conclude this:
perhaps there are other solutions to the problems in our own lives, than the ones we see ourselves, maybe there are better ways to live our lives than what we have done until now, but who we are now, are a product of the choices we've made along the way. good or bad, the choices we make or the decision we take, form, make and create us and our lives. (regardless if we want it or not) we are the result of the choices we have made. so is this story.who am i to judge someone else's story? as well, as who are you, to judge someone else's story or life, when i or you haven't lived it? it all comes down to preferences and choice. it doesn't matter how amazing someone say a specific beer is, if i don't like beer, i will never enjoy it. beer is not something i will never learn to love. it's about preference and choice, nothing else.okey, i see that people take this series and especially this season, very personal, that this was not the ending they or i foresaw or had wished for, but it all led to this.
i must admit after last episode i wasn't sure what to expect, but i did see daenerys transformation coming weather i liked it or not.daenerys was not born as the person she became, even if was her father's daughter, she was formed of the life ""she lived"" (we're still taking about a fictional character here, living in a made up world, even if some people on the internet seem to know her more personal than that) therefore she became a person who could burn down the capital to get, what she her whole life thought, she wanted or had the birthright to claim. we've followed her since she was a sweet innocent girl, seeing her evolve into a leader, a warrior queen and finally a tyrant.the entire series has been about a game/a war, a game of thrones.
there will always be heroes, enemies and casualties in wars. someone's hero will be someone else's enemy, that is the facts of war. and in wars there will never be a completely happy ending, there will always be losses on both sides. weather we like it or not, weather we are on the loosing or winning camp, there will be losses. game of thrones led us here.i think tyrion summed it up quite well in his dialogue with jon snow. i say no more of that.if george r. r. martin would have finished his a song of ice and fire earlier, if the creators could have read the last chapter before they made the last season, maybe or perhaps we've would seen a different ending. but as long as that or those final chapter/chapters are still in one man's, in george r. r. martin's head, the creators (hbo, benioff & weiss) have their creative rights to do what they mean is the best way to solve ""the problem"" of who is going to rule over the 7 or now 6 kingdoms.everything hbo built up to, led to this, nothing more, nothing less. again, as bran stark said ""everything you did brought you where you are now.....""hbo, david benioff & d. b. weiss have been judged very hard based on this season. a bit too hard i would say.
only if george r. r. martin would made his series completely on his own, then it could have been made differently and completely accordingly with his own mind and thoughts if he, himself have had the means to use millions and millions to build up his world anything close to what hbo really have accomplished.i thank you george r. r. martin, for giving hbo the chance of life trying to recreate your world, your universe, (you didn't give them an easy nut to crack, did you? ). so please finish the books, so we all can read how you might have solved it (perhaps differently). perhaps, even i will read it, you see, i don't like to read books that has no ending. i like to read all the chapters, because every story deserves an ending. please george r. r. martin please sit down and finish a song of ice and fire series.i say thank you to all the actors which made all the characters so much alive and lifelike (that it has created a storm surrounding the entire game of thrones series) you've all done an amazing job!! all of you, regardless how small or great role you've played. you've been amazing. thank you!!thank you hbo for an intriguing series! wow, what an accomplishment, intriguing story, amazing casting of actors and showing us beautiful filming locations and surroundings.last but not least, thank you david benioff & d. b. weiss for an honorable ending. showing us that even a place like the seven kingdoms, (where previously family and blood ment more than who you are as a person), could become a place of democracy or as close to that a medieval time would allow. showing or reminding us, there is still hope, and it's not to late to make a change (sometimes with sacrifices). thank you for that!i wish david benioff & d. b. weiss from the depth of my heart, all the best of luck in the future. i hope and wish that disney will take good care of you, giving you the creative freedom and means to continue creating amazing things, bringing new stories to life.and thank you to you, whom read this far."
2016-05-18,randall-c-melton,Game of Thrones Season 6,10,"this happens to be the best written, produced, and filmed series to ever come to television. now that there is no book to follow, the producers have gained the same vision as george rr martin, the author of the fire and ice game of thrones books. each episode has been full of epic story lines, all having an effect on the ultimate story. viewers are treated with a cinematic masterpiece each and every week. each story,line is full of unique characters who keep your attention throughout each episode. however, the series is not for the weak hearted. each episode is full of adult language, nudity, and over the top violence. however, what brings people back is the writing. hbo and the production has truly spent a great deal of time producing the most visually striking series of this century."
2019-05-07,dreemteam24,No connection to the books.,7,"first i've not read the books and i wont read a fantasy book that fatter than my encyclopedia. sure sean bean did hold my interest enough so i bothered to even look the source material and keep watching, but that was it. after they killed his character the show started missing enough charismatic actors to keep it interesting. you had charles dance, again killed in spectacularly idiotic fashion. and we are left with cast's outcasts, who do passable job if the plot is good, sadly it isn't. and that is this tv show's problem it's quality has been dropping and has finally tanked, simple as that. now maybe that it got too hyped, it continued too long, but while i wasn't looking forward to seasons 2,3 at least they were interesting and kept me watching, this last season(8) and later season from 4 i feel like sitting back and watching married with children would be more entertaining and edge of the seat exciting."
2011-08-25,nenvolk,Soft-core porn in a Fantasy World,8,"don't get me wrong, it's a high production value, high level of acting and casting but it doesn't change the fact that it's all about people having sex while talking about something interesting happening elsewhere, off camera, in the past or in the future. if you want to know what season 1 is about you can watch the first three scenes and the last scene of season one, and you wouldn't really miss anything. it's sex and the city in a fantasy world... really... truly... but u get to watch ppl wearing swords and having sex with your girlfriend! iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit is soooooooooo boooooooooooooooorrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiing!! if you have watched more then one movie or read one book in your life there really aren't any surprises or new things to this. it's an hbo show, just placed in a fantasy setting this time (lame imo)"

2016-05-12,alcmrall,Possibly the best show ever made,10,"the series is now on the 6th season. this is the first time the readers are at a loss at what will happen next as the book series ended at about the same point as the hbo 5th season left everyone. this is the first time that hbo is coming up with all of their material as original work with some help from george r.r. martin, himself. so this is the really the first time we actually see the creators of the hbo show stand alone in creativity with nothing to really go off of... and they are doing an amazing job! i think fans were skeptical at the split. many figured that the successful books were part of the reason the show was so good, but this season is easily proving all of that wrong. the twists and turns so far are exhilarating and seem to kind of follow the fans' inspired theories. (no spoilers!) the acting is still incredible and watching the series is like stepping into a whole other world. hbo did a great job in its casting and the scenery is always gorgeous. i am personally looking forward to everything having to do with bran. but all of the characters and their own sets of drama are what keeps me watching religiously every sunday at 8:00pm."

2011-06-06,andrew-982-470423,Cheapened with Porn and F-words,10,"i love fantasy stories, but recently the only stuff to come out of hollywood is full of porno and swearing. really find that it cheapens the movie. sad thing is that those scenes and the language are not even needed to make it a great story. this is my main point, these things are not needed, so why put them in? i mean what value do those scenes add? the f,word also feels like a modern word which should be left out of medieval stories. perfect example of a great fantasy story is lord of the rings. had none of that and it is one of the greatest movie's ever. it is a shame it looked like the story has so much potential was really into it until enough got enough."
2019-05-23,rita-3-497037,Great show right until the end. 10/10,6,"some thoughts after having watched the finale:i absolutely loved every minute of it, the finale in particular!i think that all the whiners who are complaining about how the show ended just haven't been paying attention to what has been happening for the last decade, while they have been following the show. i suspect most of those were too busy playing with their phones while watching it, so they missed details that hinted at what was going to go down in the end.while i agree that daenery's arc was rushed, the clues that she would turn mad were there from the beginning. however, it could have been fleshed out a bit more during the final season (or by fleshing it out a bit more in the previous seasons). i can see why it surprised so many, including varys, jon, tyron etc. everyone was surprised. by not guiding the viewer well enough through her ascend to madness the creators did, after my opinion, make a great disservice to the characters of deny and also grey worm, whom we have grown love and rooted for, and that is a pity.i was hugely disappointed that tormund giantsbane and brienne of tarth didn't hook up, i was totally shipping those two!!i was surprised to see that jamie ran back to cersei and did not kill her as was prophesied (and which i quite frankly expected). it makes not sense to introduce a prophecy in the show only to drop it in the end. not to mention that his road to redemption kinda felt moot. but ok, i guess that there's some 'sweetness' to it too: they came to the world together and they left it together, but stil... moot.while i understand the 'need' to punish jon after killing daenerys, i don't understand why the black watch is still there to begin with. what is left for them watch? the night king and the army of the dead was defeated, the wildlings have become allies.... what is left for them to guard, really? seems a bit pointless. though it was lovely to see jon & ghost reunited!those are my thoughts for now."
2019-05-20,nancy_samanov,Do not waste your time with this.,10,"the story started great. loyal to the books (1,5). but (a enormous but) the final season is an insult, not only for the story (that grrm has not finished) but to the spectators, tv entertainment and also to the characters itself. don't see it. is not worth the time. if you don't believe me, just read the final seasons comments.breaking bad is still the best serie ever."
2011-05-01,sushanrox,LOTR of the small screen,9,"firstly i would urge those of you who haven't read the book to do so. the series is a dark and violent fantasy epic for the ages. the characters are mostly human( though the book does mention a few other sentient species). unlike the wildly extravagant magical creatures in lotr, the main theme here is intrigue and political power struggle in the continent of westeros. the power rests with the royal houses of arryn, stark, baratheon, lannister, tully, targaryen and others who are all embroiled in this war. the action is sporadic and understated and more is implied than said.the author of the book series george rr martin is also closely involved with the production of the show and thus has kept it close to his books. the special effects are decent and the narrative is brilliant. i personally believe this show will do more justice to it's parent books than the lotr trilogy since there is no time limitation in a tv show and all the events can be covered well."
2011-04-19,pacatlanticprjh,LOVED IT! A Series steeped in Passion,1,"i watched an encore last night and i was so enthralled with the grit and texture of the piece, so much, that i was emotionally and mentally whisked away into a fantasy world of passion. passion of love, death, power and life. my lover and i watched it several times in a row last night, until we were totally and absolutely filled with satisfaction. it brought back all the great memories of epic films such as ""braveheart,"" & ""lawrence of arabia,"" that we adored growing up.we felt the acting was spot,on! the men were men...and the women...well, shall i dare say delicious! the costumers surpassed our expectations by again being accurate to the times and yet revealing a subtle teasing of the beautiful women's forms (lena & emilia)...and the locations were breath-taking. there aren't many films...and definitely no american tv shows that even come close to being as exciting to us, as this one. lena is possibly the most lushish woman we've ever seen.being a history nut, i was thrilled with the successful attempt at depicting the brutality of the medieval era, including the sexual scenes. traditionally, the women were mounted from behind by their lovers, which is accurate to that era...and it was exciting.my lover and i took full advantage of the fantasy and ravaged each other after-wards. thank you for producing such an exciting and emotionally thought provoking tv series.please...give us more! especially lena."
2019-04-17,fendiluvsus,For the Ones Who Can Actually Think,10,"fans of game of thrones, please despise me. as probably belonging to the 1% of the population in this whole world that find this show incredibly overrated, shallow and poorly,written, i cannot get my head around how awful the writing and the directing are. i have given the show three tries; oh, how i wanted to be addicted to this hyped dose of ""drug"". i just couldn't go on and finish it.it's not about the sex scenes and the violence; plenty of shows and movies containing sex and violence stood out righteously and laudably. but this show, oh my god, comes with wonderful costumes and grandly orchestrated opening theme song (i will give you that), yet picturing a world that is too big for the writers and director(s) to handle well. the plot is contrived for the sake of ""shocking"" audience with abrupt deaths and unrelatable characters. i felt desensitized by the superficial violence, felt completely indifferent toward any characters because of the laziness of the writing which seems to instantly divert once the character has the chance to be dug more deeply.many characters seem to be manipulated for ""big finishes"" -- suddenly being killed. but then what? nothing really happens to enrich the main plot. and what the hell is the actual main plot? several families fighting for a throne? i will tell you what, watch an asian drama that unravels the backstories of the forbidden city, for instance; masterpieces that depict clever schemes, greed for the throne and the hardships to obtain it, complex emotions, intriguing characters and cultural references, as well as fascinating sub-plots and main plots.drowning in a massive sewage dump is how i feel about watching the show game of thrones."
2011-05-24,lordy_lord_lord_of_lords,"Will this be another show HBO gets me hooked, before unceromoniously dumping it for inexplicable reasons?",9,"lord of the rings it ain't... and i mean that most definitely as a compliment to game of thrones. don't get me wrong, i liked lord of the rings, but the 'seven kingdoms' of game of thrones is a spectacularly unpleasant place to live, as any show set in what is essentially the middle ages should be. if you find subject matter such as extreme violence, bad language, rape, incest and just generally very unpleasant behaviour unpalatable, maybe give it a miss. it's an hbo 12th century thing with, so far, mild supernatural elements. two and a half men it is not.sean bean plays eddard stark, the main character and puts in a solid performance, for the moment, never sure how long anyone is going to live in this show. i was always quite fond of the guy, this is by far his beast work to date. also a shout out to peter dinklage, who has the somewhat depressing honour (for all other ""dwarfs"") of being the first ""dwarf"" to receive a decent roll in a film that doesn't mock him. quite the opposite in fact, he plays an intelligent, womanizing, cunning and witty person who so far is, in my opinion, the most likable, and it has absolutely nothing to do with 'aww he's a ""dwarf"" and he's just like us', nah, he's an incredible actor that plays his role with utter class and completely convincingly, and after two episodes was able to make me forget about the brainwashing that hollywood has inflicted on most people about, and i don't even know what is the politically correct way to say it, so ""dwarfs"". i apologize to peter dinklage if i got that wrong.there are a considerable number of important characters in got and at times it can get a little confusing, but you have to stick with it, it's worth it, and you definitely have to watch it from the beginning. if i missed an episode i'd be totally lost.the investment in everything from costumes to cgi has in no way been short changed, hbo pulled out all the stops on this one, which, i hope, means they're not going to just drop it (at least without giving it some kind of ending, as they didn't with oz for example).this is my first review, i'm aware it might not be great, but if you have a thick skin and can handle unpleasant content, then this show is definitely worth watching, but again, start from the beginning and watch as intended, don't try to ""cheat"", you'll only cheat yourself.this and the walking dead are the best tv shows currently on tv, but this, so far in my opinion, still has the crown.9/10"

2011-04-18,unknownmirc,Lord of the Rings - I think not!,10,"seeing a review comparing this brilliant title to lord of the rings made me make an account here and post my very first review. i had very high expectations from this series and i believed that it will (like most tv series) absolutely ruin the book. and i couldn't have been more wrong! where do i start...the cast is great, though not amazing with one exception , sean bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the north, eddard stark. the setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. now to get to the part most people are interested in: what is this? what can i expect of the series?this is not lord of the rings. now that i got that out, i can continue. the very idea behind the series is a lot different. it's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. and there are many secrets, you will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. if you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! it's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will beg for next episode just to see what happens.what to expect? plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... all that after the first episode. i really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress. conclusion: do not miss this! yes you complaining that the book is better. and everyone else."

2011-04-19,paulday98,One of the most stunning shows on television,7,"do not believe any of those negative reviews. i honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. i think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.having said that, this show is stunning. i have never read the books and now i want to. there is so much crap on tv that is renewed year after year (csi, house etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.there is enough brain,dead television. but once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. game of thrones is one such show.it is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. it is worth watching just for the scenery alone.yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.the scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by sean bean perfectly cast as lord edard. although sean bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and lord and soldier. he is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.after watching and sometimes enjoying camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""merlin"" by comparison. and where camelot lacks in depth and scripting, game of thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
2011-07-20,complicatedlysimple,"Unpredictable, thus, Compelling",8,"i decided to watch this series, in its first season, back,to-back, because of its respectable status here on imdb. simply put, you wont be disappointed. at first, it might remind you of lord of the rings because of the genre, but the world of game of thrones is much more realistic, gritty, and unforgiving. it has magic, but the real magic is the dynamic relationships between the characters and the events that occur. it has great writing, and the pacing of the series when seen continuously is perfect. by the end of the series you'll be familiar with all of the families, kingdoms, and history of the realm. the acting is superb; the characters you like, you love, and the characters you don't like, you hate. the worst thing about this series is that it ends right when you want it to continue the most! i actually had to read the wikis on the books because i wanted to know what happened to the characters. season two should be even better and hopefully they will continue the series for sevens seasons, or however long it needs to be to cover all of the books.this tv series/book series is epic storytelling. and its only season 1/book 1.little advice: don't fast forward through the intro. it helps teach you the land of westeros!watch it!"

2011-05-09,slomopro,Cliffs notes on film,6,"i have read the books and looked forward to the series. george rr martin was a recommendation of a friend of mine along with a woman named hobb. hobb had to wait due to the immediacy of my addiction. i was somewhat let down in the first episode. now i can say nothing more than: so far, it is merely watchable. the books sucked me in and held me due to the amount of detail and immersion in the storyline. the characters came to life, leaving you wanting more and more. this series lacks the character development needed to achieve the same effect. i hold hope that once the cast are at war and the starks and cohorts are on the move, things will pick up, but i grow more and more skeptical. the imp is spot on, though. i think if they played the book out a bit more on film, they would have an epic."
2012-03-31,adgarlach,Excellent Adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire,10,"being a huge fan of the books and a chronic cynic; i had many concerns when i heard they were making the series; how would they bring these books to film and do them justice. my largest concern was the difficult task the actors were handed. the books are written from the pov's of numerous characters; each chapter having a designated character. so you are inside the head of a character for all the events in the books. you learn the character's traits and motivations through his or her thoughts. this obviously cannot be done on film, so it comes down to the actors to portray what these characters are going through without the audience being able to hear their thoughts. i cannot name a single actor that fails at this. this cast is exceptional. some notable shout outs go to the young members of the cast who are so essential to the story. cudos to jack gleeson, sophie turner, maisie williams, and isaac hempstead wright for pulling off joffrey, sansa, arya, and bran so successfully. another shout out to jason momoa for khal drogo. when your character speaks a language created for the show; it becomes even more difficult to portray that character. mr momoa does it so successfully you want to stop reading the subtitles and watch him perform.another thing i was concerned about was the scope of the world and giving an accurate portrayal on film. there are so many descriptive locations in the books that needed to be shown to tell the stories. the locations were amazing. most impressive to me were the wall and the eyrie; both whose features are not only difficult to portray; but vital to the story. the sky prison was just as i pictured.my only critique is how difficult it is to take large book with a large cast and portray all the important details within the stories. i watched the series with my wife (who has not read the books) and at least once an episode had to explain some things that got glossed over. but over all an amazing vision of an amazing series of books. a must see."
2011-05-18,maydr-57-188885,Unbelievably fabulous,10,what a thrill! i was so excited to find out that hbo actually had placed all the episodes on hbo on demand.i've seen most of the episodes and so far so hot! the landscape in the show is gloriously beautiful.the actors are all so interesting. i don't recognize any of the actors but they are all perfect for the roles they play.i like the midget actor. he could quite possibly be the best actor on their show.i enjoyed the jousting scenes. it is a television series that i hope will be around for a long time.
2011-05-26,ideal-radiance,Epic.,10,"so i had heard of this new series and was interested to see how it was. within the first 10 minutes, i had to text friends to see who else had watched this. its crazy good. ever watch a movie and when its over you feel pumped up? this does that. for sure.it has everything an hbo series is expected to have. violence, nudity, language, and an awesome story line. i ended up watching the first 6 episodes the first night, staying up until around 5am.this is not the usual mid,evil show/movie with kings and queens and fluff. this is action packed, a twisted story line, its fantastic.try to not blink"
2012-05-24,melvyn-jones1,A little disappointing.,2,"before i continue let me just say , i do enjoy game of thrones ! however, having absolutely loved series 1 i find the second series a little disappointing. my mistake was to read the second novel before the series started to air and i find that i am missing some of the characters who i think add to the plot. where are meera and jojen for example? haven't read the third book yet but i can only assume that they may have a pivotal part to play in brans life! a lot of the characters stories seem to have been changed (jon snow, particularly(his screen time doesn't seem to be any shorter but almost completely altered - where is the incident with ghost for example?))presumably to fit in to the series schedule but it does detract a little for me.also - where is the action? - battles are totally glossed over. one moment you see grey wind lunging at a soldier next moment thousands of bodies lie dead on the battlefield. individual conflicts are over in a flash (brienne's escape from renly's tent for example).don't get me wrong i love all the intrigue but i do feel its lacking some excitement. dispense with the nudity and titillation and stick in some good old scraps. wars aren't (just) won in the bedroom.despite all this i will continue to watch but it leaves me in a bit of a quandary - do i read the third book when the series has finished (as was my intention) or do i not spoil the 3rd series? oh decisions, decisions !!!!"

(Points to the chasm he pushed his opponent into) He did!""",9,"when we think of fantasy novels, classic myths, and epic stories in general, a consistent theme in all them is that basic, easy,to-identify good is fighting against basic, easy-to-identify evil. think of beowulf fighting grendel and his mother, or frodo trying to destroy the one ring, or odysseus trying to get back to greece. the heroes are instantly obvious because they are all handsome, smart, and wielding some sort of blessed weapon against their ugly, brutish and stupid opponents. game of thrones completely throws away these preconceptions and creates a world where there are plenty of easy to identify villains but a terrible shortage of easy to identify heroes. the series takes place in a middle- earthish world where seasons last for years; the summers are times of plentiful food, sunshine, and peace, but the winters are brutal, nasty, and infested with armies of creatures called ""white walkers"" that consume everything in their reach. fortunately, they sleep in the far north behind a great wall of ice during the summer. the series takes place during a nine year summer that is about to end; white walkers are said to have been spotted rising from their slumber, but the wall is maintained by bands of poorly supplied soldiers that are either too old or too incompetent to fight them off. the human kingdoms to the south aren't prepared either, for enormous amounts of court intrigue and corruption constantly threatens to explode into civil war. as if all this weren't enough, the descendants of a mad line of kings overthrown decades earlier have settled into a wild land across the sea, and are building an army of ravenous horsemen to retake their throne...if you don't want your innocence ruined, don't watch this series. but if you want a bloody, seductive, and much more realistic version of the fantasy genre, the game of thrones was hand made for you."
2019-04-30,nightmare-cm,Incredible show,5,"this show is easily 1 of the best ever on television, do yourself a favor and just watch it"
2019-05-13,chicusmc05,Stunning masterpiece,8,incredible episode!! this was one was a masterpiece! movies don't even come close to this level!
2021-06-03,mdcoplan,"Started strong, ended poorlg",9,it doesn't matter how good the previous seasons were if the ending is terrible.
2019-05-25,deepucool-107-142231,Either they didn't have the budget or they have worst writers,1,"they tried to cramp in too much information into season 8 and it didn't work out well. all the character building of various key characters from season 1 upto now is of no use. many plot holes and unexplained prophecies. we don't know what happened to that faceless man, all the hype for the next one to take the throne. what's up with jon snows past? why even mention and lead a hype for nothing.poor writers and a bad finale."
2011-08-16,richardliu7896,"Absolutely fantastic...from an ""outsider's"" perspective",10,"just so you know where i'm coming from, i've never heard of ""game of thrones""(not the board game, books, etc) until the show was released. in fact, the only time i heard it even mentioned was when my friends discussed the previous night's tv shows. prior to watching the show, the only thing i knew about it was that it was fantasy. i should also mention that i hate fantasy books and movies.however, ""game of thrones"" totally blew me away. even for hbo's standards, this show is just epic. i rate this show an firm 10/10.a little about the show: the show takes place in an alternate world that is so meticulously set out that one would think that it's real. each house's history is so complex, the characters so realistically dimensional that i'm not sure i was watching a documentary or a fictional show. this, however, is not a series about fighting and bloodshed. this show is all politics and relationships between people, classes, and races.what i like about the show: hbo really outdid itself with ""game of thrones."" $5 million dollars per episode...and every penny worth its price. the physical settings could not have been more realistic. castles and deserts, city streets and tundra, every backdrop was absolutely convincing, and this only serves to underline one of the shows greatest strengths: the depth of the ""game of thrones"" universe. i also must mention the strength of the acting of the whole cast, not just peter dinklage (who was particularly brilliant). i'd even say that each actor was born to play their got character (not really, but you get my point). again, i have to commend hbo, this time for selecting an effective cast. i would not be surprised if several of these actors go on to become premier tv stars, if not a,list movie actors.so now, after watching one season of this show, i am a total song of fire and ice junkie and i have gotten my whole family hooked on this show as well. do i recommend this tv show? well, only if you are not scared of being blinded at the brilliance of this show."
2014-11-04,marcusjohansson91,If you haven't watched it go watch it.,10,it's always the same every season in got. it happens very little the first 7 episodes and the last 3 is just insane and the viewers love it. there are so many reviews out there about this so i'm not sure what to add. but what i can add is that got really steps up the game for making series. it's so well made and rich in every aspect. i have longed for a really good fantasy series to follow and got is the one series that has been able to fill that gap.the atmosphere is really good and the acting is flawless. the story captivates you and the love and hate for characters makes you almost like a part of the series itself.we do not sow.
2019-05-12,zachcaston,Genuinely the best show ever made,10,"this show is amazing, 100% must watch for anyone who enjoys great television."
2019-05-20,sven-falkenburger,Not the GOAT in tv shows after seeing all 8 seasons,10,"after seeing the show failed in writing within the last season it is official now: got is not among the best tv shows of all time. so i downgraded my rating to 9/10. this title still belongs to series like the sopranos, breaking bad, the wire or mad men.what do these 4 shows have in common got has not? brilliant, constant writing!"
2019-08-25,lynxenn,Don't watch the final season.,10,"i thoroughly enjoyed season 1,7, but the final season just ruined the entire show for me.after using imdb for over decade, i finally made an account just so i could express my disappointment at the final season of game of thrones.i think the actors did a great job with what they had to work with (which wasn't much) and the episodes were visually stunning. there were a few fan service moments i enjoyed over the season, but i still felt they went overboard with the number of those scenes. that's pretty much all the positive i can say.like most other people, my issue is not with the what happened, but how it was written. important moments being glossed over or not shown, but they still managed to squeeze in plenty of filler. i was also disappointed that the episodes all seemed pretty short after being hyped up for being ""movie length"".i think that one of the most frustrating things about season eight is listening to celebrities, including the cast, defend the writing. most of them try to claim people are just upset because they are unhappy with the plot and it's not the ending they wanted. or that people wouldn't be happy with any ending. funny, most complaints i see are about how it was written, many even saying they liked the story-line but it was executed incompetently and rushed. i wholeheartedly appreciate the hard work the actors and the crew (well, everyone but d&d) put in to the final season... but to defend it by saying the fans are just upset and it is disrespectful for us to be unhappy with a poorly written final season, makes me lose a lot of respect for them. yes, they worked hard on the show and despite being unhappy with the writing, many fans still thanked them for their hard work. the actors need to at least respect the opinion of the fans since if it wasn't for us the show wouldn't have anyone watching it. there wouldn't be a season eight to disappoint us. if a majority of your fans are all expressing the same opinion, you should at least listen to them and validate it. not dismiss it because you disagree.did some fans like the final season? yes. but the facts are, the final season is the lowest rated season in the history of the show for a reason. the most commonly used word to describe the final season is probably ""disappointing"". but hey, at least it made the finale of dexter seems not to bad. lookie there, i found another positive."
2018-12-18,anshul-152-924087,The Best I have seen so far,6,there is nothing less than perfect 10 to rate this series. its epic in all the ways. it has everything to keep you engrossed on the screen hours after hours.
2018-08-15,sharewithjackie,A must watch for every human being!,6,surprized that my search for a good movie ended here!i will talk about this series until my last breath!
2019-05-23,aaronongtw,8 years for this,10,maybe just watch it up to season 6 then think of how you'd like the series to end. would be more enjoyable if they didn't do such a terrible job ending the series.
2019-08-23,theamazingandy,"""The ending doesn't matter, it is the journey that's important,"" proven WRONG.",5,"yes, you can completely ruin a show with a terrible ending, and that is what got will be forever remembered for: the worst final season of all time. an ending so bad, it ruins the rewatchability of the show. let me start off by saying, i was as big of a fan of the show and the books as you could possibly be. i finished the books in 2012, and since have reread most of them. i have watched season 1,6 more times than i even feel comfortable admitting. i wanted to pour my disappointment into a beautifully written polemic, but instead, i am going to put as much effort into the rest of this review as benioff and weiss did into the final season:stupid story, arcs ruined, plots abandoned, rush rush rush, every character takes stupid pills, okay let's wrap this up already, fight fight, cgi, okay we're done. screw you nerds, let's go get that sweet star wars and netflix money.btw, i find it odd people are still doing ""spoiler alerts"" three months after a series has ended. here is a spoiler alert for you, season 8 spoils the entire series."
2019-05-20,nilufarsigari,Trash,1,season 8 was the worst ending so disappointing.trash trash trash
2012-08-12,maralarkin,"Fantastic, a much see series.",10,"though i recommend a strong and mature mind to follow the story line, the series is fantastic. from blood to deceit to sex, to whispered secrets and false allies, to secretive passageways and clever plot lines; the series is a grand masterpiece. the characters themselves make the stories just marvellous. there's so many, yet none are the same. some are good, some are strong, some are honest, some are clever, and some are stupid. their actions can make you cringe or scream out in delight, or you find yourself cheering on some and hating others, just like any other good tv series. the actions that are taken, and how events evolve into something more, is just so cleverly done, by both the author and the creator of the tv series. (would that be the author too?)and though the story takes place in a medieval time period, with fantasy creatures and knights with swords, the language is not all that difficult to understand.the only con to this series is that there are so many characters. though i know each and every one, maybe read the books before so you have an idea of who every one is. i know some people sometimes mix other characters up, and the story moves quickly, so you must pay attention to every episode.either way, to any one who loves blood sex and drama, this series is right up in your alley.for me, i can't imagine this story/series getting any better. and the actors are fantastic, they make the story so much more real. they really stick true to the book."
2012-04-11,raylward-222-28118,I Would Not Typically Watch A Show Like This and I Love It,10,"it took a lot of convincing for me to give got a shot. halfway through the 1st episode i was motivated enough to spend an hour on the internet trying to understand the universe of westeros and the relationships between the main characters. if you have not read the books then a little study can add significantly to your enjoyment of got. although i enjoyed lord of the rings, i would not consider myself either a buff of fantasy or of the dark/middle ages. kings and castles tend to make me move on to something else. but, for me, got has turned out to be my favorite show currently on tv. the 1st is breaking bad. so if you think you may not like this program despite it's high ratings please give it a try. i hope this show gains a broad audience and can survive at least as long as breaking bad or the sopranos. one last thing , got shows that hints of the fantastic and supernatural can be as powerful as the bazzilions of fantastical creatures that inhabited middle earth of lotr."
2019-05-01,juliahopper08,My absolute favorite show!,9,this show is fantastic! all of the characters and the actors/actresses that play them are incredible.
2019-05-20,nasim-binesh,"Amazing show, seasons 1 to 7",1,"this is the very first review i'm writing on imdb. i first encountered got back in 2011, and watched a few episodes but didn't catch,up. this year when i heard the final season is coming i started watching the show, and i was smitten by it's writing, characters, stories, costumes, pretty much everything! the characters were so believable, they were not black or white. they did right and wrong. one episode you hated cercei for being cruel, and the next season you wanted her to seek revenge from high sparrow. one could easily get lost in this fantasy world. up until season 8! when everything became a chaos. writing was awful, stories didn't make sense, and people's motivation was unrealistic. i'm not saying that dany going crazy was unrealistic, on the contrary i always felt like she was so cruel. what bothered me was the inconsistency in writing material. it just didn't make sense! i guess writers were so much focused on coming up with plot twists that in the end they chose the most unrealistic ending just for the sake of shock element! i mean bran becoming the king was so unconvincing. and jon going to night's watch?! probably the fact that books are not finished had an impact on the quality of writing; writers didn't have material to refer to. one could easily see this; many dialogues were repeating what we have already heard on earlier seasons, and characters backstories flop. all in all, got is one of the biggest shows on tv history, i would love to rewatch episodes from seasons 1 to 7. but the final season was a failure."
2019-08-16,crazypianoman123,Good show,9,good show i even liked the last season. it has a lot of twist and drama. plenty of action. it's very very long so lots of content to binge watch.

2013-06-16,ttaskinen,Greatest TV series of all time,10,"and that says a lot. after watching the first two seasons my opinion about this show was somewhere between very great and absolutely amazing. it was totally mesmerizing watch with dozens of memorable scenes, but i was still puzzled whether game of thrones is on the same level as some of my other favorites like breaking bad and the wire. after season three, i can only say that game of thrones blows every other series i have ever seen out of the water.after the first season i had to pick up the asoiaf books and blasted through them in one summer. having seen the first season and how well the book translated to the screen, i was extremely excited yet slightly nervous to see the rest of the story come alive on game of thrones. nervous because the first season already was so well made, i was afraid if the show can keep up with the standard it had set. not only did it do that, but it just kept getting better! the casting is perfect, the acting is amazing and i simply can't praise this series enough. the story george r.r. martin wrote keeps you on the edge for every moment of it, and the changes they made for the game of thrones have so far been only for the better. it definitely deserves all the hype. i'm feeling awkward writing a review that turns out into a praise, but i simply can't find anything bad to say about it. if there ever were some little mistakes i didn't like, the rest of the awesomeness made me forgot about it as if it never happened. there were few scenes on season three that alone would've made me give this series 10/10. only thing i can complain about is having to wait a year for the next season. and a year more after that.i don't think tv series could get any better than this. except maybe the fourth season."
2012-01-23,mdfbianchi,A 10 for Balance,10,"(minor spoilers ahead. nothing plot,ruining, i promise.) i don't feel like i could begin this review without first mentioning some of the other reviews i've read on here. considering it currently carries a 9.4, you don't need me to tell you this is a great show worth watching. but there is something that disturbs me. just about every 1-star review i read rates it 1-star specifically because ""there's too much sex!"" (there's another reason that comes in a distant, but related, second which i will get to in a moment) really? you pathetic busybodies who have never created anything have the audacity to denigrate another person's work because it's too sexual? this is the problem with america-we live in a society full of people so enamored with their hatred of sexuality (and it has to be noted, homosexuality in particular) that they will go out of their way to drag down anything that doesn't appeal to their prudish sensibilities. we're a land of knuckle-draggers and philistines so immature we cannot separate sexually explicit from pornographic.this is a story about intense lusts and passions---the lust for power, lust for revenge, lust for companionship and sex and all manner of things. it's frank and explicit and to eliminate the sexuality is to eliminate all the power of the story. i will be fair and say it may be uncomfortable for some, but those ""uncomfortable"" moments will comprise hardly 5 minutes of your total viewing time every episode, and if you cannot take 5 minutes of discomfort to enjoy one of the best epics in modern literature (and now television) you're more than free to return to hackneyed, deplorable safe-bets like c.s. lewis.secondly, there is a sizable minority of posters who say the show is sexist. a common complaint it's sexist because it reduces women to sex objects with all of the female nudity---which is the worst sort of vapid, can't-see-the-forrest-for-the-trees ""feminism"". and ignores the several instances of male nudity, including a very explicit (but tastefully done) love scene between two men in the mid-season. but this show also contains some of the strongest female characters on television. yes, one of the main antagonists is a woman (i cannot say much more without spoiling it) but she is a shrewd, intelligent and well-developed character who is defined by more than deceitfulness.i've wasted too many words in response, so allow me to summarize: this is a brilliant show with an enormous cast and plot full of intrigue. though the dramatis personae begins large and expands, it is well-trained on just enough main characters to allow us to connect and bond with the stars of the cast.peter dinklage's turn as the king's dwarf brother-in-law tyrion lannister won both the emmy and the golden globe, and not without merit. he is easily the most compelling character on the program. my only complaint is that tyrion seems to be the only character not entirely reproduced faithfully from the books. (although sansa stark does undergo some minor personality changes to compensate for a couple of the minor characters from the book who were not included in the television series.) tyrion's intellectual side is covered in much greater detail in the books, whereas the series somewhat reduces him to a drunken lecher with some intellectual tendencies. i understand it makes for compelling television, but it does sadden me somewhat. i am hoping with the set up for the second season, we will see more of tyrion from the novels.particularly bold, in both the movies and the books, is that no matter how central a character is to the plot, it is no guarantee they will survive. could you imagine of lord of the rings had killed frodo halfway through the two towers? infeasible as it may seem, if george r.r. martin had written lord of the rings, it would be a definite possibility. there is a sense of danger in this world that epic fantasy tends to lack, and everything is better for it. while you may find yourself missing a certain character, a new one will undoubtedly find itself a place in your heart.just don't get too attached.overall: 9 out of 10."
2012-02-22,rusiriw,A masterpiece that take you to dark ages and really leave you there for you to sort the way out..,10,i have never watched a movie or a tv series that let you live among characters at the level this series does. excellent except being too short and fast moving at times. i don't think the book is very special but the film making is. i give credit to the film director and the crew. i wish they make more tv series like this one. i remember people kept the ratings at 7.5 until the 5 th episode and suddenly lot of fans are born. i was giving this 10 stars from the day 1. the story builds enough tension for you to be very fearful. at the same time some joy. but mostly keep you on the edge. there is few magic around here but mostly this is close to reality. it was a pleasure to experience this saga.
2014-08-10,drimma,must watch for anyone who likes any of it's genres,10,"as the summary says, this show is pretty much one of a kind, and anyone who hasn't seen it yet and likes good shows in general should watch a few episodes at least to give it a try at the very least(it simply hooks you in in the first few episodes ). i won't divulge the story or give away spoilers, because i wouldn't won't anyone to spoil it for me as the story simply is so well crafted, that you just want more once you start watching it. to give some of my own input why i really loved it, let me say that it doesn't take the classical route of pretty much 90% of tv series ever made having a main character around whom the whole story evolves (and you know they are immortal or immune to the bad stuff that can happen and should happen in any series in order to give it that drama factor that makes a series draggable for more then a season or 2 to make it worthwhile watching and not bore you to death up until the moment you stop watching it...yeah it happened to me with ""fringe""), but instead it shows you this magnificent non hollywood world, environment/storyline where anything can happen...and it does!...and this is something that kept me and still does to this series and can't wait to see the next season (if you are wondering about how much i watched, just compare the review date with the series release...i am always up to date watching it :-) )"
2019-04-10,coolkitty911,No words,10,"game of thrones! is single handedly the greatest show i've ever seen! the plot, characters and the gripping story line. there is a lot of episodes and we were very weary of starting as there are so many but once you start you just simply cannot stop, it took us a month of one after the other. excellent show!!"
2012-02-29,andrewmoores79-305-880114,Television does not get better than this,9,"game of thrones is, quite simply, one of the best series i have ever watched.right up there with the x files, battlestar, west wing, 24, i just love it.well acted, brilliantly written, sets that wouldn't look out of place in a movie blockbuster and story lines and characters to die for.every episode is like a mini movie, as series one goes on it just gets better and better. cleverly they have avoided any huge battle scenes , i presume they are coming in series 2.amazing shocks along the way and one of the best final shots to a series ever, everything is perfectly poised for an epic season 2.can't wait!"
2019-06-09,nieyaaz,Not the best ending,1,"the ending of game of thrones was quite a disappointment and it really does not make much sense as per the previous seasons. one example of this is , bran as king. sior they attacking the gates. bran: don't do anything they are exactly where they suppose to be and so are we. just too many loopholes to count."
2012-03-11,vitocavallo,"This series is phenomenal, addictiive and naughty",4,"just about everything in this series is phenomenal. it is geared for adults so the nudity, violence and gore might offend viewers. some gory scenes could have been left out. my wife is not into scifi, but she loves the renaissance aspect of the series.the plot is great and you may have to watch a couple of times to get it sorted out. casting is phenomenal. the actors play their part well. tyrion is intelligent and witty. the villains are evil, heros are commendable, and the inept and insane are just that.a lot on the naughty side, i enjoy the ""all natural"" women. i was actually surprised at the amount of flesh is shown, but sex sells.we await season 2 and hope it is as good as the first."
2019-06-17,wagnerlinda,"Amazing, but not until the end",9,"game of thrones is no doubt the best thing out there. i was invested in the story of incredible characters for many years and the writing of the show ha always been accurate and well paced, believable and exciting for 6 seasons. season 7 lost its plot when they turned gendry into a marathon runner beyond the wall and season 8 was a total disappointment after episode 3. the actors did a fantastic job always and the cinematography is outstanding but i have to agree with many fans: the writing was sloppy and inconsistent, this show deserved better."

2015-04-13,bradbender,Fantastic show but......,8,"i love this show i just cannot believe how many man on man naked, gay make out scenes there have been? just surprised they have gone as in depth with intimate homosexuality as they did. i've overlooked it 5 or 6 times thus far, then guess what... right out of the box, episode 1, 2015 season, another extended man on man scene. outside of that, the plot is genius and intriguing. there are so many different story lines, that you never really get bored with any of them. i've been on the edge of my seat, jaw dropped, in shock all at the same time. i've had many characters that i've despised and hoped they would kill off as well as characters that i've loved and were killed right away. point is this story line has an extremely hard twist that i don't expect anyone could ever guess ""what happens next"". this would have been one of the easiest 10 stars for me if they could have just dialed down the homosexuality. as it is i'm trying to decide if i want to continue watching."
2012-06-24,micbar-387-904297,I'm just saying...,10,"please note this may contain spoilers of other shows such as breaking bad, not game of thrones though, other shows are in here because its a comparisin. i watched the first episode and i think it's not so good, i mean whats up with all the nudity unneeded and all?it is good i admit, but its not better than breaking bad, especially for being thought out, i didn't read the books and watched it, it starts out foreignly, i shouldn't have to read the books in order to know whats going on. like walking dead, i know whats happening from the start. here are reasons why breaking bad is much better than this... 1. based on creativity, its not based on a book 2. reaity, its the only show where it shows the characters choose their fate. 3. backstory, it has flashbacks that are enough of a back story, not an entire episode's time like lost. 4. danger, they switch enemies ever so often, each time getting more and more powerful and dangerous, yet while walt struggles to keep his spot in the king lineup and focuses to get there himself, with every takeout/move he makes getting more dangerous and powerful himself. the only movies good with one enemy through the series are harry potter, the walking dead (which has more than one zombie), the mummy (remake, first two), and batman (the joker's returning) 5. it really happens, things like this, can happen, unlike medieval time that... 6. it has a point, you feel things, pain, regrets (and there not coming from buying the seasons) but you feel what the character feels, it makes you feel like your right there with them in the fight. like 3d but its not... 7. acting, bryan cranston was amazing even in malcom, no one could be that good, aaron paul is a perfect junkie, matt jones plays badger perfectly. anna gunn and rj mitte, there all perfect, enough said there... 8. they end the show before it gets out of hand, its gonna end in sixteen episodes, sixteen heart,racing downfall episodes that lead to mist, with one question... what happened to walt? what is going to happen to him? i bet if this show would have eighteen books thud make twenty-two seasons, put two books in one season, simple as that, before they get out of hand, more realistic. now the walking dead, i also think is better but i thought breaking bad would make a good example."
2014-02-24,bsheehannukka,Perfection,9,"what can i say about this series? less is more i think in this situation. this is a literary masterpiece brought to life on the screen. george rr martin's novels are some of my favorite books that i have ever read. and this is the cinematic experience of those books brought to life. the scenery and sets are gorgeous. the story itself is a thrill ride that will take you from peak to peak. the characters are deep, complicated, and lovable all in their own ways. except for that bastard joffrey... if you haven't watched it yet, please just do so. nothing i can say here can convince you more than an hour with the series will. just do yourself a favor, and watch this."
2020-01-25,pxkiani,A fantasy for the ages,4,"this show was groundbreaking. i followed it from the first season. the performances, cinematography, costumes, set designs, and visual affects are world class. the story will shock you and you may not always like the outcome. however, as a whole this series stands out as a truly remarkable decade in television."

2020-06-04,numbskull01,"George R R Martin shows he is the backbone to the GoT DNA, by letting the show self-implode",7,"over a year on and i still cannot get over the injustice that season 8 delivered us.seasons 1,6- they were perfect. a fine mix of necessary action scenes and patient character development. lures the viewer in with suspenseful scenes despite a slow moving timelineseason 7- a fine season but something feels a bit off...something is building...it doesn't feel rightseason 8- what have you done? why have you don't this? why have you ruined the game thrones series. why have you made every main character invulnerable. the whole reason we loved it is because anyone can die at any moment. we liked the patient approach to getting to know the characters. you rushed, hurried, ruined and destroyed what could have been the best show to grace television.well done george, you have shown you are pivotal to this show working.
yes i know it's just a tv show, but all the same, i'm carrying the chip on my shoulder still.
also bran is clearly the worst character, why make him the king ????"
2019-05-20,hassambitw,And Now Our Watch Has Ended - An Overall Review after All Seasons,7,"there's probably nothing that can be said today that hasn't been said about game of thrones that should be news. everything that you have heard about the show , from the wonderful visual effects, to the set design, the cinematography, the beautiful score to the acting - holds true till the very end. in that regard, this show (as of the writing of this review) is the benchmark and it'll be hard to get toppled over. the talented directors and writers over this 8 year period gave us a fantasy epic which has become a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon that will forever remain a huge part of many people's lives, and for that i am grateful.the final season has just wrapped up, and unfortunately the show's legacy is now going to be two-fold. there was a time when people clamored to find out how game of thrones was going to conclude, a time where people were anxious because a show of this magnitude ending would leave a void in people's hearts that would be hard for any show to fill, a time where it seemed like this show was going to legitimize itself as *the* greatest show of all time. however, due to the nature of its conclusion, that is no longer the case. game of thrones is going to be remembered as quite possibly the greatest show with the greatest crashing of an ending.the biggest issue of the series is going to come down to poor writing, poor pacing, and lack of episodes as it approached its final seasons. season 7 and 8 represent mixed bags of goodies. you can tell what the goal of each big moment was and as a fan and i was all down for it. i'm not going to spoil what these moments were because i'd like new comers to not get deterred away from the massive onslaught by fans right now, but the thing to take away from this is that there's a significant dip in character arcs and there are choices that are made that just don't work because there was not enough time to execute them properly. i'm sure in the minds of the writers, they made sense because they have probably had in-depth discussions with each other about where each character is going to end up, but translating that to screen with fewer episodes where everything seems so overwhelmingly rushed skips the integral moments that help let the audience come along this journey. the pace at which the last two seasons have progressed contains frankly enough content to make at least 20 episodes, rather than just hastily putting it all in 13. we've received a conclusion that falls flat because it wasn't properly built up and earned. it's an ending which, while may represent the actual book ending, does not work for the direction the show was leading into.all in all, i love game of thrones. it's still going to be up there regarded as one of the best series ever for good reason. it's just extremely disappointing and disheartening to witness the route it took towards the end which made it seem like the writers wanted to end the show as soon as possible (whether it be to work on other projects, or they simply did not really know how to expand it). it's going to leave the fanbase divided, but i hope over time people focus more on the good we got rather than the bad - because this show still deserves it."
2014-12-16,moviedude22345,"Excellent, if you've followed it from the beginning, you know it's worth the 40 hours or so.",10,"first, i'm not saying anything about the storyline, because if i even give a hint about one episode, it'll ruin the whole seasons experience, and no one would like that, because the show is just excellent.game of thrones. the most brilliant, hard to watch, raw and brutal show ever to be released on television. i don't get into tv shows that much, but from the time i even heard the name ""game of thrones"", i knew it'd be amazing, because hbo just does an amazing job with shows.this show doesn't hold anything back, sex and violence play a huge part in this masterpiece. the sheer, unflinching brutality of this show brought back a feeling which i only had when i watched wolf creek for the first time!if you enjoyed the books, the show is even better. people say that breaking bad would have to be the best show on tv, well they musn't have watched game of thrones, because all elements that one would look for in a show is here. violence, a deep storyline and much more!speaking of which, time to re,watch season 1!"
2020-12-21,fatmackymacc,The Best TV series ever.,10,"my review is in the title. everything about this show is flawless, the writing, casting, pacing, special effects, fight scenes, twists, turns and even guest appearances all excellent. launched the careers of many of the main cast. better than the books, by a mile."
2015-04-02,goblincleaver24,The best show on television. Hands down.,10,"what can i say? there is no other show like game of thrones. it is simply the best.where do i start? well, i would like to first point out that of all the tv shows out there, very few of them i watch and even fewer are the ones that i legitimately love. it is not like the majority of other shows are bad or terribly made, it is simply the fact that with so many tv shows out there, patterns become evident, story lines become uncreative and repetitive and once you've seen enough shows, other ones become predictable. a handful, such as 24, psych, vikings, black sails and of course, game of thrones, truly pique my interest. with that said, game of thrones is stunning in basically every aspect. wonderfully adapted from george r. r. martin's incredible novels, game of thrones brings to life the world of westeros (and essos). i am a huge fan of the books as well and i can say that the show stays very faithful to the books. of course, slight changes are made, but this has to happen on occasion, and i have rather enjoyed most of the changes. things i love about the show: the plot line. this is the cornerstone of game of thrones and a song of ice and fire. the plot line is what makes the show so amazing and intriguing. it is a masterfully written story about kings and queens, lord and ladies, knights and warriors, children and adults, love and betrayal, politics and war and good and evil. the characters take it to a whole other level. the characters are so diverse yet so realistic. i'm sure each one of us can find one character we can relate to or at least sympathize with. characters are loved while others are hated and furthermore, others remain neutral, fooling even the most dedicated audience to what they might do next (looking at you petyr baelish). apart from the books, the show is able to bring all the visual aspects forward in stunning display. namely the filming locations and costume designs. croatia, ireland, morocco and iceland provide for most of the scenery and man if it isn't beautiful. it is authentic and rugged and provides the perfect opportunity for bringing the world of ice and fire to life. the acting is incredible and performed by an amazing cast. peter dinklage, jack gleeson, lena headey, charles dance, kit harington, sean bean and iain glen are among the best. finally, the action scenes are wonderfully done. realistic and gritty yet still intense and a joy to watch. who doesn't like big battles and epic scenes of single combat fights? now, if there is one thing that i do not like about the show, it is the sexual content udity. while i admit some of it is necessary, i think it is a little over the top. i know this is hbo and hbo specifically caters to adults, but extended brothel scenes with nudity for the sake of nudity? not exactly a fan of that. it certainly takes away from the bigger and more important events going on elsewhere in westeros. despite my dislike for the unnecessary nudity, the show as a whole has my rating of a 9.5! but since that is not an option, i'll have to give it a 10. i will always love this show and i cannot wait for the upcoming seasons! remember, winter is coming.favorite characters: jon snow, tyrion lannister, ned stark and ser jorah mormont (close behind them is arya, varys, jaime and samwell). favorite episode(s): watchers on the wall and rains of castamere. the children is another amazing one.keep up the good work grrm, david benioff and d.b. weiss!"
2012-08-18,jarieus,A truly exhilarating cinematic experience,4,"game of thrones is one of the best tv shows ever made.it is in the leauge of breaking bad which is also incredible. what makes it such a good show is the vastness of it. its a huge setting, huge cast and huge plot with so many twists and turns. the acting is amazing and you start to relate to certain characters on a personal level. the graphic violence and explicit sex just add to the perfection of the show.short review but please start to watch game of thrones because you will not be disappointed. forget big brother and csi, this is the real thing! 10/10. also you may wish to read the books before hand but its not imperitive. the books are quite breath taking though."
2018-10-11,mandeepsagoo007,THE BEST SHOW EVER,10,best quality+best acting + best writing + best show ever in the history of cinema
2012-11-02,snh108,2nd season was disappointing,1,"season one of game of thrones was easily the best fantasy tv series i have ever watched. the acting, the visuals, the costumes were all extraordinary, and while there were departures from george r.r. martin's source material, even these departures seem to me to have served the larger sweep and purposes of the epic. i give it a 10.but what happened in season two? everything was great except the story falls apart again and again. (spoilers!) the most blatant plotting error is arguably the burning of winterfell. who burned it, and why? the iron men were on their way out the door to accept peace terms. we're given no hint that roose bolton's bastard son is anything other than a loyal northman. i was totally confused (and a bit shocked) until i read the book.other head,scratchers: how does stannis baratheon make it from the walls of the red keep back to dragonstone? what made sansa decide not to leave with sandor clegane? she seems in the series quite ready to go.the plot changes aren't all bad. for instance i found the transformation of danaerys' stay in qarth compelling and well-fitted to the larger story. but compared to season one, the writing in two is inferior and made the show hard to watch at times. please, hbo, allow this series enough screen time to breath...and have a talk with your writers!"
2019-05-11,adame1124,"Aside from the show itself, THE MUSIC",8,"can we give ramin djawadi a handful of emmy's and a dozen future jobs in epic movies for his absolutely constantly stunning and beautiful scores for all 8 seasons? the quality in the story of the show has dropped so much in the last two seasons, but the music has only gotten better over 8 seasons. his quality, vision, and matching the epic visual scenes and moments of the show.... it's amazing."

2013-04-08,sawtimberinc,"Great Show, BUT",9,"guess i am really getting old, i get lost in the characters. one old king looks like another and when all bundled up in furs the young ones look alike, how about some kind of insignia on their armor or a different color for them, it is hard to follow. the idea is great! did not like ned stark losing his head ! is the young prince going to walk again? that arrogant young king does not deserve the new sexy princess, think he is gay anyway ! is the actor that is playing the leader of the snow army the same one that played julius ceaser in a previous series? all in all its a good show, just a little hard for us old folks to follow."
2021-01-01,vikas-bihani86,"The best show ever made, but....",10,"without doubt this has to be most creative and unique show made in history. would have loved if show ended after season 6 or 7.but writers thought otherwise and made disastrous season 8 and ruined the entire build up of characters of earlier seasons.if you have not watched this series yet, watch only till season 7 and then imagine your own ending.valar morghulis!"
2012-11-12,connor-white,Best TV series EVER.,10,"this is the only thing i watch on tv, it's simply amazing.after hearing people talk about it for a while and having no idea what it was, i finally gave in and looked it up. it sounded interesting so i watched the first episode... and then the next 2 series over the next 4 days because i was so immersed in the storyline.eddard stark (sean bean) performed flawlessly in the first season and i actually felt sad when he died while being angry/frustrated at joffrey (jack gleeson).then there's jon snow (kit harington) he's probably taken the spot as my favourite actor because he is just that good! and i am eagerly awaiting to see what he does in season 3.since watching i have told 2 friends about game of thrones and both have thanked me, so if you have a interest in fantasy films/tv shows you should certainly watch this, you wont regret it!"
2019-07-11,beyond-infinite05,Realistic Fantasy Soap Opera Low on Realism and Fantasy,6,"when a powerful production value combines with highly popular script of books (or at least is based on it), and further enhances it with some great star,cast, thats supposed to be recipe for success. and from what i have seen, game of thrones did achieve some amazing success.however, the series while pretending to rely too much on realism and avoiding allegorical romances of epic fantasy, is more of a sham. peel away the outer layers of imagined cunning of the plot, and you have something so rudimentary and devoid of substance, that it turns out to be no better than reality show tantrum. of course, there are few stronger points here and there, but they never develop enough to arc into more meaningful story arcs.yes, in reality, people are grey shaded- they have motives driving them onto middle paths more often than not. but most main characters in the got series seemingly fluctuate from pure evil to pure good in skips/hops. and that might cause viewers to often be confused about whom to root for. so formula that worked here is not necessarily taking fantasy out of realistic characters but simply make them live in crescendos and crescents. series developers may have wanted viewers to believe such transitions happened over the time- but that is another failure to which i will come back later. daenerys' character is one primary shinning example- girl with empathy in heart just turns evil. her character was so confused and literally begging to be done justice with in last season. but as i said, its just one example. and then of course, there is the case of pure evil and pure good characters. those are just in sorry state - either overdone, or underdone, ending up looking inapt with confusion. the balance is missing with one exception of certain sean bean/eddard stark.acting is great through out the series barring that of one or two characters. most of the actors managed to incite the right emotions. and that might be only winner in this whole fiasco.the plot- where do i even start. martin's books have been shameless rip-off of history and other authors's works with his own dark twists to them. got show being based on those books is none too different. if that is not necessarily a bad thing, then supposed novelty of the ideas is such a thin mask on underlying layers of supplicate from greater works that it is almost cringe-worthy to think how world gave it both thumbs up (well, most of the world). a potpourri of ideas where none has been baked to its full potential, thrown in with some deus-ex-machina, tossed with vague magic based sub-plots. for a series that takes pride in being firmly anchoring the fantasy genre, it for sure makes a big mess of its mythical elements; which is highly perplexing. not that i like my tv shows or books spoon feeding the details- but far from it. however, when you deliver a fantasy soap opera going at great length to dumb down information on every who's who, leaving out certain aspects that actually should have made this a ""low fantasy realism"", seems more incompetence than anything else.there is great shame about failure of directors to deliver an impact of passing timeline in the show; could have learned a thing or two on that front from peter jackson. the other low point for the series- the supposed shock value was a dud too. anyone with little keen mind should have been able to see the supposed twists to be coming from quite afar. there was genuinely no original surprise beyond season one.it isn't that got doesn't have redeeming quality, but its average at best, and may somehow sound insulting to writers of high fantasy. nonetheless, it may stay popular with viewers forever, for they may take the show for what it is- a popcorn flick, and not the high art."

2019-06-14,leam-555-322576,Such a disappointing ending,4,"i originally had this amazing series 10/10 but downgraded it to 6/10 purely on season 8.up until season 8 it was gripping with the great war looming and the throne contenders lining up. all seemed to be going great until the end of episode 3. the night king meets his demise and sets the final episodes up for the last war. what did it bring us? bewilderment!rhaegal the dragon taken down by one scorpion arrow yet drogon flies through an entire fleet and fortress equipped with an arsenal of scorpions.two of the main characters cersie and jamie flattened by rubble, what a let down to see these two beneath bricks when they have been arguably two of the best characters in the entire show.no cersie sansa face off which everyone was expecting and a prophecy that tells john he is the rightful king which leads to him taking the life of danerys only to end his character back where he started being a nothing north of the wall while bran, who's done virtually nothing for 8 seasons, given the crown!???how could they possibly have got this so so wrong?"
2019-01-15,egyptianprince89,UNWORDLY,9,this show is the best thing i have ever seen in my entire life. i watched the entire 7 seasons in less than a week. my life literally stopped for a week and my only wish is to wipe my memory clean and live through that week once again.
2019-05-13,michielmds,What good is a review if only unrealistic figures are given,6,"in a review you give a grade to indicate the quality of a film or series. here you take as many points as possible, such as the way it was filmed, the acting performance, the story and the special effects. if something is disappointing ,then you give a lower point and if you found it very good then you give a high point. a 1 and a 10 are almost never given ... except for game of thrones.what good is a review if only unrealistic figures are given.this season could have been a bit longer and there are more continuity errors than we are used to, but it is still amazing how the writers, actors etc. have managed to make all this possible. this episode was just really good and it was no surprise that the crazy queen would come to the surface. also a good end to some beloved (and less beloved) characters. certainly a big 9 for me"
2013-07-08,dattatreya-n7,A Game that never ends / gets to the point,10,"for those new to this thing, the only reason game of thrones the book series got so much undeserved attention is because it went in the opposite direction of the fantasy genre's rules. instead of a classic good vs evil take it went for the everybody's in the grey area. the problems started right there, cos for most people fantasy is the genre where you want classic good vs evil battles and you can sometimes show the honourable side of a villain, doesn't mean they get as equally good moral compasses as the heroes. thats what the drama genre is for. the second thing thats wrong with the books is that they simply have no sense of direction, like when the first harry potter book was being written by j.k rowling, she knew how the story was going to pan out. she knew it would be a seven book series and had a bird's eye view of the future works. game of thrones simply is an improv sketch, where george martin made the story up as it went along. some of the stories just makes no sense , its like watching the life of an ordinary guy, nothing happening, story not leading to anything , any event. even though hbo has thrown in some big budget sets, vfx and good actors, this ultimate sense of futility will definitely start getting to you from season two/three. remember all the fun times we had hating mindless gore/sadistic movies and calling everyone that watched them sick. well hurray, this show just managed to convert everyone to the other side. now you can just cut the head of lead and noble characters, and call it unimaginable plot twist. killing the hero is not a plot twist, ending of sixth sense was a plot twist. any idiot can create a sense of shock by suddenly killing of the most important characters in the show. i don't know if any of you have seen the hot tub time machine, but in it there's a scene where john cusack's character asks the kid why he's wasting his time in a game(second life) just being in prison taking push ups. i mean this is the place where you get to do the impossible stuff, so why not go kill some orcs or terrorists and be a hero? game of thrones is ruining the fantasy genre like that. this is an escapist genre, where you don't have to be reminded of the grim, boring nature of our lives, a genre where heroes are born, epic battles are conducted, where there is always light at the end of darkness, hope that makes you want to live. in short, if you like your tv shows to make no sense, no purpose, and you re happy to just watch fictional characters living out their lives, talking matters of no importance to each other, cutting heads, raping, molesting, where the hero always dies, you ll find it sufferable."
2012-12-30,jandgbristol,Looking forward to watching more episodes,10,"i have only recently come across this series and was surprised to hear it was based on a book. i myself am a lord of the rings lover and i am very into my fantasy films. to make a book into a tv series has been done but not usually to great success, however out of the two episodes which i have watched i think that it is a great triumph and core,graphed very well. the actors and actresses used in the series are choice of great people who all play there parts very well and have hooked me to the series. as i did not read the books i do not know whether it sticks to the same storyline but from what i have heard they have done it very well."
2019-05-31,beachman1997,"Greatest show, yet.",10,"1 point missing because the 8th season was rushed. no problem with the storyline of the season whatsoever, only issue was that it was rushed, a plot that could've been dragged on for 2 seasons. rest of the seasons beat all my expectations."
2019-05-14,furki-74,One of those shows...,2,"game of thrones is one of the many shows like firefly which dosnt have an ending. its starts perfectly subverting or expectations and killing of the main character in the end of the season. the only sad part is that got only has 4 seasons and the story isnt finished. so we have to read the books to learn about the ending of the story. d&d are great writers, all 4 seasons are beautifully executed and i couldnt imagine d&d writng lets say 4 bad seasons after the forth one."
2014-04-13,lamronidnih,Greatness at its finest.,5,"when we talk of greatness, this show would be a perfect definition for such word. the execution of all the artists with their respective character based from the novel by sir george rr martin is just undeniably scientific. the interpretation and processing thoughts or the writers of this show are just intelligent. this is a show about human life drawn into the world of fantasy. politics at its finest. this is a mind,blowing piece of art, really. it contains shocking revelation and twists which you cannot anticipate, for real. i am seriously attached with this magnificent tv series. and if you haven't watch this show yet, better do it now before you die. for we all know that ""valar morghulis""."

2019-05-22,jdotty96,"Watch seasons 1 - 7, and forget 8 ever existed",10,"seasons 1 , 6 of game of thrones is some of the greatest and most captivating television ever created. from everything to the acting, production value, writing, music, cinematography, you name it, game of thrones has it by the bucketload. seasons 1 - 4 are works of pure genius, whereas seasons 5 and 6 are a bit rocky at times yet still amazing. 7 is a sloppy rush job, but still enjoyable.8 though......season 8 is a betrayal of the shows purpose and premise, a inconsistent rush job cramming 2 seasons worth of plot and character development into 6 lacklustre episodes. production values (besides the odd water bottle or starbucks cup frame), music and acting are still top-notch. the writing is where problems abound and where the show falls on its big dumb face. any facade of purpose or nuance in the plot falls to the wayside, in favour of gigantic plot holes, rushed character moments and confusing story choices.overall, watch seasons 1 - 7 and make up your own mind about what happens in season 8. i assure you it will be a great deal better than what the 'writers' came up with.seasons 1 - 4 = 10/10seasons 5 - 6 = 8.5/10season 7 = 7/10season 8 = 4/10"
2020-12-12,shoelessworks,Wish I could separate seasons in my rating,8,first few seasons are 100% 10s.... the last season and even the penultimate one was baaaaad. the end ruined the entire series for me
2013-02-26,calebwininger,ugghh,10,"i couldn't disagree more with all the glowing reviews of this series. as a fan of the literary series, i wasn't optimistic about a conversion to film. the story is just too deep. there are too many characters with nuanced attributes. i never believed it could translate to film. i was right.have you ever read a ""cliff notes"" version of a classic novel? sure, it helped you get an ""a"" on your 8th grade book report, but it didn't help you appreciate the source material. that's what this series is, the cliff notes version of the war for westeros.bottom line: there is no way to distill 800 pages of excellent story,telling, character development and world-lore into twelve hours of film and do it any sort of justice. this is exactly what hbo is attempting to do with game of thrones. fail. the series is an empty husk attempting to replicate the brilliance of the novels. it just doesn't translate.what are we left with? an apparent money grab by g.r.r. martin and the starched shirts at hbo (who are trying to pimp mediocrity in the form of boardwalk empire to fill the abscess left by the sopranos).weak effort. you should have just left it alone, george. concentrate on finishing the series. please don't pull a robert jordan-act on us."
2018-12-06,sykotd,Must watch!!!!,10,getting in to the world of game of thrones is very easy and you will get lost in it re watching never gets old
2013-03-01,cutesy00,"a must watch medieval, supernatural, TV Series :))",10,"""king"" is but a mere title the people are the country the game of thrones received high ratings during its first season of airing, it had a story that gives life to our imagination of our childhood mythical bedtime stories.the setting is in a medieval time where vikings were ruling the northern seas and were the most powerful in europe during their reign. the story revolves around the (royal family) baratheon, (overthrown royals) targaryen, the stark's, lanister's, witches and gods.got, first started of with the story in northern territory of the kingdom that is made up of 7 kingdoms, the story begins with ned stark beheading a runaway knight watch member who happens to witness the white walkers reviving the dead. the story progresses on as the late king, robert baratheon, dies and his wife's son who happens to be the son of jaime lannister who is the queen's brother, takes over as king and beheads ned stark sparking a war between the northen territory, winterfell, who proclaimed themselves an independent kingdom after the death of ned.the stark children are all separated, arya in the good hands of people whom she meets along the way, sansa in the royal city, robb preparing for war with the other kingdoms who stands in his conquest of freeing them from baratheon/lanister rule, jon snow (half,blood, stark) in the far north up beyond the wall as a knight watch, bran now a limp, try to find their way back to restore their broken family.season 3 is much anticipated by viewers, because of the sudden climax of the appearance of the white walkers which seem to be pretty nasty opponents. i just hope that there would be more story on daenerys taygaryen and her dragon children."
2015-05-19,fernandogim97,"Winter Is Coming, and with it a New Era for Fantasy",1,"fantasy has, for many years, been regarded as a genre for mostly children. a few notable exceptions being the lord of the rings by j. r. r. tolkien , his dark materials by philip pullman and wheel of time by robert jordan , have defied this bias by providing imaginative and emotionally as well as intellectually resonant stories that stand among the best in english literature.genre television too, has suffered from a similar bias,turning off many viewers who have little love for complex fantasy story lines and many long,confusing names. elements such as magic or fantasy creatures have been dismissed as ""childish"" and 'simplistic"".these two would, in theory, produce a poor mix.game of thrones defies these notions even more resoundly than any work of epic fantasy before it. a staggering show full of lavish production values, dazzling visual sound effects, and above all, a raft of extremely memorable characters with their own story lines and ideals.based on george r. r. martin's ""a song of ice and fire"" novels, the main story focuses on 3 major story lines: the eternal conflict and power struggle between the great houses of westeroes known as the titular ""game of thrones"", the oncoming threat of winter and the mysterious ancient creatures it brings and the chronicle of a young girl named danaerys targaryen, last of an ancient family, and her return to westeros to exact revenge for the death of her family and downfall of her house.here we see that medieval politics,dark fantasy and classic drama are intertwined to produce a rare cross,genre hybrid. genre blending in general is risky as it can tend to produce shows that lack proper identity and purpose. game of thrones avoids these pitfalls by toning down some of the pure fantasy elements (magic, mythical creatures)and focuses more on it's political subplots and character drama, resulting in a show that appeals to both hardcore fantasy fans as well as most non-genre viewers.the writing is magnificent across the board. martin himself heavily influences the production of the show, in both managing story lines as well as the writing of the characters. much credit must be given to d.b. weiss and david benioff, showrunners on got, for extracting the best dialogue from the books for the characters to work with. given that at the time of writing of this review , the show has indeed surpassed the books' storyline, how the showrunners can continue to produce high quality drama without the great authors prose behind them remains to be seen.the acting is among the best in tv. the anchor of it all is peter dinklage's powerhouse performance as tyrion lannister, a character often described as the main reason for the show's continuing success. dinklage brings weight, dimension and humanity to a complex, riveting character that would have otherwise been wasted on any other actor. lena headey continues to shine as cersei, along with emillia clarke, maisie williams, aidan gillen and a host of other actors turning in great performances.warning to those who have yet to see the show: the show is dark in many ways more than one. the world of westeros is a parallel of the real world during the dark ages, filled with corruption, cruelty and vice. nudity, language and violence are core elements of the shown, seen in every episode. while little to none of it is tasteless, a strong stomach and a very open mind is required to truly appreciate game of thrones. the graphic and disturbing nature of the show has overwhelmed many in the past and will continue to do so. traumatic is often used to describe game of thrones, as many characters the audience comes to identify with can be and often are, brutally and unexpectedly murdered. the show can be harsh and unforgiving, a mirror of the world it portrays.game of thrones is dark. it is brutal. it asks sophisticated questions and denies us easy answers. and it is also beautiful, witty, complex and breathtaking. whatever your views on fantasy or dark drama or tv in general, it is a show that demands to be experienced.it has heralded a new age of fantasy television. we may never see the likes of it again."
2020-11-01,itair105,Best TV show ever in all history!!,1,"from the beginning until the end, this tv show is the best thing that happened on the screen ever, i don't sure if in the soon future we will see something like that.. thank you for 10 years of filming this piece of art."
2019-04-29,dom-1977,Last season ruined,6,new season is to dark to see what's happening. very disappointing
2019-05-22,ari_1995,Season 8 just sucks but the show as a whole is still amazing !,6,it's like no other show you've ever watched !! no show can match the quality of writing and picture in the first 6 seasons !! even the 8th season is a marvel of exciting and overwhelming scenes with great directing on some episodes (especially e3). i don't think it's fair to give the show 1 or 2 as a whole !! i still recommend people to watch it!!
2020-01-30,nolan_t2000,What's with the 9.3 rating?,10,so here's my question. shouldn't the imdb rating be the rating of the show as a whole in it's entirety from season 1 to the end. why is this show's rating not dropping? in my opinion season 1 is a perfect 10 and i am ok through about season 5 with this show holding a 9.3 rating. but after the last 3 seasons and in particular the very last season which in my opinion is a perfect 0.0 this show deserves no better than about 7.0. it's a shame but after an ending like that you can no longer consider this one of the greatest shows ever.
2019-05-25,rameourn,Miss judged shortcuts,7,"i don't know if it was not profitable enough or the network forced them to ended it but that was too fast. the show could've had at least two more seasons and by saying that i don't have any criticism about the main characters endings, found them very interesting and amusing, it's just the pace and frequency that i found inconvenient."
2019-05-20,mattrats,Great Show,1,"great show, one of the best of all time, never know which way the story is going. the direction and actors performances are phenomenal. however, ending was very rushed and anticlimactic, leaves a bad taste in your mouth, not literally. shame i couldn't give the show a 10/10 for this reason."
2019-05-04,sheen_z,Ruin,5,"i'v tried watch got and just like everyone enjoy it. but after watching every season i realized, watching got is waste of time!!!"
2019-07-15,bajram-bekteshi,Goat,10,it would've been a 10 if it weren't for the bad ending.
2013-05-19,llewellyn83,The best TV show running,9,"i have not had the pleasure of reading the books however, it seems that the series sticks close to them according to other reviews. it can seem drawn out in some episodes but with so much to cover i can see the challenges. overall it is a stunning masterpiece with something to grab your attention each episode. i love how the opening sequence is somewhat interactive in that it keeps up with what is going on in the story line. for me, it is the best opening sequence in a long time. if you love fantasy and i am a big fan of fantasy, you couldn't ask for more. well, maybe just to see those awesome dragons fully grown finally! i can't wait, what a spectacular series."

2019-05-31,afik_lahav,Tremendous amount of work cannot be off put because of D&D,10,we get it d&d did a terrible job writing the script for season 8 (some say even for season 7) but in my eyes the amount of work and love put into this shows out shines its disheartening ending and we should appreciate the joy and meaning this show has brought to our lives. one bad apple isn't a justification to love this show any less and for that my rating stays at 10 a true masterpiece.
2013-06-12,mrhymedog,Best.Show.On.TV,9,"it took a little while to figure out all the threads but this season has held every emotion. its crazy good. the characters are rich and complex and force you to change your opinions of them over time. the writers have created a completely different world which i buy into just like any of the great science fiction entries of the past that transported me into something extraordinary. prepare to love and hate once it sucks you in.the female characters steal the show. my absolute favorite is the youngest stark girl, arya. she is fierce and driven and remarkable, surviving everything thrown at her. the female characters are so strong, in fact, that the males , who rule the world - put their lives on the line for them...happily."
2019-05-22,santeeklaus,Almost the Greatest show...,1,"but the back half of the series really began to crumble once story material wasn't available for the writers to copy and paste from. the biggest shock and disgust comes from the final season which was suppose to have all of this payoff from years of anguish and tragedy seeing our main characters struggle, only to have an extremely rushed and sloppy ending that makes fans who watched the show ask why did i just waste my time instead of saying wow what a great series. if season 8 at the minimum was redone than the show is easily 9/10 but the ending is seriously one of the worst. the show is absolutely watchable for the most part but know the ending is very sloppy, rushed story wise, and will destroy any chance at a rewatch. they take the easy way out with villains setup from the first episode, and leaves much to be desired as an ending goes. people rating this show 10s should not be allowed to post because its a lie and they know it."
2013-06-25,god_hates,Definitely NOT The lord of the rings,10,"in most cases i find imdb ratings fairly real, but this is absolutely not the case!where should i start? well, i don't know if the people who gave this show 10 stars have ever watched any really great series so i'm hoping that this is the first show they've ever watched and they don't know what 10 stars should represent. i feel really sad when i see those 10 stars, sad for the people i mean. don't even want to think about medical (psychic) issues they must've got, even though they are pretty obvious... just to be clear, i don't mind them giving it 10 stars but that misleads other people who come here to check out what's good for watching.about the show, the idea behind the story sounds great when you hear it , seven noble families battle for the crown. yes, battle!!! well, if i'm not mistaken, there has been 30 episodes so far and maybe 4 or 5 out of 30 includes the mentioned battles. but, that's just the beginning, those couple of episodes mostly consist of people going to battle and people coming from battle. basically, you watch and wait through 8-9 episodes (out of 10) to see the battle (finally) and it lasts 2-3 minutes. see the problem? if not, make an appointment at your doctor... and for those saying that the scams and other b.s. is worth the rating, mexican telenovelas are being filmed for decades (if scams are what you're into) so check out their ratings...i won't go into spoiling the story, i'll just explain my rating:10 - boring as hell - total lack of battles (which all is about) - useless hours of character descriptions - it's following the book so 10 stars = 6anyway, if you're into watching lots of tv series like me, it's watchable like the walking dead (oh the boredom since season 2), dexter (rule no.1 never get caught - caught every season), and similar. you know, great ideas - bad production. but it's ok cause time does pass by while watching it.and remember, this is a watcher review - not a blinded book fan so it should be of help, at least i hope so.p.s. i think that the spartacus crew would have made this to be one of the best series ever, but sadly it's hbo working on it..."
2013-06-28,silver_n_black,One of the best series ever!',10,"where to even start...? this hbo tv series is absolutely awesome! without giving anything away, the show gives you all the drama and action you can ask for. from lies to war to sex to death, it's all in there.not only is the acting spot on but holding true to the books written by george r.r. martin are excellent. there is a little ad hoc changes but the books and the series is pretty much on par. what is like about the series is the realistic feeling of really being part of the action and part of the fantasy world. this is a huge bonus for followers of the books and series. another bonus is that george r.r. martin is not afraid of to stay from the status quo from other genres of this type. mr. martin has repeatedly said that no one is safe in his books. this is awesome as your always on edge awaiting the next moves from the key players in the show. this is an absolute must see tv series."
2013-08-19,jeffsupersaiyan-726-373799,Game of thrones,8,the show is ok . drags on and on . lots of homosexual propaganda. 10 episodes a season tell you that their isn't enough to write a full 20 episode season even with the amount of money going into it. if you like to watch a slow story about nothing this is the show for you. hardly any fighting or war scenes. im really surprised its still running. aren't show supposed to get better over the years they are out . oh wait 30 episodes lol what a joke. like i said earlier for the amount of money put into the show they could easily had more episodes. if they cant do it with the same quality then they really do suck. not much more to this show.
2021-07-10,emilposselt,A potentially epic show ruined by its ending,10,"the whole show is building up to the ending, which would offer some explenation of some of the plot points, dragons, white walkers, children of the forest, magic, john snow, daenerys and of course the final batlle with the night king. all the goodness leading up to season 7,8 is ruined in those seasons, and you're left dissapointed and angry at the responsible writers, don't watch..."
2016-04-03,gsaurav100-730-582948,Season by Season review,10,"whole: this show is mind,blowing. there is no other way to put it. and the reason for that is because in most shows and most movies, you feel confident that your favorite character, or the protagonist, is going to be safe (or at least until the very end of the show/movie). this show is like real world. no one is safe. anything can happen to anyone. the second reason it is mind-blowing is because this show (or the books it is derivative of) has created a whole new world, and i mean that literally. with new history, new religions, new species, new geography, new medicines, this is a different earth. couple that with a plethora of characters with such intricate personalities and motives, this show is a masterpiece. season 1: the first season of the show is extremely faithful to the book. it follows it almost exactly. it is a fairly slow season, with a lot of world building. it, however, is very interesting as you get a good look at every character you are dealing with, and shows the growing tension between every character. i thought this was a fairly decent season, however, started of a bit boring. i guarantee if you stick with it, it will be worth your time.season 2: this is where the show starts splitting away from the books a bit. this season started picking up from season 1 and actually started showing the war in action. more characters are introduced, more world building, more tension, more action. it gave some characters more spotlight and really showed us what drives them.season 3: this is where the show gets really interesting. there are so many factors at play everywhere, and all the characters start falling apart. this is where we start seeing a change in every character. it is one of the best seasons in the entire show.season 4: hands down, best season. the other 3 seasons have been building up a lot of tension and this where every thing goes down. every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat, and now we see all hell break loose.season 5: this is where the show truly turns away from the books. the show has started going down its own path, and many things that never happened in the books are happening. the first half of this season was fairly crap, with barely anything happening, and very sloppy dialogue, but as always it payed off in the second half with some of the best episodes in the entire show. conclusion: overall, definitely worth watching. though it may be slow at times, it always pays off. many book-readers are upset at how different this show has become to the books, but i am actually happy about that, as the show could never be as intricate as the books and hence following it exactly would not pay off. by following their own story the writers can make the show appropriate to its medium. lastly, this show requires serious commitment. if you are not paying attention, and are not aware of all the numerous things going on, you wont truly understand how great the show is. i recommend watching the history&lore series to help you understand this world better and learn more context."
2013-07-18,dhoommachale008008,For those who haven't read the Books.,1,"this is my first review ever and i am extremely glad it is for 'game of thrones'.in fact, this amazing and vivaciously plotted tv series made me register an imdb a/c.i am not much of a reader, as i tend to get bored just by looking at the thickness of books.i didn't even knew that the complete plot was derived from the book series 'a song of ice and fire' written by george r. r. martin, until i finished the third season and learned that the next season will commence in 2014.i will start the books just after completing this review, i can promise you that. before wrapping up, i would like to share with you all the stupid reason why i watched this series. it happened because of a pc game called 'skyrim elder scrolls v'. a friend of mine told me that there are surprising similarities between the two which i now find to be so crude.i will also warn you not to judge the series just by watching the first few episodes cause you will miss so much fun,packed adventure and a blend of versatile characters that will be imprinted into your minds for lifetime.the dialogs are so awesome and highly intellectual that they imbibe you with wisdom and nourish your inner-self.my favorite so far is 'there is power in a king's blood'.******highly recommended*****"
2018-05-31,qarishaqari,great season,9,"i have never watch a season like this i can see where the controversy surrounding this film comes from but what i don't understand is where the hate is coming from.
but lets try to understand the hate. this movie is here for one reason and i think that we can all agree on that reason. oliver stone is a competent and accomplished filmmaker and most of the hate seems to be directed towards him. stone, who is working from a script that has since been virtually disowned by quentin tarantino, pretty much took over and shaped the screenplay to his own vision."
2019-05-20,nicduffy,Such a build up and then fell flat at the end,6,"they put so much effort into all the old seasons and then just felt like a rushed ending for the last season, white walker battle was too short and terrible ending. a real waste of time show if i had to compare it to shows like dexter or the x,files for example."
2019-01-19,yeshuaevery1,So we wait...for the end,9,"love this series and while i loved the books (okay i loved books 1,3) this series has done a spectacular job realizing martin's world. you do not have to be a fan of the books to love this series, it's just phenomenally done. i'm a little worried about where hbo has taken tyrion's character in season 7, but hold out hope that hbo writers will do right by him.
i fall into the camp of not liking the sex and nudity so prevalent, especially in the first few years. reading the books i could skim over those parts and on tv it's really in your face and to me doesn't add much to the plot..but that is my personal opinion and i have a fast forward button that i can use when i want. but i did ding martin's excellent novels for it and i'll ding hbo's excellent series one small star for it as well...but despite that part, it remains one of the best series i have ever scene book adaption or not."

2014-02-25,foxtrotfelix,The perfect show,9,"i'm going to start off by saying that i haven't read the books and i definitely am going to start reading them once i have finished my exams. so this review is coming from someone who hasn't read the book. the first thing i'm going to talk about is the acting. i see shows like the walking dead that are action filled and have a decent story,line, but unfortunately the acting is where it falls flat. now, i'm not saying i don't like the walking dead; i am just stating that it would be a better show if the acting was to be improved. fortunately, this acting annoyance doesn't occur in game of thrones. the makers of the show seem to be a lot less careless when deciding who to pick and they haven't seemed to make any mistakes when deciding big roles. tyrion's trial scene in season four was one example of how good the acting is and it remains as my favourite scene throughout all seasons. second of all, the story-line. i haven't read the books and so i couldn't comment on how they have changed the story-line from the books to the show, but what i can say, is that the show has a story-line that gets you to check how many minutes you've watched of each episode in hope there is still lots left to go. sadly, time flies by when watching quality television and so the game of thrones episodes feel way too short. finally, i'm going to talk landscapes. now i'm not sure where they film everything, but it makes you think it's on an entirely different planet when you see the stunning imagery. there are many more things i could point out in this show, but i'm running out of time. to summarise, this show is action filled, has a good story-line, has strong characters from both genders and the acting is perfect."
2015-01-07,bonniers,The best show currently airing!,1,"to be honest i haven't watched especially many shows in my life, tv has never really been my cup of tea. but i still believe that game of thrones has to be the best show airing right now, there is no way that any other show could reach this level of awesomeness.the best part of game of thrones are the characters, although there are so many of them that at times it is hard to remember all their names. however, they are all very unique and the actors portraying them do it really well, it is very hard imagining someone else than peter dinklage playing the role of tyrion. the atmosphere is very varied during the different parts of the show, we have the political intrigues in kings landing, the great battles and the supernatural elements.game of thrones compiles everything great with all the previous fantasy films and shows, mashes them together to form something truly unique. the epicness of the lord of the rings franchise and the realism and darkness of pan's labyrinth. the fact that it is made for adults is probably its greatest strength when compared to other fantasy shows or movies made in the last 5,10 years. it is not full of cgi, the show is very graphic when it comes to language udity/violence and it gives a lot of time for character development. the show is also very unpredictable, the characters are never far from being killed off, something that separates it from most other shows/movies in the fantasy genre. i would recommend this series to anyone interested in fantasy, politics or general awesomeness but beware, this is not for the light hearted! having watched all four seasons, i gladly give this 10/10."
2019-05-16,ehfo0777,Do not start watching...,9,they just introduce character and then killed them brutally... there is a character name jon snow with a thick plot armor...but that it...new character and then their death all that is to it

2015-05-25,smajla82,Top class TV show,10,"so i'm writing my first review just because people here at imdb(not only here) cant review without prejudice. 1=awful 10=excellent based on this...please ignore all 1 ratings or garbage ratings ,these people are immature people who just hate movie/show based on their own expectations coming out from their personal experience.if 5 is average then i would say this show, just for effects,realism,camera,music score! etc...deserves at least 5. all above is really above average. i didn't liked the hype either form the start and i started watching in 2013 i think...first two episodes from series one wasn't enough, there was just too much confusion and it was hard for me to concentrate/orient in everything going on the screen. third(s01e03) was like a bait for fish. it completely hooked me up and just had to watch the rest. after i watched first two seasons ...i couldn't wait any longer and i bought the books. ...rest is not important.anyway there are some flaws and cliché i think, but as a whole pack this show is on top along with breaking bad."
2021-08-17,toby_maughan,This was so close to being the best thing ever made,9,"bar the final season and maybe s7, everything was amazing about this show. the cast, the story lines, the music. ramin djawadi is a genius. but at the end of the day, season 8 was horrible, and that's what will be remembered about got."

2019-05-25,manishkashwani,Where's the REVENGE?,10,"game of thrones is undoubtedly one of the best show in the world but the storyline does fade away after a while. the audience loves game of thrones because of the characters, the villains for their cruelty and the heroes for their thirst for revenge.
but as the storyline proceeds you will feel sympathetic towards the villains and thus the wait for revenge vanishes instantly and there is nothing else left to see.
where's the revenge?"
2019-05-21,akhil-marsonya27,A Message to Dan and Dave,10,"dear dan and dave,i have long been a huge fan and an avid supporter of game of thrones all the way since season 1, granted i regretfully have not had the joys of reading any of the wonderful george rr martins books. i have, however spent hundreds of hours exploring the game of thrones lore, history of westeros, fan theories, detailed interviews and everything in,between - it's fair to say i'm a more passion fan than most.i am no hollywood writer - or in fact any writer for that matter - but i believe i share the opinion of so many got fans. i want to start off by saying thank you. thank you to the visual effects crew, stunt co-ordinators, body doubles, extras, set designers, costume designers, camera men, george rr martin, directors, the brilliant actors and so many other people behind the scenes of this once all-time great show - not only have we the fans been incredibly let down, but the people who have put their physical blood, sweat and tears into the show have also had their beautiful hard work defiled.i could go into incredible detail about all the things wrong with this season, some notable events: jon being exiled for killing danny who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people, jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of danny going mad, bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, drogon flying off into the 'sunset', rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of sansa and arya's when jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... he literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.with the holes in the show - and there as so many - i think it's a pathetic excuse of an ending. hbo wanted 10 seasons, but foolishly dan weiss and david benioff decided they had enough, they wanted to wrap the show up so they could make mountains of money butchering yet another beloved franchise (star wars). i understand that not everything deserves a happy and perfect ending, nor can you please everyone. however, we spent nearly a decade following these wonderful characters, watching them develop and intelligently interact with each other since season 1. the ending to this show will never be forgotten, for the wrong reasons unfortunately. i hope dan and david come out and apologise to the fans, we are the people that kept the show running, without the fans support there would have been no game of thrones on tv at all.the characters deserved better. the whole crew deserved better. the fans deserved better. george deserved better.regards, a game of thrones fanoriginally posted by channelsergeant on game of thrones s08e06"

2019-05-26,crim-,The most evil ruler of the 7 kingdoms,8,"i'm not a member of many sites online but haven't heard my own theory on the game of thrones ending;bran will actually be the biggest tyrant the 7 kingdoms have ever seen.he can see all, his power allows him to understand the past and the future, a reason why they decided to choose him. bran himself mentioned things such as 'you were exactly where you needed to be' when john thought he had failed. what does this tell you?he manipulated all the main players in the most subtle of ways, he knew that daenerys needed to be pushed over the edge and destroy a city, killing many innocent people, as that was the only way she would die in a way that would lead to him being chosen as king. everyone that died since bran became the 3 eyed raven died at the right time for the next events to unfold as they did, a butterfly effect where he controls all the butterflies. even the poor tactical decisions during the big battles were due to him, we saw him warg during the long night battle without understanding why, but he made everything happen exactly as it did, probably even controlling the night king as well, we know he was in control and fully calm at the moment arya killed him. all so that moment he was chosen as king instead of anyone else would happen, and his reign of tyranny could begin. the start of a lifetime of revenge against a world that crippled him and murdered his father...now the sad bit where i review the show;game of thrones could have been the greatest show ever made, but it needed to be consistent for that to be possible, something that just didn't happen. most intelligent people would be able to tell the writing took a dive as early as season 5, i'm sure many people gave the writers the benefit of the doubt as from there they were relying less and less on grrm so needed time to find their feet. unfortunately by the time we hit season 7 onwards it was predictable this show wouldn't end well.season 8 was by far the worst season, to the point of destroying its legacy. maybe fans with blinkers on don't understand the hate it's been getting and feel it's solely due to the way the story ended, but it's not really. it was the journey that changed for the worse and that is what would attract new viewers, it became predicable and almost childlike in its execution as it drew closer to the end, terrible writing, plot holes, very predicable.ultimately, this has damaged the game of thrones brand (hopefully not irreparably), this show won't be recommended to new people as often, it will likely be forgotten in the years to come whereas the books will not (assuming they do get finished). let's hope grrm finishes the books and that inspires a true to the books adaption in the years to come. i would expect d&d will not be allowed anywhere near that, and rightly so.i gave this a 6/10 which i feel is probably generous (if the quality of seasons 1,4 were maintained it would have been an easy 10, there were also some glimmers of hope in season 6 that it could recover). a show has to be rated as a whole and unfortunately the last seasons pull the rating down quite a bit."
2020-02-09,nachochip420,Initially a 10 but ended as a 7,8,"i initially had the show rated as 10/10. it started as a total masterpiece, the show that many others would try to emulate for decades. and then the final season happened. so disgraceful that the writers decided to just wrap it up as fast as possible and move on to more profitable ventures. the last season is so inconsistent and poorly written that is ridiculous. i wonder why hbo did not stop it before it was premiered. even the actors were appalled."
2019-05-13,sppash101,What could've been,1,"this was arguably one of the greatest shows of all time, but then the last season happen. if you want to learn how to ruin a near perfect show. this is it. i don't need to see the last episode to know how it will end now. not one thing they do now could possibly make up for this garbage of a season."
2019-05-20,dannywoods11,Simply amazing,10,"i loved jon's story. very seldom in life do we get our fairytale ending. we make choices, mistakes, and decisions that change our narrative, and we learn to carry on. jon's story was really great in terms if relatability. he didnt get the kingdom, didnt get the girl, didn't even get winterfell. tragic of course, but it makes me love the story much more. most television shows, books, and movies, give the hero all the glory. i know this season had its hiccups, and i'll never understand why jon didnt get the night king kill, yet, the ending to jon snow was perfect."

2014-06-03,alexdconstantin,A medieval soap,9,"nice set designs, but boy oh boy... terrible cast except 2,3 actors, slow development of the plots which are ultra diluted and have very late resolutions, not to mention the dose of pornography and incest which could have been suggested not shown in excess. the explicit contentdiminish the fantasy effect of the stories. winter is coming for 4 seasons, i was hoping sean bean will be alive when winter was coming. by the look of it all the main characters will die before winter. we get it the evil characters live longer than the good ones, but they tend to stop in their character development becoming predictable. like bad acting was not enough there are hundreds of unnecessary monologues and tiny intrigues to ''feast'' your ears. apparently 6 millions per episode can't change that and for some it's money well spent. here is a suggestion: put the money into more dragon's scenes and more north of the wall scenes."

2015-03-22,livemoo1,Who is who and what now?,10,"everyone is so dull and i can't tell who is who. at least have some easier names for people to understand them. i call everyone person 1 and bearded man. at least have people understand what is happening. this show is just so stubborn. after 3 episodes, i was done and decided to spend my time better watching anything else that this garbage. the writer of this show should just stop trying to make people like these characters and stop trying to make these people cool. game of thrones is just messed up, george martin is ok and should spend his time better and could do better. you kill 1 of the most popular actors in the show and make people hate the prince geek. i think this show is just a waste of time to all the viewers and of they like it, ok for them. they can sit through garbage writing and acting and i salute you all."
2014-03-26,akasomeguy-js,Depressing Muck,1,"this show and i assume the book(if the show is anyway accurate) paint a very depressing and twisted look into the human mind. the minute any character shows any decency, honor, loyalty or trust. they are shown to be weak and foolish then killed off. not only are cruelty, deceit and selfishness needed to gain power and wealth, these characteristics are also needed to find justice for those who have been wronged. this means that any character that wants justice or to perform good deeds has to betray the principles they stand for to achieve these goals. i see no originality in this show only gratuitous violence and endless betrayal and backstabbing. any 2 people who marry for love rather than power and wealth end up dead, so it is a fantasy world where happiness in unattainable as the wealthy and powerful are miserable fighting to hold what they have and acquire more and anyone not concerned with these things gets trampled on and used. it seems the the author of game of thrones may be quite right though since the books and show are so popular humans really do enjoy violence and treachery. production values are good."

2019-05-17,ashter-haider,Season 8 is almost perfect,9,"a lot of people complain that the shifts in a lot of characters' arcs felt too sudden in this episode. they're not wrong. because they also did for the characters themselves, as the entire episode is about who we all are, or what we reveal ourselves to be the moment fear takes control of us. it's sudden and dramatic by fear's very nature. the episode's title, ""the bells"", even calls to attention the precise instant this happens for most of our key characters. we see it in the war scene itself. it's not so much ""one good side versus one bad side"" as much as it is just one collective mass of people scared fighting for their lives, and all it takes is one catalyst to bring that collective fear all the way to the forefront and, amidst pure chaos, for everyone to find out who they truly are.
dany is that catalyst. as we know, she is already afraid. but once she hears the bells of surrender in king's landing, that's the moment the fear fully takes hold of her. the throne, the one thing she's always wanted is now finally hers for the taking. the people of king's landing do not love her, and she will not lose the product of her life's work the way she did everything else, so she does the only other thing she sees she can do: ""let it be fear"". she torches the city.
so, motivated by fear, this is the very moment she puts the fear in everyone else. the walls break down completely. all masks come off. everyone's true selves and desires rush to the forefront.
grey worm, feeling only wrath from the love taken from him, seizes this opportunity to massacre innocent surrendering forces.
formerly surrendering forces fight for their lives. they want only to survive.
some of the victorious forces of the north do the same, while others seize the opportunity to wreak savagery upon innocents. it's who they were all along, and we've taken their good will for granted.
we've all seen jon snow's face of realization: ""this is wrong. this was wrong all along."" from that point on, he can only make futile attempts to correct what can't be undone.
knowing it's all over, cersei's thoughts turn entirely to her unborn child. it's not about ""who wins"" the throne anymore. to her, the throne was merely her and her family's refuge, a refuge she held by committing countless evils in the name of protecting herself and those she loved. now, all she knows is that she cannot let her unborn baby die, not here. she flees. she weeps for her child.
and even among all of this, the sound of the bells was only the moment the fear hit most of our characters. others had fear take control of them slightly prior, but the bells served as the crossroads for those very fears nonetheless.
the moment fear took control of jaime was one episode prior. by every observable metric, he was a changed man that had every intention of atoning for his past. but the moment sansa told him that cersei would be executed without him, that's when his fear took hold. he could not let the woman he'd loved his entire life, from the moment of their birth, die without him there. it was not a ""reversal"" or ""squandering"" of his character arc. he had indeed become a better man. but he was the only person to ever see that side of cersei, and he was afraid to let it die. even at the moment of he and cersei's death, he tells her ""it's just us, that's all that matters"". the fear made him realize that his memory of that love is all he would have been content with, and given familial love being the sole motivator for all of cersei's sociopathy, it was literally his answer to her lifelong struggle.
obviously, the hound fears his brother. he knows this crossroads at king's landing is his chance. he fears not getting revenge, and arya thinks she shares this in common with him. so as a litmus test, he makes it as clear as he can to arya: if you follow me down this path, you will die.
and despite all her talk, that is the moment the fear hits arya. she doesn't want to die. she runs through the streets trying to escape, and in doing so finds that she doesn't want the people to die as well. fear triggers her survival impulses, not just for herself, but for others as well. she's afraid to die. there's more she needs to do. there's more everyone needs to do.
and lastly, or firstly rather, seeing the crisis of ""the bells"" coming days in advance in true character fashion, varys remains the person he's always been. he fears the wrong person being seated on the throne, one that leads by instilling this very fear in them at all, the fear that arises from fire and blood.
and that, my friends, is why this episode is brilliant. it is pure game of thrones. we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood, and some bone to keep it all standing. when life,or-death fear hits, we become our basest, most elemental selves, and no one is invulnerable.
characters' arcs shift fast because the whole episode is about fear and who we reveal ourselves to be once that fear is put in us."
2014-05-17,arvamihai,"Acting, Screenplay, Directing, Storyline, Characters, Sounds and Music",10,"puff, were to start from?!i watched approx. 10.000 movies and about a hundred of tv series, the modesty i know, i know... anyway the reason i write this review is to share with you all my thoughts...some of you may like it some of you may not, it's a free world and i respect you choice ! if some of you will say it's a matter of taste i support you guys too. anyway again that being said lets start:the ""game of thrones"" ... (background music: angels singing halleluiah)the storyline is absolutely epic, the strength point of this series is that the intrigue levels are so deep you need a big flowchart or a map to fully understand how the characters evolve, involve, interact, disappear, experience the unknown and so on, i can take any of the characters and subtracts lots of connections with other characters, and this web of intrigue levels makes this series a gamble. a gamble in what sense, well this complex net makes an achilles weak point, if the director of this film would not make a good directing, all this complex relations between the characters will fall over his work and boom, disaster! is like building a space ship for the first time or so, you want the reach the stars but you have to think to 1000 things on every step, that's challenging and i respect the director for his work, good job !characters, a very good acting skills, they are not flawless, but i think everyone contributes to this grater good, the good of the film, and overall they do a wonderful job. i like and think the idea of the undead, to be more specific the frozen undead, to be an blizzard idea from the warcraft i guess (only a thought). it's a bit bloody in the actions and wars but hey it's a damn realistic for that era. good costumes, acceptable cgi(dragons are a bit celisse), but hey overall captures you attention fully. mystical symbols, raven , trees, wolves, swords of some material and so on, makes the series catchy and easy to remember. i think people are very susceptible to this sort of symbols and like them, as a marketing view point its the smart choice that adds commercial value to the movie although i personalty think its kinda silly.i will not spoil anything, maybe some of you haven't see all the series, but i liked the acting of theon greyjoy (very good acting skill).sounds and music are very carefully selected and it matches perfectly the mood of the series every episode. i personally don't like the long intro but, i can pas over it. i like the fact that conversation generally doesn't stack over the background sounds, this is a simple and a clean idea which i appreciate, it shows that your attention should be focused on the conversation, and every conversation adds value and new meaning on the evolution of the characters and the story.things i don't like: 1.long intro, damn it's long start already i want to see... (i think every time i look at new episode) 2.dragons, raven, rituals, and other smoked symbols (celisse my opinion) 3.lack of big and more open spaces (usually fields, castles and sea)things i like: 1.acting 2.the stories and scenes 3.characters, lots of races and types, complex connection between them 4.sound and music pops the interest 5.everything else.if you have another opinion feel free to get the f__k off! :)"
2017-08-29,mjrobinb,It's simply the best! Every episode is like a movie,9,"i started watching this about 2 years ago, because everyone told it was so good and interesting.so in the first few episodes it seems like a total sci,fi. but it just keeps getting better with episode and then you're just can't wait to see the next episode.i have seen all episodes and just finished the season 7. it is just amazing, it's the best and i think everyone should see it!every episode has so many details and the story through the seasons is quite complicated, but it's amazing that we have this show.superb quality and a must watch!"
2019-05-20,james-a-durrell,A once amazing show ruined by it's ending,9,"this show is absolutely stunning. it contains some of the most well fleshed out characters and plotlines ever written, containing gripping plot twists and unmatched character dialogue. however, this is not true for the entire series. seasons 1,6 are incredibly written and acted, and remain the pinnacle of modern television. season 7, while still great, is just that. fabulous and entertaining, yet not golden. the final season and it's ending, however, have ruined the show, and will leave you feeling utterly disappointed and dismassed.while previous seasons have featured stunning plot points and made revolutionary contributions to modern storytelling, the final season and it's conclusion lacks any semblance of these previous seasons, ignoring seasons of character development, illogical plotlines, and absurd dialogue. the whole season feels so out of place and nonsensical that it tarnishes the legacy of game of thrones. after seventy-odd episodes of epic build-up, game of thrones is a frustrating let down with a poorly written conclusion. plotlines built up over seven seasons vanish with no payoff, and characters you are so vested in suddenly lose their multi-faceted layers of development in a confusingly written mess. because of this, i sadly recommend avoiding the series completely."
2019-05-20,aman-29-649515,Why GOT why,10,you could have discontinued the show instead ending it in such bad way. u have ruined your 8 years of hard work.
2014-07-03,jeremyaturk,Could have been so great...,10,"so many have reviewed this so i don't have to go on and on about the entire premise. i do have to say, because i really think it should be said, that there is so much potential here, but it's ruined. the lighting, the directing, the cinematography, the production value, the wardrobe, all so well done. it's beautiful...so why only four stars? it's filled with so many gratuitous sex scenes. any way you like it: gay, lesbian, bi, straight, incestuous, sex while murdering... the list goes on and on. i really like sex. i do! i like it in movies and i like it in shows, but this is ridiculous. almost none of it drives the story. none of it is really necessary at all, but sometimes it's nice to have a nice tasteful love scene. in this case it's a ploy to get ratings. it appears to have worked! my next complaint is about something that they could not have changed as it is part of the story from the books, but this is my review and i can give my opinion (shared by many.) they kill every character that you care about. then, they introduce some new characters for you to like, and they kill them off. the bad guy wins. that is what they are trying to convey. it may be their prerogative to convey it, but i don't have to watch it. so i don't. i stopped watching. i just couldn't take it any more.the sad part is that there is so much good in this series. i really like the concept of the white walkers. i like their take on dragons. the whole aesthetic is so well done. the world they have created is quite breathtaking. i just wish i could bring myself to watch it. the story just stinks. oh well, there are plenty of people that like it so this is just one man's opinion."

2014-09-12,ihatemarcwebb,"A Tasteless, Boring Mess!!!",6,"no major spoilers!!!!this review is solely based on the pilot episode. or should i say the first 35 minutes of it. i know what you all are going to say. i need to let the show get going before i can make a formal review. to that, i say, ""get some expectations, you stupid moron!"". i mean, are you kidding? why should i have to wait? the opening moments of the show should draw you in, and get you invested. not just be a 35 second shot of a rising gate, and then shifting to a shot of a group of stupid looking barbarians with accents so thick, i can hardly understand them. then we get a couple of jump scares so pathetic, they won't even scare a 2,year-old, which only serves to show a brief glimpse of a member of a cannibalistic tribe(?). that whole scene was 8 minutes long, and i'm already almost asleep. with imdb's stupid guidelines, that probably counts as a spoiler, even thought it's way too boring to be one, so i checked the box anyway because i don't want to be put on their blacklist, like i have many times in the past.we then get introduced to some random kingdom with kit harington living in it (oh no!!!), and that's where the plot completely stops. everything from this point onwards is just boring, uninteresting talking between a bunch of d-list actors sporting accents that only people living in the uk will understand. all the little interest that i had was instantly flushed away, and i was forced to spend the remaining time in the episode desperately trying to figure out the plot, and what was going on.sadly the excess of talking is only the largest problem in this disaster of a show. things such as lack of motives, and unlikeable characters only magnify this show's ineptness. as much as i'd like to talk about these things, i don't have all day to do this review, and i have much better things to do in my life than to vent about this stupid show. the visual effects and high production values are the only things saving this show from getting a 1.1/4"
2019-05-20,mr-kolding,No longer worthy of the best series ever,10,"giving this series a common grade is wrong as the seasons are incomparable! seasons 1,3 were none other than amazing! the mind games, the unpredictable twists and plots were unparalleled! 10 stars.
season 4 was great, but things started getting sloppy. 7 stars
seasons 5-6 were predictable and was drained of any form of creativity and had very clear signs that this was now nothing more than a money-maker. 3 stars.
seasons 7-8 was... well... as plasticky and cheaply made the rock formations in the set... 1 star.
only 4 stars from me as the majority of the series was way below what was expected when setting the standard with s1-3."
2019-05-06,azoz199494,Boring,7,"episode 4 is boring as hell, 72 mins is too long for the goal of it .this show start to go down."
2014-09-15,apkieran,George g...RRR Martin is Horrible,3,"the worst show to match one of the worst authors of all time. so unpredictably silly, it's predictably hilarious; what a concept!?!?! his prose (or lack thereof) is horrendous and the funniest thing about the show is that it comes off just as dry and bland as it does in the books. for avid fantasy readers it is insufferable to read and watch the blatant and sometimes subtle literary theft,cover-up-change-a-tad often dished out on the pages. if we were to punish for the crime of literary theft, then he'd be serving a life sentence! the show receives at least a star for a so-so cast of actors that try to pull off the impossible and make the story actually interesting and worthy of a bag of popcorn, but in the end the show is not something you'll be binge watching anytime soon."
2019-05-19,fbgi97,Best show ever,9,they will be not tv show like game of thrones it is the best ever
2019-08-08,tashreeeves,Amazing but with fault,1,"when i first started watching, when season 2 had just aired i initially rated a 10/10, after season 8 this rating has to be changed. there is no denying that the first four season of this show are a master piece. from the music, acting, story telling, world building, got will ruin any other tv programme for you. nothing will be able to compete; it's that spectacular. however, after season four it's clear that the diverges from the source material, with season 5, 6 and 7 containing elements of martin's story but not having the same complexion or flawless dialogue.
season 8 is the true downfall to this master piece, the writing is rushed (despite the two years it took to write) and lackluster, leaving the final season with no true resolution. yet, it's not the actual ending that is disappointing rather the story of how it came to be. the ending of a story is not that significant, shakespeare spoiled all his plays within the opening act what's more important is how that ending is reached, a feat that got couldn't complete in it's final season.
nevertheless, i would still recommend this show to anyone as it is a piece of art work, but will now always warn that the ending is frankly awful."
2018-05-30,mantalist-me,I never watch something like this,10,"the only show that i saw that gets better with every season, i don't to spoil anything bat if you start watching got you can't stop."
2018-07-30,kieronoverbury,The greatest show ever,7,"i never read any novels until i saw this show, (three times), i then had to read the books, epic characters, the good and the bad, their all entertaining, a massive world with history's and lore's across the whole two continents of essos and westeros. i would say if you have not seen it, then rectify that please. epic fantasy!"
2019-07-01,eleniboul1,GAME OF THRONES,10,"we probably will not see like this again, but i am very disappointed for the end of the series and in particular from the eighth season. and mr kit harington must speaks better to the fans who supported the game of thrones from the start to the end.
my rating for the whole series is 10 but for the last season is 1."
2014-12-25,animevillain,Game of Thrones Sucks,9,"the show suffers from pis (plot induced stupidity) or cis (character induced stupidity).examples will ned stark trusting little finger, and the queen. if ned is a lord of a house, then he has experience spotting deception. if ned is this stupid, then pis if house bolton did not destroy house star early on. the plot goes nowhere, an example will be the first 2 seasons.the first season was slow, and the second season was a snore.the dialogue sometimes are boring. the reason is because the script is badly written.characters (some) are dull with no life to them.lots of the characters are 1 to 2 dimensional.many of the characters aren't explored. the show has to throw sex to get you interested, and care for this cra@p.the show wastes time on nudity, and has a long opening.the show itself does not deliver anything.it gives an illusions that it accomplished something.you have to wait for the battles for a long time, while .if interesting things happen, its only for shock value. most of the characters,and things that happen in this show. it does not benefit the story. its definitely not a dark fantasy.this show is a medieval torture porn.the show is predictable that the good guys lose. its the opposite of lord of the rings where the good guys win.there is no balance between good vs evil like the show claims itself to be."
2019-05-20,jmbarcenas,Disappointed,10,"this show had so much potential, i'm really really excited for the closure, and we got season 8. sad"
2019-08-30,collins0477,Okay Tv series,8,take out the special effects and you have got a very ordinary tv show it has it's moments but come on how and mean how can it be rated higher than sopranos i do not know.
2019-05-20,fwretner,The ending ruins the entire show,10,"the greatest tv,shows always seems to pick up the pace as time goes on, which is true even for game of thrones but for all the wrong reason. the first 6 season was excellent and borderline perfect but during season 7 we got hints of what was about to come. characters not acting like themselves, nonsensical dialouge and incredibly poor and sloppy writing. season 8 in fact feels very rushed, which is wierd considering they took 2 years to make the final season. what i think hinders the last season the most is the decision to only have 6 (!) episodes. because of this they had to push characters and storlylines in a way that made no sense att all. none of the endings of the main plotlines felt satisfying because it didn't feel like we got an actual ending, everything happens so fast and gets brushed aside in seconds. several things are put in place and are said to be extremely important and affect the plot but are meaningless in the end. jon snow's heritage and resurrection being two examples but perhaps the worst part is how they dealt with the white walkers in s08e03 as they are defeated in a single episode where nothing makes sense and the producers keep pulling cheap tricks on us to think characters are dead but then cuts away.the ending is terrible. there are so many things wrong with the final episode and it will without a doubt go down as one of the worst finales to ever exist. hopefully season 8 gets remade and we get the conclusion we all deserve."
2018-09-06,gata-hermosilla,Best series ever,10,"it has a great plot, the story is really good and all the secrets that some of the characters known are really shocking, it's one of my favorite series"
2020-01-31,fallenfromtoday,Everything was brilliant until...,9,"i wanted to give this a 10/10 but i don't quite understand how you can take a character you built up from this timid abused girl into one of the most powerful caring rulers and then with a snap of your fingers she's evil? i just don't understand, i feel like the journey should have ended with her becoming a great queen, especially because she would have had jon by her side. if they were suppose to be so in love, which was portrayed awesomely, then she couldn't and wouldn't have slaughtered a whole city of innocent people, you don't love a few and decided to kill hundreds a day later. you're usually evil like cersei your whole life. jon could have been her king, what was up with his relation? did he really need to be related? what purpose did it serve, seriously? it was a great story as him being a uniting all of those people, wildlings, the nights watch and northerners alike to fight together! all done by a man who wanted nothing in return but to help his people. wasn't that plot alone the greatest part of history? why the hell would you change that to make dany and jon related? and besides the fact who cares, they didn't grow up in a sandbox together, they didn't go to family dinners, change each other's diapers sorta deal. if the lannister's could be so open then why couldn't jon and dany have each other? how long did we wait for that? like forever. i just can't wrap my head around the end. bran the robot in a wheelchair is king now? what purpose did his character serve either? he didn't help stop the night king, he sat in a chair and did nothing. watching jon kill dany broke my heart, and then after all that, he has to back to castle black? ""thanks man for saving us all again, bye!"""
2019-05-20,sherjeel_73,A question from D&D,8,i had given it 10/10 rating but now i've changed it to 1/10 and posting here a question for the mighty d&d: why the hell does king bran needs a master of whisperers when he knows everything??
2020-07-26,deepak-8014,Half rating for a half show,10,"it was an incredible show until benioff and weiss used there own brain. fans know what i'm talking about. they never were the right people to be helm of this show. if you re,watch it, you can even tell that which part are martin's and which part is there own imagination. that's how much bad they were. although actors were the saving grace for the last 4 seaosns. i hope martin's books could do better justice to it."
2018-12-07,sahanmoradeniya,Beyond the tradition,7,the cast is superb. this will open fan eyes to a new dimension. organised as a religion. you will never see an intriguing tv series like this even in next decade.
2019-05-22,nishanthbmme,Season 1-4 are PERFECTIONS Season 7-8 are DISASTERS,10,"it pains me so much to give this amazing show anything below a perfect rating, but it must be done. seasons 1,4 were absolutely perfect. the flaws started to show when they ruined the dornish plotline and ruined stannis' character in season 5.season 6 had great moments but the plot was slowly moving away from character-oriented plots to ""le epic tv moments"".season 7 and season 8 devolved into horrible cliches and fell for the typical fantasy-genre tropes while pretending to be the opposite of that. the ending was lackluster and rushed. it is obvious that d&d just want to be done with this and move on to bigger projects like star wars."
2019-04-29,toohayyogibear,I hate this show.,8,"i was wondering who is going to be the bigger threat the knight king or cersei and in this episode they did the unexpected and just killed the night king. what an episode. rip theon, you legend, what is dead will never die. he died so arya could kill the nk, well played bran.
for a mid season episode this was golden. a moment in tv show history. this only shows that majority of the remaining character are possibly dying in the next few episode.
the only gripe i have with this episode is the random cutaway when charaters are in danger. it was done way too many times and was getting abit annoying."

2019-05-20,greatluckchuck,Popular Doesn't Automatically Equate to Quality,9,"this show is the mcdonald's of tv. shallow, bland, contrived. hopefully the fans of this can eventually find the quality shows that lurk in their dashboards instead of consuming the content that is shoved in their faces."
2019-05-21,fatososmani,That's the best series of all timd,10,"i personaly don't know what did the fans expect,a happy ending? this was and will always be nr.1 no matter the ending who in my opinion was close to perfect"
2018-11-11,debojyoti-55039,BEST TELEVISION SERIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED,6,"marvel cinematic universe is my most favourite movie series and game of thrones is my most favourite television series i have ever watched. before i started watching this, i didn't have a good view on this series and used to think that it was useless. but trust me.... after i started watching this, my idea completely changed and i became a hardcore fan of this amazing series. those who haven't watched game of thrones are definitely missing one of the greatest silver screen wonders. i request everyone to watch this before season 8 comes out in 2019. believe me, you will thank me for taking my advice to watch this spectacular thing."
2019-05-23,frenkyboyhun,"Shame, Shame, Shame",9,"7 fantastic season, and one of the worst final season of my life."
2016-05-15,jodwightfrye,Winner of Thrones!,7,"this show is not only the best show i've ever seen, it is always like watching a cinematic movie. from moment to moment, sides change and people you love may die. it never leaves you disappointed and there are no bad episodes...just some that may change your complete attitude for another character; always changing loyalties and building new alliances. and that is where the show always surprises and shocks. you never know, but you'll never forget. the actors/actresses are so skilled in making this show a gem. they can go from good to bad to worst. the rotten ones will blow your mind with their talents. you will most probably watch each episode several times to sync your mind with the names of all the characters...i never get bored watching the older episodes. you will find things you missed, and covert operations between kingdoms that will shock and thrill you. i'm not giving anything away, as you will want to discover each episode and character for yourself. plenty of loved ones and people who you wish to die...sometimes shortly before they do. this story could go on forever, and you will want it to. don't miss this...you will want to get involved immediately!valar marghulis. valar dohaeris."
2015-05-27,lealyagalang,Absolutely groundbreaking!,10,"if you're looking for your usual, cliché, implicit epic,fantasy story, then this is not it.everything is just raw and brutal, serving more than what you've asked for but certainly exceeding your expectations for the better. i may have read the books, but the spin of the characters in the series highlights the supporting ones and adds their weights and purpose for the story. jaw-dropping, if one might say. the cuts of the scenes are also terrific, making viewers want more. possibly the best tv-show as of today. game of thrones certainly made its own name under the epic-fiction genre, even creating its own original division."
2015-06-06,kenyhigy,Had enough of sadistic violence.,10,"have to say that shortly after the start of season five i have become weary of so much sadistic violence over and over again and not anything good ever happening. the story line keeps dragging on and on with seemingly only new angles on just what different and graphic forms of killing and mutilation can be devised and delivered with optimum special effects. it is a game of thrones and a game where not only nobody wins but just how badly everyone loses, one at a time, told in layered story groupings, episode after episode. enough already. apparently this is what keeps the series ratings high and i just no longer want to be a part of this feed so goodbye game of thrones."
2019-12-25,abdulrahman-60203,Fan Favourite Jon,1,"the show was good overall..lots say season 1,6 is the best of all that's true, season 7 went down in ratinbut season to me was good except for jon snow punishment to join the nights watch..at least he could have joined arya on her quest, they love each a lot it would have been fun..overall it was good not the best though..just hope blood moon will be better"
2019-06-07,faresshaikh,Worst ending ever,10,no doubt this is the best tv show with the worst end ever !! really was disappointing for all audiences
2018-08-22,msaisisir,the best,10,the best tv seires i have ever watched.the plot and the way characterisation is done evrything is incrdible.just you cant predict the outcome at any point of time.go for it
2017-05-24,lukewhite,Speechless mate,9,"ok i'm gonna just say that this is probably the best show that's ever  aired like no doubt. i was never really a fan of lord of the rings and  fantasy so i didn't think this show was gonna be as good as everyone  said it was. i couldn't have been more wrong. it is epic!   you start off with you know pretty good stuff there's a twist at the  start which gets you into it and then it builds up and then at the end  of the first season you're like wtf just happened?! how can they do  that lol this is good. yeah so you're like damn this is a good show  still not as good as like sopranos or breaking bad or whatever. then  you get through season 2 and you're still thinking this is a damn good  show then once again at the end you're like this is sick! then you get  to 3&4 and you know that this is the best show out there. i can't  explain and i don't wanna tick the spoiler box so i'm gonna just say  some serious 'stuff' goes down. twists like once an episode, battles  which are epic, some emotional stuff as well. game of thrones does  annoy you with the stuff they do sometimes but there is this one bit  which is a massive 'hell yeah' moment which seems like a treat for the  fans. then season 5 is a little bit under the usual standard i must  say, still amazing though, but the last few episodes of it are still  sick, probably some of the best there. season 6 is my personal  favourite though. it is amazing! so much stuff that you can't even  imagine it's just too good. i'm not even gonna say anything it's just  incredible.   this show is the most well acted, directed, written, produced show out  there. the budget is phenomenal and you can tell in the episodes. the  work they must put into every aspect of the show is incredible. the  massively well planned twists, the incredible battle scenes, the  humour, the connection with the characters; it all is just so so good.  i cannot wait for season 7 and i bet its gonna somehow be better than  the show is already. best show out there i'm telling you. if you haven't  seen it yet, watch it.  (i couldn't swear in this and i really ******* wanted to)"
2015-07-01,brandodragonberg,Totally hooked,10,"i don't think there is much else that can be written here about this incredible series. but i thought of adding my personal angle on the experience, as i am totally, irrevocably hooked on this show and cannot wait to see the rest of it. when i first started to watch it i actually found it a bit boring. i was never a real fan of fantasy, disliked the lord of the rings series and thought this would not escalate on my priority list. bt so many friends were talking about it that i thought of giving it a chance. i had a similar experience with breaking bad, so it was worth trying. it took 5 or 6 episodes of season 1 to get there, but very soon i became completely addicted to the show, to its characters, to its unbelievable and unpredictable twists to the point that now i am literally fearing who, after losing so many of our beloved protagonists, will be up next. just a fantastic show that i hope will continue for a long time and that i wish did non have such a broad hiatus between seasons."
2019-05-21,sumayyajames,Can't believe it's over,10,"i am griefstricken this series has finished, i've never felt so emotionally invested in a series before, i feel i know all the characters so well, like family members. i didn't want khaleesi to die, i wanted jon to rule beside her, but that's got, never does what you want and that's why we were all hooked."
2020-06-11,aminmcfc,Best Tv serie ever however the end was not suitable,10,"6 seasons love , enjoy , excitement and surprise. not compare to any series."
2018-09-08,hannanimran,GOT is the best,5,game of throne is best tv series in warfare category
2020-07-18,jonnystaz,I tried so hard to like it...,10,after hearing so much fuss about this programme i sat down and eagerly watched it.i couldn't even make it to the end of the first episode.
2015-07-27,alexalfarkh1,This show will go down in history as the best,10,"what can you say about this show, it has everything your looking for in a major television series. the story is fantastic and the characters even better. one thing that you will surely love about this show is that it is one of the few that stay true to the books it is based off of, i mean the books had to have been good for them to make a television show off of it, and they were right the books were good, and i think the writer knew that so they stayed true to the story that the fans already fell in love with, and that why i believe this tv show has had so much success and will in the future. this isn't like these other shows you see where the creators and producers of the show think that their ideas are top notch and change an already amazing story, no when hbo picked up this show they knew the potential, brilliance and overall great story telling."
2020-10-20,abhinashchaudhary,Greatest let down in the history of television.,10,many people complain about the last season but things started going wrong long time before that. tone of the series started to change right around the time when john snow was brought back to life. they started to please people by showing good people win. their people pleasing strategy went against all the things that this series stood for. and i don't even like to talk about how they ruined tyrion's character. i think the writers went totally ahead of themselves after the success they got in initial seasons. could have been the greatest thing in television history and people would have remembered this series for generations but........

2015-08-11,mikeantonie,The most BORING and overrated show of all time! NOTHING compared to the superior Breaking Bad,10,"when i first heard about this show i was very excited to see how magnificent it was...wrong!!! i am a huge breaking bad fan, and i was deeply disappointed when i saw that game of thrones had the same rating as breaking bad. why in gods name would game of thrones have the same rating as breaking bad!!! game of thrones has no action, let me guess... throwing a kid off a castle is action... there is no action in that at all. let me continue... oh my god!!! the acting!! hahaha that must be a joke. breaking bad actors have eight more emmys for better acting than game of thrones does. last time i checked eight is greater than zero. anna gun the wife of walter white has the exact same emmys as peter dinklage... game of thrones best and favorite actor. better acting... ya right!!! better storyline... hahahaha! a chemistry teacher with terminal lung cancer makes methanphetamine in order to provide for his family is a way better storyline than 7 noble kingdoms use pornography in order to intrigue the viewers into watching the show. and dragons... what the heck is wrong with the fans!!!.. are you what 3 years old!!! might as well put some tinker bell in that show too to make more people want to watch the show more!!!... ""game of thrones is sooooo much better than breaking bad"" ya right!!!. breaking bad was nominated twice for being the best best drama series... twice!!! breaking bads main actor bryan cranston has five emmys, aaron paul has three emmys and anna gunn has 1 emmy and all you have on game of thrones is peter dinklage with only one i mean only one emmy. game of thrones will never be as superior as breaking bad. game of thrones=inferior"
2015-09-18,whatisagoodfilm,A must-watch series,9,"some may think that the fame of the game of thrones series is just a matter of trend, but it most definitely is not.adapted from george r r martin's book series ""a song of ice and fire"", i believe the popularity of the game of thrones series comes from a brilliant adaptation. the characters are all played by great actors, and unlike so many other series today, the characters are not ""one,dimensional"" - they all have their own battles and their own problems, not to mention their own personalities. steady character growth is also something too rarely seen and which has been successfully executed here, very notable on characters such as khalessi played by emilia clarke or jon snow played by kit harrington. david benioff and d.b. weiss were not miserable when it came to placing plot twists and character deaths in episodes, unlike other tv shows such as the walking dead where it seems that only the first and last episode of a season needs to be exciting while the rest are as average as they can be. every episode of game of thrones reveals new and exciting information which makes every episode worth while."
2019-05-14,vikramaditya-47737,Waste of time...,10,"not worth the wait very very disappointing..all main character has no story line.. everything is just to creat hype nothing else... can't believe this could end like this... not worth the wait very very disappointing..all main character has no story line.. everything is just to creat hype nothing else... can't believe this could end like this...
not worth the wait very very disappointing..all main character has no story line.. everything is just to creat hype nothing else... can't believe this could end like this"
2015-10-12,aaymanmadred,Excellent adaptation.,10,"*first of all, i am a huge fan of the books, and i find it exhilarating to see a show that is so close to what i made in my mind while reading it.i see some of the reviews are complaining about the sex and violence, to me that is like going to a restaurant, order a steak and complain about getting meat..they keep true to the epically written book, and they depict the characters in an excellent way.with a few exceptions i would say they have made what will be an epic show here, and i would really hope that they continue for all the books"
2021-08-05,gdocter,GoT is the world without enlightenment,10,"what makes this fantasy series so realistic is that at times the world seems to be as it is in got.how often in history are kingdoms ruled by fear and loyalty and is love what you feel only for your nearest and dearest. for so many, death, monsters and black magic has seemed to be hidden around every corner. honesty, passion and ideals are dangerous. revenge is sweet.to me one of the most impressive moments was in season 1, in which i expected tyrion lannister to survive a trial by using his wits, which 100% certainly would have been the case if the rules of today's western storytelling had been followed. but he didn't, and i then i realized that the real myth may be that wits win trials."
2018-09-16,koenig-oskar,"Season 7 is below average television with an insanely high budget, nothing more.",10,"take away the huge amount of money that went into making the last season and there is nothing left. seasons 1,6 had depth, character studies, great dialogues and a world that was alive. season 7 has expensive spectacle that is losely tied together by some quickly hashed plot.
also, what happened in costume design? it seems everyone is wearing super hero costumes in s7. with the black, tightly fitting costumes everyone is wearing now for weeks at a time. in the earlier seasons the characters wore realistic looking armour, different gowns and doublets"
2019-05-20,thesimpx,D&D.,10,"game of thrones, in other words the best t.v show ever until d&d gone mad. they threw away characters development, logical events leading up to other logical events, well written dialogues, and many separated pov characters just to focus on three characters. but hay all thanks for the adaptation, thanks to an amazing staff and crew for everything done. farewell got <3."
2019-05-17,meganwolf,PLEASE REBOOT THE LAST SEASON. SAVE THE SHOW,10,"this show is incredible and it's fantastic. just the last season.... what the damn hell?apparently hbo wanted like 12,14 seasons for this and i think they were really onto something. because condescending everything into this one not great season just isn't working for me. just scrap it and move on with the story pretty please"
2019-05-20,rajatbgupta,The Song of Ice & Fire!!!,9,"wow! what do i say about got! simply the best show ever! season 1 to season 7 is simply breathtaking! great character building, storyline, acting, action ..... list goes on and on ..... saddened at the way it ended but i would have never wanted this to end ...... i was tempted to take off one star due to season 8 but got has given me far more beautiful memories, a weak season 8 can't spoil it all! i hope it is remembered for all the great stuff prior to the last season!!!
still for me the greatest show of all time!!!"
2019-05-23,ezrabridgersf,It was amazing show,8,"it was amazing show. i've watched it may be 6,7 times. the finals season ruined everything. the end is may be the most important part of a story and d&d made it complete mess. now i don't have the desire to re-watch it ever again. i will follow tightly the books of martin. i hope that the prequels will be much better. i feel betrayed and humiliated by d&d. that's the truth. i am not one of the people who complain that it did not end the way the wanted. i am from the people who complain for the rushed scenario and many plot holes which followed inevitably."
2019-09-22,smartkhi,"It was perfect in every way, until...",10,"this show would have been a masterpiece. but they killed the fans in the last season. it's a damn shame! there's no divine justice, you dumb c***."

2016-01-10,dmunro-69260,This show sucks,10,i have seen a lot of good shows and a lot of bad shows. i do not think that i have ever seen a show this bad. i tried to watch the first season and it was awful. very stupid and boring. i continued to watch it because i heard so much good things about it but i just could not get myself to get to the fifth episode. i am personally not a fan of shows like this but it looked cool but a complete disappointment all around a terrible show. the only good part is the sex and the boobs if that stuff was not in the show then this show would have never been as popular all people want to see is emilia clarkes boobs. this show is worse than any show i could think of. also the dwarf is pretty coo also
2019-05-20,xuroshvili,Thank you for 7 great seasons !,4,"i have just watched the last episode of deason 8.... why ? why have you ruined my fav tv show ? why did u do that?i have never rated any episode of got less than 10 , until season 8.100% dissapointed and angry !i dont think this tv show deserves higher than 9.0 any more...congrats hbo and d&d u made me hate season 8"
2018-01-08,stefanmallows,A Fantastic Series From Start to Finish,10,"what. a. show. arguably the defining television show of the last decade, game of thrones deserves every accolade it receives. focusing on the rivalry and feudal affairs of the great houses of stark, lannister, baratheon and targaryen, this show is both captivating for its action,packed set pieces and fit to bursting with emotional depth and intrigue. a five star show from beginning to end, the cinematic-styled action pieces are unrivalled in their epic nature, in comparison to other television shows of this moment. characters are well-defined and explored in an interesting and compelling way, keeping you guessing as to which avenue they will ultimately take, and whose side they are really on. characters are evolved, storylines take unexpected twists and turns, and heroes are never, ever safe. this series is one that should not be missed. once you start it, you'll be hooked and begging for more."
2020-01-14,jhood-77363,Missing The End Game,10,greatest show ever written for tv for six seasons. good show for one season. different show all together for final season.....this show was a 10 to me up until the final season.

2016-01-29,rollinitiativeplus,Poor,10,"the following is just my opinion and should not be misconstrued as fact.""when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die"" game of thrones""forget the promise of progress and understanding. for in the the grim dark future there is only war."" warhammer 40kin my opinion got is a rehash of too many authors hard work. i acknowledge that nothing is new or original but i feel that for got he does not even attempt to be so. one of the biggest mistakes i made was to read bulfinchs mythology around the same time as got, at times i was certain i was reading the same story.if you enjoyed the character deaths in got i'd highly recommend reading(if you're able) dan abnetts warhammer 40k novels. character deaths have meaning while at the same time show the waste of war and how it can strike anyone randomly, they move the plot forward without being dwelt upon too much but are not just glossed over.to close this scattered collection of thoughts i'll give an example of one of the largest failings in got, the red wedding. while the lead up to the action is ham,fisted and unbelievable the event itself is fine. my gripe is that the ""rules of hospitality"" that had been important up to that point are thrown away to show walders cunning. however!!! this oh so important traditional rule of not harming someone that takes ""your meat and mead"" bears no repercussions when broken. anyway, just my opinion and i apologize for being all over this place with my thoughts. i suppose i should also mention i've watched all the current seasons and have read all of the books in the series up to this date."

2019-03-06,vishekssem,The writing of Game of Thrones is just phenomenal.,10,"do not believe any of those negative reviews. game of thrones is the best tv,series ever.
'game of thrones' may belong to the 'fantasy' genre, but the world of westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. of course, that was all already there in the books - but translating that so perfectly to a tv-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement."

anyway we can not deny the greatness of such a show
a greatness of such characters ...
characters we loved we hated we loved to hate <3
even if the ending is not pleasing everyone
this is the greatest show ever"
2019-05-20,dulsararanathunga,Awesome 😍👌🏻,10,"i gave 10 out of 10 before the season 8 aires. after watching 4th and 5th episodes in season 8, i had a doubt about it because they were little bit disappointing but however they managed to end it well. so i keep my ratings and invite all of you to watch it."
2019-05-27,uzaycetin-32479,"4 Masterpiece Seasons, 2 Great Seasons, 1 Mediocore Season, 1 Bad Season (THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)",4,"this is the chronologic summary of got. before starting the review, i had to say this: this is one of the best tv series of the all time. even we got very bad season 8, i can still consider this series as a masterpiece thanks to first 6 season. so let me categorize got for a better review.first four season : there is nothing to say here. first four season are all masterpiece. even they have mistakes, they are negligible. i can give it 10 easily.highlighted scenes:character deaths(especially ned stark and oberyn martell), king's landing scenes, the wall sceneshighlighted episodes: winter is coming(s1 e1), baelor(s1 e9),blackwater(s2 e9),valar morghulis(s2 e10), and now his watch is ended(s3 e4),the rains of castamere(s3 e9),the lion and the rose(s4 e2),the laws of gods and men(s4 e6),the mountain and the viper(s4 e8),the watchers on the wall(s4 e9),the children(s4 e10)season 5:
it is a very decent season but i can't put this season along 4 masterpiece seasons. because this season is where the mistakes can take as a problem. unbowed, unbent, unbroken(s5 e6) is easily the worst episode of first five seasons and in this season, some characters (like stannis) lost their momentum.
but in the end it is still fun to watch. it is 9 out of 10 season for me.highlighted scenes: walkers vs jon snow and friends, death of stannis, walk of atonementhighlighted episodes:hardhome(s5 e8),the dance of dragons(s5 e9),mother's mercy(s5 e10)season 6:
for me it is the best got season. so why didn't i put this along first four season? even though it has best episodes of got it is not homogen like ffs. some episodes are ok/good ( like no one(s6 e8) ) some episodes are masterpiece. character motivations, cinematography, twists and all the things you like about got is hit the top. so i am giving this season 9.7.highlighted scenes: hodor's death, battle of the b*stards, jon snow's family, cersie sits the thronehighlighted episodes: home(s6 e2), book of the stranger(s6 e4), the door (s6 e5), battle of the b*stards (s6 e9), the winds of winter (s6 e10)(best episode for me)season 7:
from here i am going to talk about bad things mostly because it is easier. first of all if we got a decent season 8, it would be the worst season. after ""almost perfect"" season i didn't expect this. i thought having a less episode season is great for getting a bigger wars, important scenes etc. but we didn't get it. i said ""some characters lost their momentum"" in season 5 review but in this season some characters (like daenerys targaryen and jon snow) completely lost me and this season also have another problem: time jumps. it took 30 minutes to go another island from far away. but is this season trash? no. it has very well thinked moments and action scenes are actually very good. but overall it is mediocore. sadly this is 7.0 season for me.highlighted scenes: daenerys targaryen vs lannister army, night king kills dragon, jon snow and daenerys targaryen meets, behind the wall crew unites.highlighted episodes:the spoils of war (s7 e4), eastwatch(s7 e5)season 8:
i don't want to talk about it but i have to. let start with what is good: tyrion lannister. i always loved tyrion but in this season he shines. he shows us how good can he act and he use his mind like samwell tarly not like jon snow(thanks to d&d). and the second thing is sansa for same reasons. so what is bad? almost everything else. jon snow and daenerys targaryen becomes most cheesy characters not in the series but in all tv series i watched. character conclusions are not satisfying(mostly). diologs like ""she is my queen."" is very boring and bad after hearing them a lot. daenerys targaryen, jaime, cersie, night king's deaths are not good written. if we compare with season 6, death scenes are far from effectiveness. last thing i want to mention is why they ""choose"" bran as a king in the ""game of thrones""? in sum, this is a very disappointing and bad season for great tv series. i think this is 5.0 out of 10.highlighted scenes: all tyrion and sansa stark scenes, king's landing's fall, cleganebowl, dynamic between arya and the hound, monocamera shots from the streets (fall of king's landing)highlighted episode: (i know people are angry about this episode but i think it a very decent episode) the bells (s8 e5)
this was my review about got. like i said it is a very decent tv series with bad finale. but with season 8 he lost ""best tv series off all time"" awards to breaking bad. i hope spin,off's don't suck."
2016-03-20,aryangeneral,The Greatest TV Series Of All Time !!!,10,"this tv series is undoubtedly the greats tv series of all time!! and it is no wonder that after 5 years, it is still considered the best tv series and top rated . the movie has a great and deeply created story , the characters are perfectly picked and the movie is almost completely without any flaw . perfect characters, perfect story , perfect pace , and so full of contents that they literally trim so many parts of the story to be able to put each series in 10 episodes, most definitely the best between all the tv series and movies, in music , in graphical scenery , and in pathology of each character . the movie is based on a very strong story which can support more than 50 episodes in a single season . and just as its name suggests, it is the crown jewel of all the tv series in history of cinema ! definitely rated 10 (100/100 , any fewer rate would be a real injustice to the greatest movie of all time, which it is) in my list of ten best tv series of all time, the game of thrones as expected sits on the top of it all, the list is as follows: 1. game of thrones2. westworld3. breaking bad4. black sails5. vikings6. expanse7. revolution8. true detective9. the outsiders10. the leftoversif you haven't started these tv shows yet, then you should start right now, otherwise you would lose your would've been greatest moments of your life ."

2019-05-22,tomb-65575,Best Show Ever!! (Tied with Breaking Bad),10,"no spoilers here!this tv series tells the story of noble and non,noble families and people in a fictional land at a time that can or should be considered medieval. most of the characters are scheming one way or another to become the king or queen of the fictional land called westeros. the show stands out for its nudity, violence, cgi, historical accuracies, motifs, complex storylines, surprises, and ambiguous antagonists and protagonists. and the person who ends up on the throne is the greatest schemer of them all! simply, it's as good as it gets until the people who know how to do it better do it better!this tv series is also based off of george r.r. martin's ""a song of ice and fire"" book series."
2017-01-19,einavsavion,my life,10,"this tv series is magnificent! i read a book and i must say that a game of thrones is one of the best books i've read. so when i first heard that hbo will do a series on the this book i was thrilled but i was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. but i must say that i was wrong and that the series is better than i thought it would be. much better! while i watched the first episode i had the same excitement as the time when i first read the book. hbo has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. sean bean was born for the role of eddard stark. costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. actors are perfect for the role they play in the series. for me the biggest surprise of the series i figure daenerys targaryen. emilia clarke actress who plays daenerys targaryen is more beautiful than i imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book. the wall is a lot different than i had imagined, but in a good way. the series revolves around eddard stark and his family. he has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. eddard stark is ruler of the north and close friend of king robert who needs his help in ruling the seven kingdoms.the seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since king robert took the throne. but nothing is ever as it seems. within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. to the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten."
2019-05-20,androdrisler,Review after watching the finale.,10,they ruined the show. the characters... the ending... fan expectations... the utter dissapoinment is that everyone got something good expect the ones who deserved it... they illogicaly ended it and messed up characters... thats all.
2019-05-16,hamooood-79169,EPIC,10,"well, what did you expect from a dragon? she was a dragon and because of that she won the war, of course i didn't like that she had burnt all these people but that what we like about the show that always what we dont expect happens. missandei:""dracarys"""
2019-02-28,anilkvrma,Love the show,8,"i really love the show, i have been watched this 5,6 time all of season's episodes, really like it."
2021-09-10,mortazajaz,A little reminder,10,"for those who forgot why the last season received such a bad rating, i just wanted to remind that, jon snow true identity was the legendary aegon targeryan, and it didn't mean anything at the ending!thanks a lot. david benioff and d. b. weiss."
2016-05-14,yohan-54024,Not that perfect,10,"my review is based on the seasons 1 to 4.this review contains spoilers !i used to heard about game of thrones success but never had time to watch it so one day i decided to go ahead and watch the 1st season.first of all let's talk about the 1st season, it was really boring, a story line about a kid that falls from a building....i was like wow what a story line...(ironic).i gave this show a last chance and i thought there would be some kind of big change or a boost in the story line with the season 2 so i started to watch the first episodes and unfortunately i was still disappointed with this show. the story line is mediocre, no change with the 1st season i wondered myself how the hell can be this tv show so popular, there's no suspense at all, the story is very slow to start, i hoped to see wars but nothing about it except in the 2nd or 3rd season when stannis baratheon attempted to assault the king's landing (only good moment of the show).in brief this show deals with the political and government world but from the ancient age including treasons, wedding conspiracies and killings..i watch this show only when i have time to waste."
2016-06-04,ben_brwn,"Amazing storytelling, a harsh reality and an excellent adaptation of the books",10,"this show is absolutely stunning, hbo has completely captured the essence of george r.r. martins books, a song of ice and fire, and turned it into a fascinating on,screen perception.the reason this series is so captivating is because its never clear what will happen in each episode to come along with the absolute genius storytelling. before you know it, you see your favorite characters killed off or plotted against in a manner which leaves the viewer shocked and keeps them itching for more, no-one is safe at any point during the series bringing a harsh but true reality to the show, to draw a quote 'when you play the game of thrones you win or you die'.the first few episodes will be confusing for those unfamiliar to the series and may put them off from continuing to watch, but if you stick through it and keep watching there will come a point in the first season where the show clicks with you and causes you binge watch the entire series up until the point when you've caught up with where the show currently is and then on after to look forward to each new installment every week.to summarize, with the series intelligent plot lines and unpredictability i would strongly recommend to anyone.a solid 10/10"
2019-04-16,billyjoelancer,Disappointing ending,8,books were great while they lasted. show was great while it followed original story. starting from episode 6 season 7 it lost everything what made this story/show great.
2019-05-22,rahatamna,WORST ENDING IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION!,1,"first 6 seasons were fantastic but after that everything went south and especially season 8 was the worst! it was rushed and i could not make any emotional connection with any of the characters. simply put, it was bland! the ending was so bad that it feels like you wasted your precious 10 years for nothing!"
2018-08-23,yashaswisingh,This SHOW knows no BOUNDS!,5,"there is a common stereotype which goes with tv shows pertaining to ancient times, having dragons and warriors. they are supposed to be monotonous with the general public. i too had my speculations and following the trend never really watched these kinds of shows.game of thrones , a fantasy drama series, set in an early landscape of england, where people waged war for a throne, was no different to me. it had kings wearing oversized rugs, their queens glistening in golden gowns and the ever so obedient daughters, the sons - playing and practicing with swords: the first episode seemed like a direct inference to the stereotype we discussed before. it wasn't to be though, and somehow i continued.game of thrones is an experience which i feel everyone should be a part of. it crosses boundaries of suspense in a way you can never imagine, it gives you endings worse than goosebumps, there are fiery speeches, immaculate acting, perfect direction and possibly one of the best stories you will ever come across. the show runs on the idea of anything can happen in a very literal sense. and that is not an easy feat.it's something i'd recommend to any person, irrespective of their age or gender. must watch!"
2019-06-07,elasevinc,Zero points should be available as a rating..!,10,"worst tv show ever because of the ending... just stay away, don't watch and end up like me, feeling kicked in your stomach after the finale..! can't believe i put eight years of my life in this xxxx"
2019-05-15,arhanover,What's the problem?,10,"i don't understand why everyone is so upset about season 8 (especially episode 5). because daenerys snapped? this all makes perfect sense. she found out jon was the true heir and she knew the people loved him. she lost jon, she lost missandei, she lost her claim to the iron throne. jon has the better claim. she only has one way to show her power now, through fear. this is game of thrones people!!! nothing happens the way we want. it's unpredictable. that's what's always made the show so amazing. i just really don't get the hate."
2018-05-29,dsw-81447,Season 1-4 great after that not so much,10,"seasons 1,4 were great and had great writing but after that the show just became a mess with bad writing"
2017-10-26,eennzzoo,Excelente series,10,"game of thrones's comeback was awesome, amazing plots, awesome characters and again awesome dialogue and writing, dan weiss and benioff do some nice works on converging the story,lines and i am okay with it, no way they would squish 1000 pages of a book in 10 hours, they do a fine work with what they can, and got is their gold mine. wish a better season than the last one."
2019-10-15,jairam-07344,1 less due to the final episode,9,"this has been a wonderful tv show since the first season and has always outnumbered any other tv show in feel, experience, creativity and graphics.the last season especially the last episode was a piece of crap which spoilt the ending of such great story line. it is definitely a must watch for anyone who like lord of the rings."
2019-05-21,ameermahdimayali,It the best tv show ever,10,it the best tv show ever .it have a kind of emotion so i like it
2020-02-17,frenchpatrick,A perfect show that derails sadly,10,"the first half of this beautifully written and acted show is perfect, every little thing is perfect. and yet, half way through the series, after the best season, season 4, the show does a 90 degree turn and becomes just pretty good. seasons 5 and 6 are fine, they have some amazing episodes, but many forgettable plot threads, some of which are downright stupid. then the show does a complete 180 from season 4 and becomes arguably the worst show on hbo, the production value is amazing as always, but seasons 7 and 8 are downright despicably awful, everything about them are just stupid and not well thought out, everything is forced and everything is cringe. the acting is still amazing, in fact come to think of it, every aspect is still spectacular, but the most important aspect is terrible, the writing. duck d&d for ruining this shows massive potential"
2019-05-14,nazlikiris,Good gone to bad,1,"i'll give 10 just for season 1,2,3,4,5 and 6; the other season are act like we are fool"

2019-05-21,abdulrahman-84389,Legendary,1,in my opinion it's the second best tv show ever made but the two fainal seasons was disappointing especially the fainal one but it does still a legendary show
2019-05-19,guyonvanoers,An amazing series with a ridiculous conclusion,10,"if you'd ask me a few years ago what i'd rate got i would've instantly said 10 stars. but after the mediocre season 7 and horrifying season 8 i can't give it more than 9 stars. season 8 just threw all of the past seasons' character development and story out of the window in order to finish the series. d&d really proved they're incompetent writers with this season, as soon as they ran out of books the show has been going down in quality."
2019-05-20,danielcoombs001,For Balance,10,"i was slightly disappointed with the ending but not overly so as some are. the score needed balencing out a little , 4.5/10 at the time of writing this is extreme. overall a 6.5/10 rating for me."
2021-01-19,aflask,"Amazing start, horrible ending.",10,"the first 4 seasons are honestly some of the best in television. those post continue to decrease in incredible fashion. the last season is lackluster, disappointing, and overall a slap in the face to devoted fans. 9/10 for first 4/5 seasons."
2016-09-19,vancemunsen,"wow, what a show.",10,"where do i start? what an epic show... the sets, the actors and the overall production. im not one to be impressed easily but this is a great show. the suspense keeps building in each episode and you know the payoff will be worth it in the end. favourite character? too many to choose from. i also enjoy the gory side of things and this ticks that box for this fella. i truly hope it keeps being made but shudder to think of the actual cost for each episode. as i mentioned the sets are truly epic. the costumes are first class and you really feel as though you are back in time. maybe too many wines for me when i watch it but i feel like a kid again. and yes, i have bought my share of merchandise."
2021-03-13,gabisenk,A once best series ruined,10,"not at fault of the writers but of the original writer g.r.r masrtin and also the producers of this show,what is about this show that i liked? everything. the story, the medieval fantasy setting, the fact that it also resembled the dark medieval history that our ancestors lived through. wow, this show was such an eye opener need i tell you?medieval times were hard on the individual and if you want to know why game of thrones will fill you on this knowledge.but as a fantasy series. it fell short. this is because it's good at the beginning but it didn't know how to end.what is the fault pf the last 2 seasons? well the 2 infamous producers and g.r.r martin are both to blame here.you see? this series was picked up on with a big budget while only the first 4 books were written. the fifth was finished during the production of 2nd season. not big alarms there right? harry potter movies were produced 2 titles behind their original adaptation....you were. wrong. one thing is harry potter and one thing is heavy fantasy genre.game of thrones is the exact example of what would be an honest adaptation to all the good fantasy books out there if they would be done right. with the other one being lord of the rings. that's right. the only 2 titles with right adaptation are these two.but the sad thing is... the material didn't live long enough. game of thrones is an accurate adaptation of the books but only the first 4 seasons. the next one being chaotic, eyebrow raising and just weird in general.there are good parts about the last 4 seasons but they just don't match the original writing and honest to god adaptation of the first 3 books.i recommend watching only the first 4 seasons and start on reading the books. maybe good old g.r.r will outlive his writing on his final book. however i will doubt this. he will be like mozart. forever an unfinished piece. but the first 4 seasons. they are worth watching. skip the other ones please. thank you"

2016-10-13,s-36938,A show that has sadly lost it's flair.,9,"game of thrones has always had it's highs and lows in terms of quality.the earlier seasons (1,2,3,4) had a fantastic story, interesting characters and great acting. it was quite an engrossing show and was my favourite show at the time. yes it had it's flaws, there were some characters that got thrown away too quickly and there were plot holes that never got covered, this never tarnished my overall experience though.it's shame that the last two seasons have not been up to standards, it's still an enjoyable show, but it's quality has dropped drastically. the flaws are more noticeable now, with characters getting introduced but getting hardly any development and getting dropped like flies with no explanation. another problem is the pacing, some story lines are hardly moving forward and others are getting rushed. original rating: 9/10 current rating: 6/10"
2019-05-20,naseemshookt,Best show ever,10,"it's the beast show ever and it always will be . it's unexpected and very excited
every body should see this masterpiece"
2016-10-18,rebeccaswan-26443,A breathtaking fantasy drama with some of the most complex and captivating characters on TV,8,"game of thrones is certainly not a show for the light,hearted. as most know, this show is based on a series of books and this review is for those who haven't read them. what make this show the third highest rated tv show of all time on imdb are numerous reasons: the plot for instance, is heavy on mystery, interconnections between various characters and massively impactful character development. despite being something like a medieval fantasy, this show has characters going through conflicts that can be seen in the real world, in this era- the stigma faced by people with physical disabilities, being painted falsely because your opinions don't match with those of the popular, learning that trust is a very fragile thing...and the like. it is very hard to write a review without spoilers for a show with such an extensive and engaging plot. it does contain scenes of heavy violence and nudity (albeit as the seasons progress, the nudity decreases and violence increases) but unlike the misconception of many- ""oh, that show is only watched so much for its obscene scenes""- the show is so, so much more. with excellent cinematography, characters who will morally affect your own thinking, unforgettable lines and themes- game of thrones is a treat for those who are smart and mature enough to get exactly what the show tries to convey. it may not appeal to some, however, mainly because its story is vast and contains numerous characters- it will be hard to follow, but totally worth it if your mind's sharp enough!"
2019-12-29,sirireheart,"Game of Thrones, Goes from Fantastic to Terrible, cutting out elements from the book",10,"short review. game of thrones, goes from fantastic to terrible because cut material in the book, simplified the complexity of the song of ice and fire world and had some very poor writing and as seasons went on reduced the amount of episodes thus rushing or cutting plot,lines. many of the non-book canon that was wrote for the tv series was terrible and flawed.character development based on book, casting for characters, costume/scene design were all fantastic, the fault of this series lies as stated above, rushed, simplified story-line. poor writing outside of the books."
2017-08-21,abbastriplefive,great drama for thrones,9,"it is one of the most entertaining tv series. dragon is a major advantage. season 7 is extraordinary. massive scenes are very less. but some massive scenes give big impact like joffrey's dead, big blast and every dragon scene. at the same time characters usage is awesome like ned stark, tyrion, jon , khaleesi, arya stark and that old lady (tell cercei it's me)."

2019-05-07,aleeen-01090,The Best Show ever Now and Always .,10,"i don't know why people got angry from last season, but it always is and will always be the best, last season was good but the way of killing the night king is bad , but it not deserve 6 rating and a lot of attack !!"
2021-08-18,keenanstarr,Maybe I Missed Something...,10,"i just rewatched the entire series.it was glorious.everybody is criticizing the last season or the last episode, but why?how should it have ended? all the stark children around the fireplace sipping ale and reminiscing about ned?the show was fantastic from beginning to end. the same writers put the same effort into every single episode. nothing was left out.everybody had horrible things happen to them throughout the series so you didn't think it was going to be a fairytale ending did you? everyone came together to defeat the white walkers then went to live their own lives.i'm just not sure what people were expecting."
2019-05-08,pauljamilkowski-24355,"1 🌟, because of what the show became.",2,"there couldn't be a more gaping hole between the writing of the show in the early seasons vs after the show writers had to do their job when running out of source material from the book. this show was the highlight of my week before season 7, and up until that point my excitement already began to fade as the show started catering to fan service, subverting plot expectations for no other purpose than just that, and making events that shouldn't be possible, possible, and expecting us not to notice. themes, foreshadowing, and plot setups that were planted for years are thrown out the window. what made the show so great is now gone as the final season wraps up in one fell swoop of disappointment."
2018-10-19,gill_lamb,Didn't think I'd like it,10,this is the best thing i've ever watched. watch it is all i can say!!
2019-08-05,badams-30188,Still the greatest show of all times,6,"game of thrones changed television in a time where television isn't that great anymore! i agree that the final season was disappointing but still the series has the best storyline and acting ever + the series took high risks by surpassing 5 seasons.
breaking bad for example was already getting boring in season 5.
the fans who hate got these days would of loved to see 15 seasons."
2017-10-10,christopherchettiar,Greatest Show ever,4,"game of thrones created by george r. r. martin's series of fantasy novels. the novel itself was the best seller and loved by everyone. george r. r. martin did not stop by just the book. a tv show has started in 2011 by hbo. television series created by david benioff and d. b. weiss. the game of thrones was hit the rating from the first season the show is been growing more and more as the season is building. the massive adventure,cool action and awesome character build. game of thrones is now the most viewed and most popular show ever."
2017-05-29,glockkaty,One of the best shows ever!,10,"i don't even know where to begin with this review, but everything about game of thrones is awesome. the actors themselves are well cast (for the most part), their acting is tremendous, the plot always keeps you on your toes, and it really makes you forget that none of it is real. the sets are fantastic and i'm hoping to visit some of the filming locations in ireland next month.a lot of people (mostly females) tend to complain about the nudity throughout the show, but in reality, the show actually dials it back compared to the books. it keeps it interesting, in my opinion. i remember really liking this show during season 1 because i was really trying to predict what all was going to happen. then episode 9, ""baelor"" happened and my love for the show was cemented. this show keeps you on your toes because nobody is safe in westeros. not having read the books before the show, i thought sean bean (ned) was the main character of the show. well, that quickly changed in season 1, episode 9, which i will always remember my reaction. while some seasons move slower than others, overall the plot is very well paced (with the exception of daenerys, don't even get me started). this show has so many surprises in store (cersei and jaime in the first episode, red wedding, r+l=j, hodor's story, sons of the harpy, purple wedding, trial by combat, jon snow and the nights watch, etc.)tyrion is by far my favorite character. peter dinklage's acting is amazing, he's the right balance between knowledgeable, fair, kind, and witty. jon snow is a close second in my book. i know this review was a bit all over the place, but i just love this show so much and wanted to strongly encourage everybody to give it a fair shot. you may be confused for a bit because there are so many names to remember (and all strange names at that), but once you get past that it's worth it! give it a chance and you will not be disappointed!"
2018-11-19,wtomererel,Perfect with its own imperfections,10,i didnt watch this till the beginning of season 6 but boy i made a mistake. i watched this show 4 times now and i read all the books. this show is the gamechanger.
2019-05-13,spilladappadan,BEST THING I HAVE SEEN ON TV EVEN WITH THE LAST SEASON,10,nothing has ever come close to this series. don't be upset that it's finishing up. giving bitter bad reviews about the last season because you don't want this masterpiece of a series to end is just bad taste. i will never see anything like this again. it got to all of my emotions and nothing on tv has ever done that before. thank you to all the cast and staff of the show. i am glad i am alive to witness this spectacular astonishing show. i will miss it to but i won't be bitter i will be happy that something made me get away from the reality of this world. got you got me 🖤
2020-09-22,perez-62862,A great adaptation of a wonderful series of books that fell apart,10,avoid the last season and wait for the book! the story falls apart and there are too many inconclusive storylines which unfortunately ruins the prior seasons!
2019-01-19,shubhamtripathi-30346,A magnificent series nearly full of all emotions one may think of,8,the storyline has been carved absolutely delicious and what else can you can expect from a series and whatever expectations you may have can turn out to be totally different within seconds.
2021-09-07,mortenbyrud,Everything I want in a tv series,10,this tv series is so damn good. it's fun and exciting through all of the seasons. the only negatives are they should have brought more over from the books. all seasons are so perfect except the last one.

2017-03-01,nmussa-41049,Perfection,2,"for me game of thrones is the number one tv show currently. everything about it is beyond perfect. the cast, costume, plot, animation and so on. i can't say enough about the cast like literally everyone is perfect and i can't pick my favorite. from all the episode battle of bastards was amazing. i was so happy to see the bastard ramsay to get what he deserved. i haven't had any show that excites me as this show. i wish it had more episodes in a season and i could watch it more before the big break. i don't get enough of it. i hope it doesn't end soon and there are many many more episodes to come."
2019-05-28,faheemsamiki,A great series with a weak ending,9,"honestly speaking, this was one of the series i've always avoided as i'm not a big fan of the 'war' theme. but to my surprise i actually loved the plot. though there were few scenes which felt too much of a drag, the deceitful nature and the downfall of a person when he/she wants more and more is beautifully highlighted. i felt daenerys was an over,rated character (personal opinion) and thought sansa stark was useless except for 'battle of the bastards'. really loved arya stark's, tyrion lannister, jon snow and jaimie lannister's storyline. lena headey made complete justice to cersei's character.
the only thing i loved from the final season was the battle against the night king and arya stark's role in it. apart from that, i just felt that the episodes were too long and pointless.
the ending of the game of thrones was pointless but still managed to give me goosebumps. all the remaining starks getting what they always wanted was great."
2019-12-26,tamsinking,Unbeatable,9,best thing thats ever been on the big or small screen. hands down.... its literally had me climbing over my sofa with tension. final season included. i would love to see something come even close to how good this was...
2019-05-23,joe-47695,Still 10,1,even though i was disappointed with season 8 that doesn't mean the other 7 series weren't amazing so it still gets 10 from me even if it is slightly tainted
2019-05-14,ljkrohelski-27757,"Exceptional, Gold Standard",9,"there is only so much television that is in this area. thrones is up there with the best of them. a few seasons are a bit better than others but all 8 are fantastic in their own way. the character development, plot, cinematography, music, all top class. going to be hard to find a new show to replace this masterpiece."
2019-08-10,pikachu-67003,"If not the best, then one of the best shows I have ever seen",2,"season 1,6: perfectly written, amazing seasons season 7: decent writing, enjoyable
season 8: we don't talk about that hereso speaking as a viewer who mostly watched superheroes, and the action genre, watching got was very different for me, but however i enjoyed this show, and loved every single episode (excluding most of s8). it was different to most things i watch but surprisingly, got was the best experience for me in tv, and i just loved to go on the journey with each character (even though i started and finished in 2019 xd). but honestly speaking, this is not a show you would want to miss, season 8 definitely did ruin this show, but this has to be a must-watch for the first seven amazing seasons.this show literally had the best ensemble cast in tv, in my opinion, with emilia clarke, kit harrington, sophie turner, maise williams, sean bean and my favourite- peter dinklage, being the most notable.finally, just to talk about the visuals, music and that kind of stuff:
visual fx: the company who does the vfx for got, from the dragons to the blood and gore, is on point, and just very realistic. overall adds up to a more realistic atmosphere and gives it that sense of being set 1000's of years ago.music/score: ramin djawadi is a bloody legend for what he has cooked up throughout the seasons. the intro theme he made is by far the most catchy theme (along with the theme of arrow), and his scores as well. if you want a teaser as to how amazing his music is, just check out: light of the seven, rains of castamere and the north remembers on youtube.intro: 11/10honestly, s8 is a dissapointment, but do not let that sound like it makes the whole show not worth watching, because it really is due to the rest of the seasons. i even find myself occasionally re-watching some scenes on yt lol."
2019-05-16,q-64185,GOT,10,"even though last season was lower than our expectations, i can't say i changed my mind about got, it's still the best series i've ever watched in my life."

2020-04-15,cassioaugcs,"Awesome until S07. Then, the finale is the most disappointing ever!",10,"i can't recommend anyone to watch through so many hours to get such a disappointing ending in a tv show.yes... from season 1 to 7 it is awesome! but the final season (the 8th) destroys pretty much everything that was built, so well, in the all the previous seasons. every character, every ""mission"", every decision... it was all pretty much useless in the end because the directors decided, for whatever reason, to ignore everything.it makes it the number 1 most frustrating show i have ever seen."

2019-05-20,ahmedsharhabeel,The best Tv show in the history,10,game of thrones is the best tv show ever even if season 8 wasn't like the old seasons but still the greatest tv show.thank you got
2019-05-14,deboracampello,Stunning tv show until season 7 - after that disappointed,4,"i will try to give a honest and fair review about this tv show. since i started to watch game of thrones only dexter and narcos made me stay up after midnight watching the tv show, so i couldn't miss anything.
addicted to it as crazy... although i must say got is by far the best of all...
season 7 episode 10 ending point, when the night king destroys the wall of westeros with undead viserion dragon brought chilling to my bones. that's the quality i have seen from the past seasons of got. i cried when viserion was taken down by the night king. not because i love those dragons, but how it all happened brought tears to my eyes.
i can't remember how many times i watched the serie entirely from the beginning so i wouldn't miss a single detail, once a new season would start.
and season 8 comes... (finally, we all thought).i don't know what is happening but season 8 doesn't ever come near to what i expect of got. the plot holes, the mistakes (even a coffee cup left on the table), the poor writing, either is nothing or everything sort of speaking with almost every episode. it's not what is being presented that bothers me. the story itself makes sense and is tight but how everything is being presented as a whole is what makes this season so disappointing. everything made in such a rush. why? why only 6 episodes? the writers must know that to present this season as the finale in such magnitude and detail even one single season isn't enough.
i wish i could take all seasons as discussion subject to the table even season finale like i always do..d&d or whom ever: if you ever get a chance to change things and re,do it..
here is my advice. make season 7 with 10 episodes. ep 1 and 2 of season 8 shift to season 7 as ep 8 and 9. split the battle of winterfell in two parts: part 1 as finishing episode of season 7 and part 2 starting point season 8. make the battle against the dead more realistic and horrific.. after all this battle was sooo feared. how it ended in season 8, it looked like a joke.
build up a great story as well as characters final development towards the great battle to king's landing. if you want to make daenaerys being seen as the ""mad queen"", for the sake of emilia's effort during the entire show, build up a good plot around it. not making her sit on that dragon and burn everything down. if it was supposed to be so meanless, why kill the mad king in the first place?
and last, don't ever give to such a meanless character like euron the power of taking a dragon again. this is beyond possible! i also cried, but out of anger. how ridiculous it looked...but i promised to give a honest and fair review, so here it is. got i will miss you... for me despite everything this show will never be forgotten..
if a remake or a movie come out, i will be the first to buy a ticket!"
2019-04-29,tyleralbin,Greatest tv I've ever watched,10,if you don't like this episode i'll give you your money back.
2019-05-23,jamieholder-22244,"One of the best shows on TV, last season is a little rushed",1,"game of thrones is one of the best and most binge watchable shows on tv. i know people who have no interest in fantasy shows at all but this show has changed their minds. now that its finished im lost with what to watch next and dont think ill find a show i enjoyed as much as this in a long time. i dont think the first 7 seasons need to be reviewed as the shows reputation speaks for itself.but i have to give some defence to the final season as i think the amount of people giving it negative reviews because they didn't get what they wanted from the series is crazy!! in terms of story all the series are amazing! but in the last 2 series the pacing looses it way. the show is so great at build up and suspense and making the audience wait for what is always a brilliant twist or outcome that, when the pace really ramps up in series 7 & 8 and its seems rushed. we still get those amazing outcomes and payoffs but s8 in particular gives us those a lot quicker without as much build up as previous series. i think if s8 had been 10 episodes instead of 6 it would have received a lot better reaction because it would of had more time to build up to the major things that happen, which is what thrones fans have come to expect from the show.i dont want the negative reviews of the final series to put people off from watching this brilliant show, because everything has to end and when you have show as good as this you cant please everyone.overall s1, 6: 10/10 - flawless
s7: 9.5 - what we've come to expect from thrones but slightly more rushed than normal
s8: 9/10 a brilliant final series but rushed and should have been 10 eps instead of 6, but i enjoyed it anyway"
2020-06-25,harshitdikhit,Irreplaceable🙌🏻,10,"i forgive all the mistakes they make in season 8 , because after all these years hardwork they've done. obviously one of the best series ever made no series can be compared to got it's a masterpiece , if you think that you should watch got after sometime then it's your worst mistake"
2019-10-20,galijasevic-50614,"Started like an artist, finished like a novice",8,"perfect in so much throughout and will always be cherished, but the gradually decaying sense of self and the treatment of characters and storytelling. i blame solely the writers of the story itself, be that d&d or g.r.r.martin, regardless, whoever came up with the resolution to the years of plots and character arcs has committed a hate crime against the fans who would have once shouted praise off rooftops. with time it became less about character, human nature and the art and heart of war and more about spectacle and haphazard and forced conflict. it was once intelligent, every scene a masterpiece and somehow came to be untrustworthy to the point of viewers being able to smell and present a dozen more logical storylines or outcomes because they knew the characters. the magic withered away sadly, poisoning the love of so many people, despite their efforts to preserve what once was so beautiful."
2018-03-05,jakobkuy-51049,"An epic, exciting, expansive, but very flawed show. (Spoiler free)",8,"as you can tell from my rating, i like it alot more than i dislike it.  it's a show about a complex, interesting conflict set in a huge, open, authentic world.the world being authentic is probably due to the incredible production design. entire cities are portrayed with the help of background,actors, set pieces, buildings etc. that have been constructed and placed with care. there are other factors contributing to the world being authentic such as religion, politics, segregation, wealth and poverty. factors that are not over exposed (since that would be boring to watch) but rather discretely shown and mentioned throughout the show, giving you the sense of an authentic world. but authentic world-building is worth nothing if the story taking place in that world isn't good. the story itself, is actually good. it's a very nuanced, complex story, especially when you consider that the fantasy genre is known for the 'good vs evil' black and white, linear type of story.my problems start with the way that the story is being presented to the viewer. this show has a tendency to be over-ambitious, to assume that the viewer knows things that haven't been explained yet (this is probably because the show is based on a series of books). already from the first episode we are getting locations, names, characters, and the relations between those characters thrown at us and expected to understand it, and even enjoy it. the majority of the story of the entire first season is told through dry, emotionless dialogue. the creators embrace 'show don't tell' as the show goes on, but it really took a lot of motivation to keep watching through the first season. i really, really started to enjoy the show in later seasons when i actually understood whom the characters where, and how they all related to each other, now i could properly react to every event happening, although this should have happened a lot sooner.my final complaint is about some of the cinematography (especially during fight-scenes) is poorly executed and makes it hard to understand what exactly is going on. let's say two characters are dueling with swords: the angle changes way too often, and the frame is way to cramped to make out anything that's happening, more than that two people are fighting."
2021-02-21,danielbarkp,Another disappointed fan,1,"this was pretty much a cultural juggernaut that fell from grace on it's last season, a big shame. it's one of those shows i wanted to keep re,watching but once the ending happened the way it did it brought me nothing but an overwhelming feeling of disappointment. today (2021) you can still see the negative emotion in peoples faces whenever the show is mentioned, everyone was on this amazing ride only for it to come crashing down in an incredibly anti-climactic spiral, like going on a roller coaster and when you think the drop is about to happen suddenly the cart moves onto the kids tracks and you are left riding it for a while, it doesn't completely suck but you just want to get out of it. i still re-watch a lot of the scenes and deeply appreciate the memes though, but how funny was it to see got basically disappear off the face of the earth once it was over? never seen anything like it."
2019-01-06,kaspersaldell-23638,First four seasons were great but it gets worse after that.,10,"i think this is probably one of the best tv shows ever made, and i highly recommend it to everyone, (but read the books first, seriously.) which is no wonder since it's an adaptation of the greatest book series that i, and many others, have read. that's just what this show is, an adaptation. it's fine to make some smaller changes here and there and i love most of the original tv scenes that weren't in the books, like littlefinger and varys' conversations, robert and cersei, cersei and joffrey, that white walker scene with craster's baby in the land of always winter, i mean, that's just amazing! i'm okay if the show does some different things as long as it doesn't just completely do it's own thing, which they started doing eventually. the show starts off fantastically and it's almost just like if you were reading the books, only that it was made somewhat differently for tv. the characters are basically all there and the casting was excellent, the plot and the story was totally nailed and we all knew that the show was in good hands, it was almost perfect. season one was pretty much the way they should have kept the show going but it seems that the show got worse when they tried to change things. they changed many things, cut and completely altered several characters (changed their names even, like wut?) some bad changes happened in season 2 already, like the daenerys' quarth plot, her dragons, xaro xhoan daxos and the house of the undying as well. they should have stuck with the characters' story lines, (just naming a few names here:) like gendry, edric storm, thoros of myr, melisandre, the hound, brienne/podrick (and many of the traveling companions/foes they meet on their quest), bronn (especially), the tully family (cat, edmure and brynden) and their relationship, hoster tully, who was mostly cut from the show, and so much more that i could just write an essay about it. one of the things the show seems to do is, instead of just introducing new characters like in the books, they just merge their plotlines together and sometimes they're part of things they weren't part of in the books. even though the show does this, it does, however, get a lot of things right and it works pretty well as a whole, i just wish they'd stop changing things... like the title says, the first four seasons were amazing, to great. i praise the first season the most because it's most faithful to the books, the other three seasons were great as well however, but then we get to season five, and onwards, and everything just goes crazy. the first two books fitted in one season each, s1 and s2. book three was actually split up in two seasons, s3 and s4! which was just great, but i wonder if they could have actually made three. then we get to book four, and five. yep, they made book four and five into one single season, when they should have done three. season five should have been for book four, and seasons six and seven should have been for book five (parts 1 and 2). i can't (curse word) believe that they made season five that way, book five is almost just as long as book three, which got two seasons! in my opinion, the should have just stuck with making a book adaptation instead of going completely off the rails (or should i say, off the books?) with seasons 6 and onward. they should have stopped at season 7, probably, when they were done with the book adaptations, and waited with patience for georgie boy to finish book six, just like we book fans have been doing since 2011. meanwhile, they could have made spinoff series like they're planning on doing right now so it wouldn't be completely dead to people. that would have worked! people would just have to be a little more patient, like us! they could have made book six into two or three seasons, since it's gonna be so incredibly long (1500 pages!!) and then wait for book seven, which i am very doubtful will be released in the near future, if ever. overall it's a great show, and i know this isn't imdbooks but seriously, you should read the books first. i'm giving it a strong 9 / 10, close to 10 / 10, the first four seasons alone are just that good but then season five, six and seven came along and it got worse. i would probably rate the books a 10+ / 10, just saying!... go read them now..."
2021-10-01,dracarys_101,Dont get the fuss about season 8,7,"a phenomenal show. never seen anything like it before, do not get the fuss about last seasons, it was very much enjoyable."
2019-05-21,almiddleton-31572,Will watch again...,1,"for me, the biggest compliment you can pay any show or film is to say you'd rewatch it straight after finishing it.i found myself in the small minority of people who hadn't seen a single frame until a few weeks ago ""dragons, magic and zombies""... ""not my cup of tea"" but a few weeks ago i was too curious so started watching... and couldn't stop watching! i'd go so far as to say it's my favorite tv show of all time, overtaking dexter.the characters are fascinating, the direction is flawless and excluding season 8, the dialogue seemed so authentic and at times hilarious. you find yourself rooting for your favorites and hoping that the swines meet a painful death! joffrey deserved worse!!a handful of scenes throughout are so powerful that i found myself smiling from ear to ear at the brilliance; dany being unharmed by fire twice; first when her children are born, second when she kills the khals. the scene where arya kills her tormentor with many faces and my absolute favorite; where dany has understood all of the valyrian insults and we hear dracarys for the first time.all in all, a superb show that i'm so glad i watched; i feel all the better for it.season 8 wasn't that bad, but it was competing with 7 seasons of excellence."
2019-05-14,neelam_k-63412,Game of thrones amazed me with its spotlight. Amazing drama!,1,"as soon as i started watching this tv in 2012, i am as curious as to know what will happened next. this saga is so handsomely addictive, that i am craving for it each time. but, it is going to en end and i wonder what will replace it with. the strong female characters has been portrait by arya, sansa & dannaery was outstanding."
2019-04-18,jennatung,The greatest show there ever was!,6,"this show is full of complex stories with highly developed characters and unpredictable events. george r. r. martin has beautifully written a series that is as epic as it is poetic. he is always keeping us on our toes as we try to theorize what will happen next. the tv series is beautiful, breathtaking, and heartbreaking. the acting is fantastic, and the cinematography, costume design and make up is ridiculously high quality and detailed. there is light humour throughout the series which is perfectly placed.if you still haven't started watching got, you are truly missing out. i have watched seasons 1 though 7 almost a dozen times now and each time, i better understand the people and the plots, and i uncover some information that i had not noticed before. this show has ruined tv for me, as i fear nothing will ever compare to it's greatness!"
2019-08-04,kylierupp,Game of Thrones,10,i haven't watched the whole entire series. i have watched up to season 3. the first season is kinda boring but then it starts to get very interesting. i did give up watching it though because i wasn't really into it and it's not really my thing but the episodes that i did watch were really good. i would definitely recommend to watch it even though i didn't finish it. i just don't have enough time to binge watch the show.
2019-05-20,black_monster,Best of the bests,3,"this show is full of unexpected moments and plot twists, that makes him the best show in history. you have events and story and even history more than your brain can handle.

2019-05-19,trailerparktb,Get over it people.,10,"this show has been one hell of a ride. and of course people have to take it way too seriously. like it's their life. rushed or not, daenerys was always going to be the mad queen. they showed signs if it all throughout the series. as for cersei, i did feel quite cheated. she deserved to die a brutal slow death. jaime running back to her completely shut down his redemption arc. but with all of that i wouldn't throw the whole season or series away. it's still one of the most amazing shows out there. great cast, writing and visual effects. i am so sick of people hating on d&d for the direction they took. keep in mind george rr martin told them how he wanted to end it, so it wasn't just the writers of the show. it's got. the story was never about the good always getting their way. no one is safe and that's what makes this show so exciting. the fact that people are signing a petition for them to remake the last season is beyond pathetic. what's done is done and there will be no going back. bunch of cry babies."

2019-05-20,shegnog,10/10 now a 4/10 because of the last season,10,"no more to say than what everyone already knows. the last season, particular the last 3 episodes were an absolute embarrassment. dan and dave should never show their faces again. they have ruined what was looking to be an unbeatable tv show. but no. words can't sum up how disgusted i am by the last season. pathetic. truly pathetic. the cinematography and acting was unbelievably good as ever of course, but the writing was that of a parody. i laughed throughout at the ridiculousness and moronisism of the writing. this doesn't even come close to how annoyed and nauseated by the deplorable attempt at writing this last season. d&d have spat in the faces of the actors, crew, fans, grrm and the reputation and memory of the show. they should be ashamed of themselves, but i'm sure they're looking forward to scuttling off for the star wars money. i am angry beyond comprehension and can't begin to imagine how the actors who spent 10 years on this show feel to have this rushed collosal mess as their end to years of work. i am sick to my stomach that these men can call themselves writers. they are incompetent, imbecilic dunces. i will never watch this again. ever."
2019-05-25,chlodavy,Ignore the Season 8 Haters,10,"do you want some cheese with that whine?game of thrones is an amazing show, season 8 included. people are confusing the fact that the show didn't go their way with bad writing. the story going in a different way than you wanted or characters not acting the way you would like doesn't mean the show is bad.the actresses and actors, costumes, locations, script, cgi and special effects are absolutely insane. the storyline has always been shocking and gripping. please watch if you haven't already! game of thrones is truly the best show i have ever seen."
2019-07-10,thakurprashanth-58834,Perfect example of Schadenfreude - 1/10,4,"schadenfreude is a complex emotion, where rather than feeling sympathy towards someone's misfortune, schadenfreude evokes joyful feelings that take pleasure from watching someone fail.got creaters wrote this ending (if you have worst 1000 endings, this will be the last one) just to disappoint fans who wrote fan theories.i have seen disastrous endings like how i met your mother, dexter but creators intentionally disappointed fans to make their theories fail so they choose worst ending which no one would have imagined.i will never watch any series related to got.1/10 , till last two episodes, it is 10/10 but after ending, i am giving 1 as there is no negative rating option."
2021-10-27,daveyruth,phenomenal tv magic,10,"finding this show during its 4th season, was immediately hooked.. a family friend says to me "" you need to give game of thrones and chance"" reluctant at first. after a couple episodes. had to keep watching. and for most of my early twenties was dedicated to the show. even some of my motto's way of thinking were learned from the show. yes the final season had its disappointments, still ending beautifully. and stoked for the prequel series."

2020-01-21,morgantierney,Whiny nerds need too stop whining because season 8 wasn't what they had in mind,10,"season 1,8 where as good as a tv series can get and is pretty much flawless for what is. the first 7 seasons are undisputedly some of the best series ever made and on the same level (if not higher) than shows like breaking bad. then season 8 came along and the majority of fans had already decided how they wanted it to end but it didn't. although it was probably the weakest of the series due to being rushed at times was still very good and if people just watched it for what it was and not what they wanted it to be then it would still be regarded as the best series of all time!"
2018-10-06,henkb-57550,The Only Series that Matters,10,"game of thrones is unprecedented. not only in grandeur, budget and scale, but in sure nerve and complexity. it will not be parallelled for many years to come and it shouldn't be.it does play with some serious themes, which are, by the way, historically accurate to an extent, yet it never outplays its hand and no matter how far they go, people will come crawling back. that is the key to great story telling. the way in which the series conducts itself is so unheard of and unique it took me the whole length of the first three seasons to decide whether or not i liked it. no matter how many times i thought it best to stop watching this nonsense, the more i couldn't help myself. i pushed through and the rest is for the maesters. you will be shocked, rocked, infuriated, saddened, disgusted and enthralled. yet through it all, the blood, the horror and the gore, you will love it. however that fact makes you feel at the end is for your own contemplation."

2017-09-24,srujanandoju,Best TV show Ever,10,"i am not a big fan of tv shows but this is the only show i watched from the beginning to the latest episode till date.people will always love a tv show or a movie with a good story narration and a story with emotional connect.only then the audience feel connected to the story and it stays with them for years.and this does all that.the best thing about game of thrones is it's very huge and the most interesting characters that you come across in the show.the intellectual tyrion lannister, the diplomatic petyr baelish & lord varys, the ruthless cersei lannister, the responsible & duty bound jon snow and many other characters which sink deep into the audience's hearts is what makes the show more lovable.once you start watching an episode you will get involved into the story so much and each and every episode will be very intriguing.if there are any who hasn't watched this show yet and not much of a fan of tv shows i strongly recommend this show game of thrones because no tv show or movie even comes closer to this because my friend ""winter is coming""."
2017-09-24,danrodwalker,A show which continues to impress me with every episode,7,"there is a show which comes around every ten years which just takes my breath away and this is one of them. this show only casts the best actors, has the best cinematography and the best action scenes though it is not for kids. the only problem with this show is the last 3 seasons as it focuses on the more boring characters but i guess it has to do that for character development. in summary this is one of the greatest shows ever made just don't watch it if you are under 18 or with a parent."

2019-05-06,manalexander,Started good went nowhere,10,"first seasons were good really good, the last seasons, probably because the writer of the books left the team, were just mmmmkay, the last season, at least the 3 first episodes, just no ruining the whole series, i'm not sure if i will continue watching the series, the mega epic battle they preperared us for 7 seasons was so stupid irrational and boring, nothing interesting happened finish in the most stupid lazy written and not really creative way, sooo many stupid miments, like since when white walkers even need to eat why the giant decided to eat lady mormot? a nice snack? why did yiu literally just kill all dethraki? any reason for the usless charge? why to hide people in crypts while literally fighting someone who rises the dead? seriously aria just teleported from no where and killed the night king? the crows carried her? may be lord of light? does her ultimate have cool down?could you pay a battle advisor to desigh the battle not to be ridiculous and atupid, they literally had the same budget as lord of the rings which was 3 times longer, but yet here we are having a horible waste of time"
2019-06-12,chaitanyamishra-00135,The final season sucked...end of story,10,"the starting 4 seasons are fantabulasly awsome...season 5 and 6 are good...than it all goes down the drain in the last two seasons. with all the good actors they had, and took 2 years to produce the last season, they provided us the worst season of all time in game of thrones. #disappointed"
2020-01-21,saragsousa,I've erased season 8 from my mind,10,"as a person who has read and loved all game of thrones' books and fell in love with the series since the first episode i must erase from my mind that 8th season has ever came out. i refuse to accept that one of the greatest series of all time has been ruined in a couple episodes and therefore, for the 7 brilliant and amazing seasons that hbo has released and for the great cast (kit harrington is hands,down one of the best actors alive), i give this series a 10! a well deserved 10 for all the good times i spent watching this!"
2018-08-23,farazali-75005,Mind blowing!!!,10,i have never seen a show quite like this. it's like your watching it for real!
2019-04-09,whesleysgirl,Just wow!,10,it takes a lot to keep me involved and interested in a series. and game of thrones just nailed it. period. end of story! my life will consist of weekends of reruns when it's over. i'm so sad!
2018-08-27,jasonsweat,Just good all around,10,"i'll try to keep it short and sweet. as a reader of the books and a huge fan of them, the show has not let me down. superb acting all around. they did wonderful with almost every acting choice. it made me forget how i even pictured most of the characters before the show. that's when you know you have a solid adaptation. the good guys get it rough and the show stays true to the book's savagery that no one is safe.the show should only be for adults or mature audiences. it doesn't hold back on nudity, rape, murder, lies, deceit, and torture. that's one of the things that makes the show so good because the books didn't either and it's important to keep true to the source content. this is a fantasy lover's dream with midevil elements everywhere from wars with sword and shields and bows to dragons to magic. but it seems to appeal to everyone. people i didn't even think would like this show are becoming fans. why? because the characters are so good and well written. throw that in with amazing settings, great plots, beautiful and fitting music, and just all around creative writing.i wanted to address a few concerns that i see in most negative reviews.  1. nudity and obscenity : this show gets a lot of negative reviews for nudity, gore, and obscene scenes. but i don't understand that. don't knock a show because you can't handle it. the books weren't quite as bad but they were still unforgiving and unrelenting in the same manner. the show obviously isn't for everyone, but i wish those people just didn't watch it instead of giving shallow, bias, and uneducated reviews for which half the time they don't really know what they're talking about.
2. straying from the source content. (books)
the rest of the negative reviews usually pertain to the show straying away from the books on some details for little to no reasons. the truth is that the books are so vast, the show has to omit some character and change a few plot happenings, twists, and outcomes to stay within time constraints for budget reasons. the show has the highest budget to date for a tv show, even with the changed details. i was bummed about a few characters not being there and a few changes that happened to some that were. but i understood there was no way they could fit everything from the book. but hell, the show even improved on a lot of characters that were a but underwhelming in the book. got will go down as one of the best shows ever. appreciate it for what it is and don't just look for unfair reasons not to like it. it's a great adaptation but also stands alone as david and d.b.'s (the writers) own take on a song of ice and fire."
2020-12-30,jondintheer,most probably the best hbo series so far,9,"seasons 1 and 2 started of slow imo but you could already fall in love with some of the characters. seasons 3 and 4 became more and more interesting
seasons 5 and 6 were definitely the best seasons and 'hardhome' was the best episode out of all seasons
seasons 7 and 8 were quite disappointing, especially season 8 because it felt rushed and they easy could've made 10 episodes for both of them."

2019-05-16,yaman-52899,Bad,10,that is season very very very bad it's very bad bad experience bad service very bad i had bad
2019-05-24,mansta-03805,Had to change my rating after the end,1,"in the beginning, got seemed like one of the best tv shows ever made, at least as long as it used material from the novels. art direction, cast, acting, music, all of these are great. the writing up to and including season 6 is also top. the decline started in season 7, but season 8 is absolutely atrocious with the worst ending possible for a tv show. until the last episode of season 8 i had given a 10/10 rating. i had to change it to 5/10, because the horrible writing of the last season (stupid character development, plot holes the size of the pacific, logical errors, flat dialogue, stretches of flat out boring sequences in a completely rushed storytelling, totally meaningless ending) spoiled everything so much that i will definitely never watch it again, and i cannot possibly recommend the series to anybody."
2019-04-17,wacketysax,Bored and More Bored,10,i'm glad there's a fast forward button on my video player. series started out interesting and slipped into dull dross
2020-06-02,sunnyesakethreddy,It's one of the best.. except the last episode of the series,7,"a masterpiece... it might seem more like something inappropriate, raw or violent.. but it is how it should be.. can't be much more authentic. that's all i can say."
2020-07-07,lolitsusef,If only season 8 wasn't rushed,10,"the show from season 1 all the way to season 7 was pretty good like gorgeously good. i admired the characters. what ruined season 8 in my opinion was the rushed writing what i mean is dany becoming mad could've literally been a whole season and the war with the night king could have been a while other season same with the war of cersei. the problem isn't with the events it's the little to no air to breath between episodes they literally crammed 2,3 seasons in 6 episodes six!!. i don't mind the events but only if each event was done in a proper manner which makes them important not cramming all the important stuff in 6 episodes. hear me out let's say season 8 was against the night king and in the last episode he dies. and season 9 would've been cersei killing danys dragon and missandei we would have seen dany going mad and see what causes her to burn down a whole city
but season 8 literally shifts the character 180
we don't see her change or grieve instead it's like the writers wanted to fill in between the lines and anyway to continue the final season (season 10) would have been the mad queen and how they would remove her. they literally cram all this in 6 freaking episodes. the audience felt like a lot of important stuff was happening that it underweighed the season.
overall the season events weren't bad. but d&d wanted to fit 3 seasons in one and that didn't work out properly"
2019-05-22,cgparas,Wow! A sixth grader could have ended GOT better.,10,"no spoilers here: just understand when you watch the last season you will be able to point out so many obvious bad qualities. guinness will be interested in awarding these directors the record for tv fans biggest let down.obviously every scene was a flip of the coin decision, rushed to a level disappointment of the viewer wasn't a concern.eventually, i'll look back and agree that got is more than one star, because there are many, many enjoyable hours to watch. the frustration alone knowing i would have trusted my neighbors 12 year old to have better ended this show, relieves me from any guilt of leaving one star."
2019-05-21,majedalaleeli,Sad,7,the series is very beautiful but the last season made me sad .. the events are secret and there are not as many dialogues as we used to
2019-05-13,mohamedcairo,Brace yourself for the biggest disappointment if you just started watching,10,"if you're just starting to watch the show and intrigued by the smart plotlines, brilliant writing, world building and inner logic of the show. either stop right now and save yourself the biggest disappointment of your entire tv watching experience, or enjoy it while it lasts for the first 4 amazing seasons and excellent season 6. but please don't look at it as anything but the biggest high budget and nonsensical soap opera you'll ever see as soon as the build,up phase ends."
2018-05-03,y-83341,Good,10,like this very much. and enjoy the time. i want this for 5 times. and read the book
2012-12-27,stupid_young_fellow,Rousing entertainment for our baser natures,1,"i am enjoying this series immensely, but at the same time i feel a little guilty about that, as it is very, very shrewdly and deliberately calculated to be a kind of ""carnival of depravity"" appealing to all our baser instincts.it's probably a combination of the work of both george martin and the tv writers, but virtually every situation and almost every character is calculatedly twisted to come up with the most unsavory or grotesque slant possible.just off the top of my head and in no particular order: (spoilers here) a cunning, duplicitous courtier is also an accomplished and cruel pimp; a seemingly noble order of watchmen is made up mainly of rejects and rapists; an elderly holy man is dragged out of bed with a prostitute and revealed to be a deceitful liar; a mad queen breast,feeds her too-old-for-it and obviously mentally disturbed child while giving audiences; almost all plot exposition is delivered while characters have vigorous sex with prostitutes; a beautiful queen and a handsome knight are revealed to be incestuous twins and unspeakably evil monsters who cripple an adventurous little boy; an exiled prince is a loathsome selfish jerk who wants to pimp his sister out to a savage barbarian warlord; that warlord kills an enemy by ripping his tongue out of his throat and pours molten gold over the jerk-prince's head; an exiled knight is a slave-trader; a prodigal son comes home to his abusive family and unwittingly sexually fondles his sister; a brutal warrior had his face hideously burnt in childhood by his even more brutal brother; when the brutal brother loses a joust, he hacks off his horse's head; a favorite knight of the ladies is revealed to be the gay lover of a king; a clever, disenfranchised younger son of a ruler is also a whore-monger, an alcoholic and a dwarf for good measure; a beloved ruler is executed abruptly; a young king turns out to be a caligula-style psychopath; a gentle retarded man is shown hopping around nude with a giant dangling sex organ; a ruler of a wilderness castle rapes and impregnates his daughters, granddaughters and great granddaughters and leaves his male offspring in the snow for monsters to take; every other throne room seen looks more like a dungeon than a place used for running a kingdom... it's so over-the-top grotesque it's almost laughable. i could go on and on with these types of examples, too. there are dozens of little shocking moments like these in every episode. about the only gross medieval cliché they don't pile on is the black death.the show is fancy, expensively made exploitation for a mass audience that outdoes in shock value even the kind that in the more refined and restrained past was presented only in cheap lurid grindhouse and drive-in flicks. it's exploitation, but it not so much exploiting any particular person or group, as it is exploiting our natural human appetites for the bizarre, the disturbing, the tragic and the twisted. it's the same set of primal impulses that made the roman arena such a blockbuster. it's the same instincts that make us slow down and rubberneck for blood and bodies when we pass a traffic accident.people look at this kind of ultra-violent, depraved stuff and assume it is very historically accurate and realistic to ""the way it was"" in our own medieval times, but to tell the truth, it's greatly exaggerated. it's taken in the same way that people claimed the ""mud and rags"" graphic approach to the italian spaghetti westerns of the 60s was realistic, even though that genre was just as far fetched in its own opposing way as the ultra-clean cut westerns of gene autry and roy rogers. it would be like people in the far future thinking that rambo movies and porno flicks were accurate representations of life in the late 20th and early 21st century, because ""civilization wasn't as advanced back then"".game of thrones is pretty much the famous gory ""black knight scene"" from monty python & the holy grail, only running for dozens of hours, & played not for laughs, but in dead seriousness. it tries so hard to constantly outdo its own horrors and titillation and exuberantly and gleefully wallows in negative images and emotions.don't get me wrong, i am really entranced by the show. being human, i am not immune to vicariously enjoying strife, sex, violence and grotesqueness, but i can't help feel a little sad that the envelope has been pushed yet further and to nervously wonder what even greater vileness will come to our screens in the future.this is very low, crude and base entertainment, cynically made by jaded imaginations to cash in on our inner savages. it's not at all uplifting, enlightening or inspiring. but it certainly is entertaining. if you like this sort of thing, then this is the sort of thing you will love.i would definitely not allow anyone younger than 18 to watch this. i don't feel this way about too many mass market movies or tv shows, but i definitely think this series could be harmful to a child or young teen's psyche."
2021-02-03,sumant-35635,Gave it 10/10 but AFTER s8 i know for sure it deserves 1/10,10,lazy writing and lazy direction decisions of season 8 ruined everything. don't waste your time watching 7 seasons just to get dissapointed on season 8. just pass it.
2019-05-23,nowaaafff-71131,0,9,it's fantastic art it will repeated again. i hope the spin off which will be coming soon will answer alot of questions

2019-06-20,frhnmrz,Greatest TV Show I've Ever Watched,10,"the show had a very long journey. i don't mind with the last season. george martin is a genius storywriter, he made an brilliant fiction with a lot of events, full of epic drama. i make it 10/10 for the whole tv show, and i won't regret it!"
2019-07-12,nielsmulder-39518,Season 1-7 Magnificent Season 8 Total Crap,10,"nice show. good acting, good story. can't review a tv show on 1 bad season."
2020-06-07,framegenius,Amazing in the first 4 seasons,10,"season 1: 9/10 season 2: 9/10

season 4: 9/10
season 5: 7/10
season 6: 7/10
season 7: 5/10
season 8: 2/10it's extremely hard to rate this show because game of thrones in the first 4 seasons is one of the greatest and most enthralling tv,shows i have ever seen, but the rest is mixed. season 5 and 6 are still really good and have a lot of good stuff in them, like the battle sequences, but make some bad decisions and are just not as clever and engaging as the previous seasons. season 7 makes a lot of bad decisions and has a lot of bad writing, but gets by on the great characters and some great battle sequenses like before. season 8 is one of the most dissappointing and rushed last seasons of a tv-show i have ever seen. the problem isn't that it's just a bad season, but also that all of the major plot points and characters that were built up over all of the other seasons don't get their payoffs and instead end them in the dumbest way possible. the last 2 episodes especially are two of the worst episodes i have ever seen, even worse than a lot of stuff in 13 reasons why. because of this, it hurts the entire show and makes it feel kinda pointless. really all the major characters and plot lines like jon snow, arya, brann, the night king, the lord of lights prophecy and who is gonna rule the iron throne is ruined. you know.... everything the show was about. still highly recommend anyone to watch the first 4 seasons, then season 5 and six if you loved the previous ones since there is some great stuff in them and then 7 and 8 with warning you that it will become bad and dissapointing."
2018-09-25,tahlilom,BEST SERIES EVER !!!!!,10,my words cant even explain how much i love this show
2018-07-20,neilfrancis-49255,Adult TV fantasy drama couldn't get any better,10,"a game of life and death. this is, without doubt, the fantasy drama of the decade. full of action and adventure, visual splendour and superb and sometimes unpredictable characters.very difficult to fault this as an overall series. some episodes are less memorable than others, but across as many seasons, this is totally understandable. many scenes will be engraved in your mind.with the superb acting and the dramatic scenery, you are easily immersed in the kingdoms. as the characters develop, you feel real empathy towards some and hatred towards others. love them or loathe them, no character is immune from the axe, quite literally.from moments of tenderness, to gut wrenching shock and horror, this story has everything. if you haven't done so already, watch it from start to finish, you won't be disappointed!"
2019-09-18,guubriel,LOVED THIS SHOW BEFORE..,10,"it's just sad. re,watched the series every year and now i dont think i can re-watch it ever again. the last season ruined about everything"
2020-04-05,jacobalvaradogarcia,"BEGINNING = AMAZING, ENDING = HEARTBREAKING",9,i loved game of thrones ever since the first season and i just binge watched everything and i fell in loved with the show. if i could describe the show in one word it would be intense. 10/10
2018-07-17,walawala-70139,THE MOST Overrated Show,10,"first let me just say that this show is probably a 4 or 5, but since the overall score is 9.5, i felt compelled to counteract it; thus the rating of only 1 star.first off, let me begin with the positives, which, believe me, won't take long. the acting is pretty good, and the special effects are decent. that's pretty much it when it comes to positives.now for what justifies the single star. simply put, the show has virtually no plot. it's basically a bunch of houses vying to become king, because the old king was overthrown, which by the time of the second season, we have all but forgotten why. this hardly counts as a plot. there is no climax, there is no hook, it's basically a documentary of a fictional land.now onto the characters. there a million houses, all interchangeable, with house mottos probably generated off of a website. you could not mention a single house for the entire season and nobody would even notice! characters are killed off (unnecessarily gory) for fun. this is not so much a problem as there are way too many characters to begin with. however, you immediately realize there is a problem when none of the deaths cause you to feel any emotion. this is because none of the characters are developed, and the ones that are aren't likeable at all. to top this off, there is constant violence, sex, rape, and nudity. if i wanted porn, i would have just searched up videos on the internet! there are a lot of people on here who justify this by saying that this is somehow historically accurate and displays the plight of the people in the middle ages. if you wanted to watch that, why don't you watch a documentary??? to summarize, there is plot, no likeable characters, and way too much unnecessary content. i'd rather watch paint dry than this crap."
2019-04-17,allanwaters-86617,Better than Dallas!,10,"yes, my favourite mini series of all time (the original incarnation of dallas) , has been gazumped by got.there arent enough superlatives to convey just how magisterial and fantabulous this tv series is.from the sweeping cinematography, the stentorian and beguiling soundtrack, the myriad of multidimensional characters (the hound is my favourite character of all time) and the magnetising storyline , no other tv show has similitude or can simply compete with got.even the excessive verbosity in some scenes is captivating and gorganizing. the violence is lurid and grotesque at times (seeing the mountain plunge his thumbs into a combatants eyes, and shatter his skull, was repulsive and grueling), the sex scenes were shot gracefully if not a little graphically at times (i've always found sex scenes irritating).i could pontificate on into sempiternity about how splendiferous got is. if the putative consenseus dosent inspire you to watch got, then permit myself to scream in your ear - watch it!"

2021-10-24,prototypegod,A prolific example of squandered potential.,10,"game of thrones started strong. right out of the gate we had fabulous dialogue, interesting characters doing interesting things. sex, action, mystery. if this review was for the first 4 seasons of this show, it would easily score an 8 of 10 or higher. then the show runners ran out of books to crib scenes from and we go from intelligent characters saying, and doing intelligent things to quotes like ""i drink and i know things"". the showrunners wanted to end this show, and it shows with no payoffs, next to no dialogue, and lots of puttering around doing nothing."
2019-03-06,danielmorrisdev,Thank the old gods and the new... For the most epic TV series ever!,5,got (game of thrones. (duh!!)) is by far one of the most amazing tv series adapted from a series of books that i have truly ever seen. of course this is my opinion but one that many share.this series is in my top three favorite. i don't want to give anything away so i don't want to spoil anything for anyone but i do recommend watching it. in the very least you must try the first three episodes. as a rule of thumb give any show the first three episodes and give any book the first three chapters.
2020-12-12,agarioagario,After the conclusion it is time to vote less,10,"almost everybody knows by now, that quality cannot be achieved without the apropriate time to develop it. the series went downhill when no more bluepprint from martin was available. i dearly hope that the responsible writers experience well deserved backlash in their careers.
watchable till season 5/6.
season 8 is a joke.
protip: only when you start from the very beginning one realizes how far the series drifted from it´s roots. only then you can experience why you fell in love with it in the first place.ps no more jobs for db weiss and david benioff"

overrated. seen better shows.
season 1 is great, amazing in nearly every way
season 2 is bad, boring. i expected more from ""the best show to have ever existed"" and from the most popular show."
2019-05-02,missymk,Amazing,10,"this show is amazing! it has everything you need. there's never a dull moment. fighting, love, power, dragons, drama. definitely keeps your attention."
2019-05-20,allawegy,wow,1,"best series ever made, best of everything... actors, story, everything was the best of all time"
2021-06-16,kunalhaner,Greatest show with epic story lines,10,"there's no other show as amazing as this.there is suspense, thriller, action, war, comedy, politics, romance, everything!this is my all time favourite show along with friends and i keep them on top in different categories.last few seasons were lil disappointing but still great show!you don't wanna know more because i won't give any spoilers, go watch it! first few episodes may be a bit complicated but you'll get it by the time you finish 5,6 episodes."
2018-03-13,spaztastic99,No Need to Watch,10,"while i appreciate the idea that good guys don't always win, i don't need to watch something where the bad guys almost always do. there is enough bad news in real life to spend my time watching fictional attempts at depressing a viewer."
2019-05-21,chrisjamesrn,Last episode fail!,10,it could have been so much more!!. it feels like the ending of battlestar galactica
2020-07-24,ericdaylton,Last season sucked,6,"just watch the first 4 or 5 seasons, don't bother with the rest."
2018-12-13,jerseyk-96652,Love this show,9,such a good show. the character you either really hate or just love. definitely recommend

2019-04-17,joshuasayagh,Wow,10,wow i have never seen a better show than that. you can never know what is waiting for you each episode.
2019-05-20,banditsgirl-22120,good until it wasn't,1,"the first few seasons were so good but i feel so let down by the last season. they gave us so many details that seemed like they were going to play a major roll down the line and then never came up again. i don't think the writers paced themselves properly and then instead of being able to wrap up all these loose plot lines they just completely forgot about them and gave us an ending that nobody, and i mean nobody, wanted. i don't want to say that i wouldn't recommend the series but i would forewarn people that the final season is very underwhelming when compared to everything before it."
2019-05-13,vbguy-53439,Excellent,10,this has been a long time coming and everyone that's upset was lulled into a false sense of security. the core of this show is shock and awe and disbelief. that's how it gathered such an audience and following.
2019-06-10,albinsikblad,Simply a masterpiece!,1,i can't and i won't try to express how much i feel for this show. just watch it and you will love it!
2020-05-19,rajatsingh-66515,#1,9,"this series is best that of i have ever seen. yeah it has very sad ending, still love it."
2019-06-07,spidy_perfect,Brilliant,1,"really fantastic storyline and one of the best series i have ever watched... until season 8. it was so rushed, left so many plot holes and ruined many characters and was a real let down. having said that, 7 very good seasons compared to 1 bad one is extremely good going as many series get boring after about 3,4. overall very good and is a must watch for anyone who has the time"
2019-01-02,vpxxqv,Sooo goooooooood,10,i love this man i sooo lovet york is the time to be the one to you again and see how you feel and how much i can i have a good night sleep well i love you bye bye see how you're doing love love you
2019-05-13,danielpetrovic-99358,Amazing tv show with a horrible and lazy ending,9,the tv show is one of the best series ever made but as time went by they rushed to finish it as fast as they can and ruined a lot of characters along the way. shame that the fans are so disrespected after years of tremendeous support. it was a 9/10 for me before the last season and many would give it less than my 6/10 after this season but i think it is still worth a watch.
2019-05-19,malina_burada,One of the best TV shows we will ever get,10,"this show has changed the way i look at any tv series and that is because it has the most amazing crew , actors and directors . i will be forever thankful for their hard work and dedication. ps : no matter how bad season 8 is , this show made history and will be remembered as a tv masterpiece ."
2019-05-13,abtinmosalaei,Dragon!!,10,the writer whenever he wants the dragon drops with a shot whenever he thinks he's a city and burns it's my hope that the last part will end well.
2019-05-20,abtinmosalaei,Wow,10,the series was interesting and i think it was a lot better than breaking bad and i hope to be in a higher position.
2019-05-20,goldenyoulden-73386,Great until last season,10,i know it has a really bad wrap but it really is true. the last season completely changed my perspective on the entire series. season 8 was way too rushed. great show but the creators sent it downhill after veering off the original scripts from the writer's books.
2019-03-09,adewoletop,Amazing,1,best series i've laid my eyes on. all round amazing
2019-12-30,jacques-77287,Best tv ever made,9,"script writing, casting , acting , storyline, music score, twists and never ends as you expected right to the end deserves 10/10"
2019-01-29,rickmorelton,Violent and depressing,9,"have to say that shortly after the start of season five i have become weary of so much sadistic violence over and over again and not anything good ever happening. the story line keeps dragging on and on with seemingly only new angles on just what different and graphic forms of killing and mutilation can be devised and delivered with optimum special effects. it is a game of thrones and a game where not only nobody wins but just how badly everyone loses, one at a time, told in layered story groupings, episode after episode. enough already. apparently this is what keeps the series ratings high and i just no longer want to be a part of this feed so goodbye game of thrones."
2021-04-22,bennyfolkvord,Season 1-6 and then came 7-8,7,"this was a really great show, from season one it start of good and its entertaining, with al in one show just loved it. then came season 7 and it was down hill from ther, had to push my self getting to the end of season 8, finaly done today. the produserer sould just have droppd the last season it was a rush from start to finish, nothing was done well at al."
2019-04-30,lilmanz,The best one,10,"i can not discrabe how much i like that movie! the scenes, the actors, everything is perfect to the last detail!"
2019-05-20,andrewnielsen-76740,Garbage ending,10,"the last two episodes violated rules about writing , for no pay off. example: repeated speaking the plot, but the past plot. death of cersea lannister was deus ex machina. the white walker king should have been killed after she had stolen someone's face. dany going mad was mad."

2019-05-01,actemel,Great Disappointment After S8 Ep3,1,"we have been waiting for the white walkers,the night king,the great war,the prince that was promised for the past 8 years and is that the ending that we deserve : arya flying from nowhere like a rat and stabbing the great night king,who survived far worse foes for the past 8000 years?? what about jon ? why was he resurrected then if he was not meant to kill the night king?"
2019-04-29,amrsamir-61624,"GOT, EPIC & Nothing will ever compete it",1,"i have guessed 1,000,001 scenarios for episode 3 and non of them was true. a mixed emotions with love grieving, pride, worrying, happy and sad in one episode! wrapped with the most epic directing and acting not depending on the main characters! this is genius! no this is madness! thank you hbo!"

2019-04-02,adityabarke,Excellent!!!,10,cinematography of the show is perfect. perfect show to watch...
2021-04-17,aryandpmb,Too damn good,5,"this is no doubt one of the best shows out there . i even thought about giving it a perfect score but the disappointment of the final season meant that i had to give it a 9/10 . it's beautifully crafted with a complex yet engaging plot , well fleshed out characters , superbly choreographed battle scenes , intriguing politics and a fantasy that's firmly grounded in a human reality . the show does have dragons and people rising out of graves and stuff but its heart is at human relations and the political power game . the series is brutal and unforgiving in a way it's compelling but it's also soft when it needs to be . there is no fixed line between the black and white which makes it even more interesting . all in all it's a masterpiece and it's a shame that it had to go out with disgrace . yet , as the show time and again reminds us , "" all men must die "" so everything must come to an end but and that's all that we have for our solace and consolation ."

2019-05-20,enecclaudia,Very poor show,10,"one would expect that after 8 seasons and so much built up to have a great finale. it could not have been further from the truth. it was just a travesty. the characters were bent and they contradicted what they previously stated in previous episodes. john did not received what he deserved for all his work and fight. further more he was banished to the wall to rejoin the nights watch, and so his line is extinct. tyrion got away with his sins by becoming again hand of the king... so much more power and no punishment, sansa got what she wanted, even though all of the remaining kingdoms could have obtained independence, which it would have actually made sense. how did sam become a grand mester when he did not even finished his training. bran became king on what merits?!?!?!? and the examples could continue. to conclude the incompetent ones where rewarded and the ones who actually fought where punished. so a very poor showing.i will actually save some money as i am not going to pay for the remaining episodes."
2020-08-15,karthikhegde-85321,Great series,10,"on of the best series i ever seen. very twist at 8th season.
good dialogues."
2019-05-14,ardadogruer,Season 8,10,"almost perfect but unfortunately ruined(in season 8) tv series...the cast is perfect, acting is almost perfect, cgi is amazing but, why do they decided to do it like this? in season 8 i feel like they are compressing the scenario to make it short even it's not neccessary. it's nonsense, when they have enough money to make a new season or at least additional a couple of episodes... they have huge audience to watch it but they made just 6 episodes...this criticizing is for season 8 except the last episode. i hope you enjoy it.first of all, the winter that we have been waiting for 7 seasons just took 30 minutes... seriously? we thought when the winter and the night king comes out of the darkness, they will destroy(at least) a couple of things but the night king and his army fell in just 30 minutes. and i have to ask that before i continue: the dothrakis were sacrificed? because if they didn't, then why did they attack trough the enemy without any dragon glass? they didn't even know how does a dead look like. anyway, they went to die, and they died, but after that where did daenerys targaryen find so many dothrakis to fight in king's landing? when it comes to siege, i think it's totally inattentive. the lannister army, the iron fleet, the golden company they all crushed in 3 minutes. 50 or 60 scorpions missed the dragon, but in previous episode all 3 arrows hit rhaegal and buried him in the water, maybe euron and his army should go for a check for their eyes! after the bells ringed what daenerys and her army did is just blood bath! they told us that will be a great war but all we saw is a great butchery. also the honorable northern people was trying rape when there's a dragon flies right above them and burning the city!! in short the siege is including a lot of pointless behavior and pointless visual blood effects (i think this is disgusting by the way). we didn't see the main characters like jon snow or daenerys targaryen so much. jon was speechless and daenerys was ruthless, that's all we saw, we couldn't feel what they feel, we couldn't realize what they want to do. the end of the couple of characters was ridiculous and it feels like their business is not finished. i hope the last episode will not be disappointing as the rest of the season but the scenario is leaked and probably the last episode is going to be the most disappointing one.i just want to write something about season 8, i don't say it's trash, not bad at all in my opinion but it could be much more beautiful season than this, sorry..."

2019-04-29,aregmi-67070,"Amazing Direction, Acting, Visuals, and Audio but Storytelling?",10,"the idea of deconstructing the purpose, motivations, and story of the most powerful/mystical/mysterious character in game of thrones, the night king, was very exciting, and i had been waiting for years for this episode, to finally know what was inside grrm's head. he has repeatedly explained in depth at how none of the characters in his universe, like people, are either wholly good or wholly evil, and so i had so many theories regarding the night king and was really looking forward to finally knowing the truth, ... but didn't get anything. the writers completely avoided adding any element to the biggest threat to humanity. the threats of the white walkers started the show, and we don't even an explanation on why they were doing the things that they were? i was hoping for the integration of everything , azor ahai, the purpose of the three eyed raven and for bran being shown the truth about jon's origin by bloodraven, the lord of light, daenerys and her dragons, but all it took was a relatively new recruit of the faceless men to take down this powerful threat that was built up for 8 seasons, and that too in front of his army. are you kidding me? was it really as simple as a faceless man sneaking up on him to end it all? also, how did sam and jaimie even manage to survive while being overrun with thousands and thousands of wights? just very disappointed that the writers didn't even attempt to pull of a synthesis of the most burning questions and most mystical and important elements and storylines of the universe. :/"

2019-05-05,johnpavith,Great but....,10,"game of thrones has been one of the best tv series in the past decade and when the director d.b weiss told media that they have to wait 2years for season8 fans where furious but still hopeful
the season 8's first two episodes where okay and good at the same time
like lemonade on a warm sunny day
but episode 3 was a huge disaster
the whole season was black(dark)
the screen had to be brightened to the fullest in order to see what was going on but still that was not enough.this was only one of the many blunders that took place
the night king one of the main vilan of the series was killed off in an instance
i mean the fans (such as myself) where expected more from this episode
at least a word from his mouth or a battle scene with jon
in the end we have just wait and watch i guess"
2019-04-17,yanislachguer,game of thrones,1,"the title of my serie is game of thrones.the genre of this serie it's fantasy , the country of origin is usa ,the number of season it's heigt whis seventy,three episodes . the origin of a languages it's english . i very like this series because one of the main characters it's daenerys targaryen , she 's mastering three dragons . my note of this serie is ten out of ten."

2019-05-16,salemalkhalifa,Best of the best,10,this took it to the next level. the writers imagination is very wide no heros in this show the best ever.
2019-05-12,templar-14282,Season 8,10,"although i understand the many people having serious (and real) problems with season 8 , i very much like it just as the 7 seasons before. for a show grown this big it is impossible for the got writers, directors and all the other crew and cast, to make everybody feel stisfied about the actions in the show. it is a solid fact that many people like it and many not. another fact is that a true fan will always be a fan no mater what. (i am not saying that people are forbidden to not like it.) i admit that there were moments which made me nervous. one (actually multiple) of them is the extensive use of plot armor in episode 3. for e.g. sam should have died when jon made the decision to leave him in the courtyard, it would have been a great end for his character (my opinon). but we haven't seen the full season yet and as qyburn said about ""the targaryen girl"" maybe the writers have other plans for the characters. no matter what i always be a fan of game of thrones, the best qnd most popular series since a long time."
2019-06-08,huntisonvi,It is a 9 for me.,10,the first 6 seasons were a 9.5 and that is a 75% of the show. even though the last two seasons were so rushed and everything felt so unlogical they still had some great episodes and they didn't ruin the entire show. actually endgame had way more ploteholes and it is at 8.8 for a movie.. it is just the snowball effect
2019-06-24,cakesandpi,The biggest let down ever made on TV.,10,"from season 1,4 game of thones was the best show ever made. from season 5-6 the show became more predictable and the writing wasn't as good, charters writing was bad was bad for new characters but the visuals and epic moments made sense and are movie quality, still the best show ever made.season 7 is where all the biggest plot holes open wide, the writing is lazy and is pretty much just made for fan service. at times it feels like they made the season backwards. acting starts to take a hit as well which was usually really well done, you start to think if the acting was good in the seasons prior or was the writing and source material the reason for the acting being very good, it's now only one of the best shows made now. i had my problems with season 7 saying it was a 6.5/10 but i figured they would still at least make season 8 redeem it some and that season 8 would be at least a 6.5/10 or better.season 8 was beyond anything as bad as i could have thought it was going to be. the story wasn't even game of thrones anymore it just had the same actors and the characters had the same names. the writing is some of the worst i've even seen on tv(day time drama bad), acting was bad but i'm not sure it's there fault, character story lines are proved pointless the entire time. other characters get shoehorned into situations that are stupid. all character development/decisions are dumb, cringe, make no sense, contradict themselves, out of place. all visual/sound effects and music are fine.game of thornes should be what a show aims to be, it should be the best show ever made but none of those th8ngsnare true because of mostly season 8 but season 6 & 7 built a lot of the th8ngs they wante to put into the show. they lost all source material from the books after season 5, dan & dave have shown they are actually really bad writers, show runners.i wouldn't recommend anyone watching this show, it's pointless, the let down will just make you angry."

2019-04-24,zkphotographs,Do you really love cinema & television if you don't love GOT?,10,"game of thrones is one of the best shows of all time, possibly the harry potter of tv shows dare i say it. this show makes you love its characters, be apart of their journey and somehow tear your heart out while it's still beating. the scores, the visuals, the acting, it's sublime. someone who loves cinema and tv cannot not love this show, it wouldn't make sense. this show has been a part of a lot of people's lives for almost a decade now and it has never failed us and isn't about to now in its finale season. if you haven't watched it, do it. you will not regret it."

2020-06-02,indianaandrew-91395,IMPORTANT: Read This Before Starting,5,"the first five seasons are incredible, some of the best tv ever made. the next two are just good. the last, the 8th season is so, so bad, i genuinely wish i had never started. now, i fully believe the journey is more important than the goal in life, however the final season completely invalidates all the ones before it.all the character's personalities are abandoned at will, so the character development was for nothing; all the lore, made irrelevant as it is shown just to have no meaning in the end, and even contradicted; and nearly all the events that transpired are made meaningless with no connection or effect by the end. one season alone would be all that's needed to set the status quo for what it was by the beginning and end of the 8th season.it is for those reasons why i hope i can deter you from starting the show. however there are two exceptions: 1. if you're someone who knows you would never, ever read a book of even your favorite story of all time that damn nearly changed your life, then go ahead, as long as you don't care about having your heart broken at the end, and just want the fun of the ride.
2. you usually don't care much for stories with lead up, lore, and a connecting epic tale. you, generally, like one,shot sitcoms, crime shows, and dramas more than you'd like a progressing show like breaking bad or lost.otherwise, just save yourself the pain, and wait for the books, or not at all. watching the show will just spoil the major plot points while ruining how they actually come to be."

2020-09-02,deadpoolsh,Please remake the finale season,1,"absolutely game of thrones is one of the best series in the history.....but the last season is not like the oldest seasons is too short
so please remake it
we want game of thrones againnnnnn☹💔"
2019-04-29,awkwardhorror,Incredibly Anti-Climactic,10,"game of thrones used to be a show about how the petty squabbles of humanity were a threat to it's very existence. the fight for the throne has always been about personal distractions being placed over what we all know was the real danger: the white walkers. winter came, as we were promised from the very first scene of the very first episode. and what was the point? so the night king could die via deus ex machin,aria and we can spend the last three episodes watching the remaining characters (you know, the plot armor army) deal with a drunk pregnant lady and a generic crazy guy. the episode was pretty enough, when you could see anything. strategy was so bad they honestly all deserved to die for how freaking disorganized everyone was. music was the one saving grace, and theon and lyanna were both satisfying deaths, at least. aside from that...game of thrones, what happened to you?"
2019-04-29,yobrotherwtf,wtf?,9,"incredible,beyond words in the epic scope--but wtf was with the lighting in episode 3 season 8? it was like 90 minutes of watching a black screen. if the trenches weren't alight, dothraki swords ablaze, or dragon fire being spewed i literally couldn't tell wtf was going on. do the editors only watch the final product on some super hd screen instead of a regular desktop/tv? this was the most frustrating and disappointing experience of something i have been looking forward to for ...nearly a decade. the series gets 9/10 this episode gets a 2."
2019-04-29,emiliaszekely,Great,6,everything is well through and you can get attached to the characters easily.
2019-04-29,jezzasworld,An insult to the Golden Age of Television,4,"stood alone, this episode was a moderately entertaining action film. stood in context to the entire series, it was utterly appalling. in fact, the whole season so far has been a complete misunderstanding of what made this series so great.a common remark made of the early series was that despite being a fantasy series, it was the most realistic show on tv. now it's become the very antithesis of its old modus operandi. it resembles a below-par marvel film in its abundance of corny callbacks, melodramatic reunions and bombastic yet dull action sequences.what was once mature subversiveness has been replaced with infantile predictability. how can the writers expect any mildly intelligent viewer to be on the edge of the seats when every main character has invincible plot armour.?about halfway through, you have 90% of the show's main characters all trapped inside winterfell about to die. and we've been told the episode before that killing the nk automatically wins the battle. and we're supposed to be shocked at the end?? and you'd at least want the big bad of the series to be, if not overwhelmed by force, to be outsmarted or to have some clever tactic or gambit - not today. arya jumps out and stabs him. the end.perhaps there will be a great sacrifice to defeat this apocalyptic threat that has been hyped up for eight seasons? nope. the only deaths were inconsequential, and these characters had finished their arcs long long ago.the writers have entirely missed the point of what makes this the golden age of television. breaking bad and the sopranos haven't won awards for their budget-defying explosions and cheesy one-liners. what makes these shows so brilliant is the focused characterisation, the sophistication of the plot and the depth of the moral themes.what's the moral of this episode? ""stick them with the pointy end""?"
2019-04-29,parsakarami,Absolutely brilliant,8,"all of sence is brilliant, the battle is so stressful and beautiful"
2019-04-29,shayhaq,This show turned to sopa opera after season 4,10,"the writing went downhill after they ran out of material the latest season 8 seems like it was written by a 6 year old too predictable and cliche, super disappointing dont waste your time watching this show. i learned it the hard way after having spent 10years on this show. i feel sorry for the cast, their efforts are overshadowed by the poor sctipts of the writters."

2019-04-30,rickikristensen,Most epic episode in television history,5,"this is my first ever review on imdb, but after reading all the negative comments of the ""the long night"" i thought i had to express myself.how this is not a clear 10/10 for everyone, is to me a mystery.i have never seen a better setup against such a crucial point in a series. the way we, during season 8's first two episodes, feels the characters fear and hopelessness, just makes this section even more nerve,wracking.several reviews criticizing, that our beloved main characters miraculously survive time and time again, indicating that the authors do not have the courage to kill them. but then you need to ask yourself: why should they not dare so? there's nothing to lose. we (sadly) only have 3 episodes left of the most brilliant series at all time and after that, we are going to ""lose"" jon, dany, aya and all the others for good anyway.this is game of thrones, folks - wake up now!. i'm sure that the writers have more epic and surprising things in store for us."

2019-05-06,n-58017,season 8 ruined all the characters,9,hoping george r.r martin take part in this show. d.b have destroyed souls of all the characters. the crews are superficial. got can be much better than this. so disappointed.
2019-05-06,aelskwork,got review,10,"as an avid reader, i am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. i initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. for whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content.so when i saw the preview for ""game of thrones"" on hbo, i was immediately skeptical. oh, i was going to watch it, but i didn't have high expectations. i did hold a little hope because hbo is known for their high quality shows."
2019-05-06,fameurs,Game of clones,9,"every single character we once loved still looks the same on the outside, but there's nothing left of them on the inside. i expected the quality of the story and dialogue to suffer somewhat for obvious reasons, but did anyone think it could sink to this level? it looks like the screenplay was based upon watching a bunch of toddlers play with got action figures for an afternoon.let's all just wait patiently for george rr martin to finish and then start a petition for a remake of the last season."
2019-05-07,jules-37803,"The writers really let themselves, their audience & Martin down...",10,"the first 5 seasons of game of thrones are exceptional, a beautifully structured series. the sets, characters, pacing, twists , exceptional. i could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.when it came to season 5, the author of the books (george r. r. martin) and hbo had a disagreement. martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. hbo declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. the books & george's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.this brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. the first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since season 1. i tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as ""bigger than helms deep"" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. if you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. i will not stem into this too much, but basically dan & dave chose to go down the hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which i was hoping would redeem the final season.the writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. i am still going to watch until the end, but i thought i would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series."
2021-07-29,mm-41448,SO close to perfection!,4,"seasons 1,6 were simply amazing! season 7 is where it started to go a bit downhill, but it was still pretty good. and then... *sigh*... then came season 8. i can't believe the directors decided to do such things in the final season. the characters were ruined. don't even get me started on plot. and in season 8 logic wasn't even a thing anymore. i'd give seasons 2, 4 and 6 a 10/10, seasons 1, 3 and 5 a 9/10, season 7 a 7/10 and season 8 a 4.5/10."

2019-05-12,selversea,Greatest show ever degrades to biggest disappointment ever,1,"arguably once greatest show of all time, adapted from the exceptional novels of ice and fire written by george r r martin, game of thrones has fallen flat. the dialogue between characters with exceptional wit, such as tyrian and varys, has turned to the caliber of fart and dick jokes the moment the directors ran out of books to reference. if the spectacle of special effects and spoon fed tropes are all you're after, you will likely still be satisfied with seasons 7 and 8. if you cared about how the show was written from the beginning, you will likely find the youtube rants about how bad it sucks now far more entertaining than the actual show. rip game of thrones."

2019-05-16,alimdhwsh,Iraq-Baghdad,10,"game of thrones the most greatest series i have ever seen and, i will see it on tv. it was a show of suspense and dramatic drama that make you expected most of the episode of all seasons and heroes who feel that you are part of them and the story and feel yourself in the middle of the plot."
2019-05-16,aymanzwain,best tv show ever,10,best tv show serise 😍😍😍😍💜............................
2019-05-16,beeferbill,Sadly disappointing end to what had been greatest show ever,7,"i never thought another show could replace lord of the rings or breaking bad as my favorite shows ever. however, got quickly replaced them and has been my greatest addiction ever since. and it is because i love(d)this show so much that it literally pains me to see how catastrophically they have botched and butchered its final season. it began with the battle of winterfell, and the show has been in a tailspin ever since. others have already elaborated the reasons for why that is. i just think it very sad to so poorly end what had been such a great show for 7 seasons. i will not degrade my seasons 1 through 7 blu,rays collection with those from this final season. they're not something i'd enjoy rewatching as i have the others..."
2019-05-16,vivekkishanmech,Lost,9,"game of thrones is lost in season 8 as in ending of lost series;) season 1,5: 10/10

2019-05-16,ivjelena,Things we do for money,10,"they underestimate their audience with focusing on sensation never mind if you destroy the characters on the way, very insulting"
2019-05-22,jayseanzzgirl,Not Enough Jack Black,7,"do not know why but i felt like jack black needed to be in this show. hahaha nah but seriously the first few seasons were ok then it really started picking up towards season 7 and then season 8 was like giving the audience blue balls for setting up all these lore, legends, and traditions only to throw them out the window. sure it was fascinating to see the destruction of an entire empire by a dragon and see the iron throne standing alone in a broken room, but when you throw out the basis of the entire story and the development of characters, it felt like a huge waste of time. if it were not for the lovable characters and actors with their hard work, i would have rated lower.
still would have liked a jack black cameo lol."

2019-05-20,ohoh-48412,So disappointed,7,"it's suck season 8, so disappointed! it was good 1,7 season!
but final episode so suck!"
2019-05-21,kiumarsaryana,Worst ending ever!,9,i loved this show before seeing the last 3 episodes of 8th season. such a disappointment!
2019-05-20,starscrean-47870,Now what will I do,10,"this show ruined it for me. now my expectations will be high. i hope there will be a show good as got. character were likable. story line great. acting superb. best show i've ever seen. sopranos being second. even the cgi dragon, writers and story made you feel what was being portrayed. i will always love this show. i wanted daenerys to set on the thrown. my favorite, her and her dragons."
2019-05-20,pdgcribeiro,Goodbye my friend.,10,"the hardest ending to make in the history of television. this season had it share of mistakes, but is not as bad as people are pointing... we just have high expectations for the best fantasy series of all time.
episode 6 was great in my opinion, it gave a good and solid closure to the series:,the wheel was broken and bran de broken is the king! and the best possible king, one you can't trick and with a an higher sense of justice, without feelings getting in the way.
-jon snow put honor aside one second time an went to where he was happier.
-arya, has she previously shared, wanted to know what is west of westeros. a frodo baggins ending for our hero.
-sansa is the queen in the north. she deserves it.
-we could see tyrion and bronn together again. that was nice.
-brienne had a great ending writing the deeds of jamie :).a bittersweet ending as promised.
and i loved the way tyrion said the moral of the books/story to jon by explaining dany arc. it was amazing.in my opinion the problem was that they rushed the series to be unpredictable and it felt strange. it was to fast , we needed more episodes in season 7 and 8 to really go deep on dany and jon relationship for the murder to have more impact.nonetheless i had a blast this years and i am sorry for everyone who couldn't enjoy it. this series is magnificent and i can't wait for the books.ps: the visual effects and the music in this series was minblowing!"
2019-05-20,gabriella_a226,"So close, yet so far",10,"seasons 1,6 are the most phenomenal television i have ever seen, and i will continue to say this is my favorite show. the cast, cinematography, and writing (to be continued) is incredible. these factors leave you greatly invested in the storyline so much that the last two seasons are really a knife to the heart. so much beautiful set up is betrayed by sloppy writing, rushed plots, and corny outcomes: things you would never expect to see in a show of this impecability. however, with the absolute trash writing that comes with season 7 and 8, the cast never loses their touch. one can truly see what a talented bunch of actors are present in this show when they must completely switch their characters without much room for transition. with the boring dialogue and cheesy scenes, these actors maintain their dignity and great work. this show was always ten stars for me but this final season, especially, led me to remove 4 stars and that is being extremely generous. it feels as if all this investment, all the prophecies, all the preparation present in this show was wasted on that ending. the final episode tried so hard to create a twist that it made little sense and tied no loose ends. the only character development and storyline that followed through was sansa's and that is probably the only part of this season that kept me watching. very disappointed in how the writers spent so much time delivering a perfect nearly complete gift only to put a silly little bow on top of it before it was even packaged properly."
2019-05-20,literocola,I waited until the final episode to write a review,10,"i happened upon this series in season 1 episode 1 and was hooked from s1,s4. this is a fantastic show rich with character growth and unforgettable world building. the introduction of magic & prophecies had me skeptical but the rich story and top notch acting kept me engaged.as the show grew, as did production values - yet still, even in seasons 5 & 6, the roots of the original 4 seasons showed through and still delivered good character interaction.however by season 5, the source material has dried up and the 'showrunners' must produce by cliffnotes. this is when dialogue turns to ash in your mouth and great leaps are made in storytelling to get characters where they need to be for the next plot point.by seasons 7 & 8 the show is clearly leapfrogging its way to the end game - making major plot compromises to create the conflict and storyline they are looking for.while the books remain to be published and redeem this storyline, perhaps providing some sensible storytelling - this show is amongst one of the most poorly concluded series of all time."
2019-05-20,kashifmiller,GOT Finale,1,"i would like to express my disappointment from your unsatisfactory level of service. i have expected much more from a prestigious and reputed tv show of your standard. unfortunately, i can't help but submit this letter of disappointment hoping for a fast and adequate explanation and apology...i hope you agree with me that this is not acceptable under any circumstances. i trust that you will deal with this issue in a top urgent fashion. i also trust that you will take the necessary precautions to prevent such incidents in the future.thank you for everything got"
2019-05-20,kalhusainyka,It's for sure the best TV series ever exist.,1,"even though season 8 isn't as good as the rest seasons, the ending was very good and thoughtful."
2019-05-20,cedarlynndobbin,"Extremely relevant and important message. WOW, GOT!",10,"to all involved in the making of game of thrones: wow. just wow. what an incredibly symbolic and relevant message to end on.if elected leaders of our world were as spiritually woke;
enlightened; and
ego,conscious as ""bran the broken""; ""the 3-eyed raven"", world peace would be within reach, as it is now for the 7 kingdoms. decisions are often made unconsciously in our world, and that is our greatest fault.got, you resonated with my soul, and so eloquently planted seeds for your record audience of over 18 million. the timing could not be more critical for a lesson as deeply rooted as this.phenomenal writing, directing, acting, effects, everything. what a fantastic end to a brilliant franchise.this is my first time writing a review on imdb. i was strongly compelled to express my interpretation."
2019-05-20,lascarmonty,The finale and season 8 is a knife through my heart.,10,"this series will remain one of my favorite ever but the ending was poorly done. i would even say, laughable.we all wanted either snow to be king or at least arya...it used to be surprises after surprises. jon killing his queen after episode 5 was no surprise and the mere fact that the creators of the show made us hate someone we use to love and almost truly believe in... was just terrible.they have tried to make the series end on a good note but while doing this they have destroyed the show piece by piece."
2019-05-20,recorithlegend,Subvert your expectations,1,anything after season 6 is just bad. season 8 was a waste and lack of anything remotely cathartic. it's one thing to try to subvert expectations but you have to have to writing to back it up. but hey i guess it doesn't matter when you get tapped for a disney project right?
2020-08-03,dhuliaabhilash,Rest in peace you once magnificent beauty,10,i can't say anything more than what has been said by fellow fans. i a rating it as a 6/10 for the 6 seasons that actually made sense. season 7 was the beginning of the end and season 8 was the final nail in the coffin.
2019-05-20,sjadm-93805,The last episode of the greatest series in history,7,"the last episode of the eighth season was very, very, very, very bad, john snow did not get anything in the end and the love of life has died, when i watched this episode i cried very hard on john snow"
2019-05-20,asem-72278,The last season is bad . The last season is bad,10,the last season is bad . the last season is bad . the last season is bad
2019-05-20,boshmais-16682,Best tv show ever,10,the best show that more than 1 season ever. the story and the crew and everything is great.
2019-05-20,stil_d,This rating is caused by the huge disappointment after the last season,9,"i was a big fan of game of thrones ever since it first aired on hbo. however, after waiting for two years, i (as probably also a lot of others) felt that the season didn't rise up the rest of the show. i believe the writers and producers didn't do the show justice and rushed the story. in these 6 episodes and pretty much destroyed most of the major character lines. it took 7 seasons for these complex story lines to evolve, just to be shattered in 2 episodes. that being said, taking in consideration that season 8 is a part of got, i don't believe anymore that the show deserves the 9.5 stars."
2019-05-20,lifeishard-38266,The best show ever,9,all the episodes are perfect.anyone who says otherwise is just a hater and really doesn't know tv that well
2019-05-20,r-vass,And now our watch has ended...,1,"stannis baratheon once said, ""a good act does not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good."" and ultimately, that is how i feel about this show. the good moments do not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good. it's a show about complex characters in complex situations, and my attitude toward the show has become complex too (most especially in the last two seasons) , yet i still believe it's a masterpiece in its own right, when looked at as a whole.having watched the entire show now, i can say with certainty this is still one of the greatest shows i have ever seen. i've watched a lot of tv, and few shows have gotten me as captivated and invested as got. of course, the downside to my investment was that i was inevitably disappointed - but i knew that would happen no matter what. season 8 felt rushed yet slow at the same time, and didn't have any single moment that completely mesmerized or stunned me like in previous seasons (such as the red wedding, the mountain and the viper, hardhome, the last two episodes of season 6, etc.). but then again, i still enjoyed the final season for what it is, and understand why it ended the way it did. if i had written this show, sure there are many things i would have changed. i would have loved to see the white walker storyline extend, i would have loved to see dany go mad a while back but ultimately find some sort of redemption....but as the original 3 eyed raven once said, ""the past is already written, the ink is dry."" this show is over. and we knew all along this show wouldn't have a ""happy ending."" for a story as complex as got, there is no easy way to wrap it all up.in the end, i fell in love with game of thrones because it completely immersed me in a world with fantastical elements, but with very real emotions. a world that completely took me away from my everyday woes - it's sheer escapism. the acting, set design, special effects, music, and atmosphere are breathtaking and have given me countless hours of enjoyment and entertainment. i've never felt so emotionally invested in a show! and for that, i am glad i first started my watch back in 2013, and am now sad that my watch has now ended."
2019-05-20,smithdamian-55483,Worst TV show ending ever !!! Don't watch it,3,wasted last 10 years i invested in this show. worst e ding i have ever seen in tv series history. complete bs
2019-05-20,vinaychaubeyhere,Best of lifetime,10,"i enjoyed the uncertainty. there are always hopes,dreams, thoughts,decisions,mistakes and so many other things in life but uncertainty always prevails. things we love and things we agree. got is the thing i agree. because they have been true to nature of human not expectations of human.
mature would agree to ending but would be hated by immature, either way it's not gonna be loved. and that's the perfect ending of a show."
2019-05-20,joselinmx,This season is horrible,1,"long live the queen, thanks also for ruining everybody's arc lol how even bran is going to become the kingdom? kid did t do crap the whole show also how you even going to listen to a prisoner and how jon still alive with tyrion after betraying their queen, we only stan drogon, greyworm and yara"

2019-05-20,devutintu,Worst season ever : season 8,10,"idk why they took whole two years for making such a simple ending. the making, vfx, sfx was good still it made me give 1/10 to this season. such a disappointment. predictable events, plain storyline, haven't given importance to many characters. the overall rating should be lower (7/10) max 🙄"

2019-05-20,sasa_ma_sasa,One of the best shows in history,10,"the emotions, the drama, the suspense, the solidity of words, the amazing cast, the good writing, the magnificent production, the animations, the accuracy, the spontaneous events, and the roles of the helping cast.... all of this ,and more- makes this show unprecedented. i don't know if we'll ever have a show like game of thrones. masterpiece."

NO - it's unrewatchable,10,"i used to recommends a lot of my friends to watch got.. but after the final season/episode, it shattered everything. poor writing, and it's just trash in the end. i just unsubscribed my hbo.would you recommend ur friends to watch got again? f.ck nowould you re,watch this series again, like you used to previously?
f.ck no"
2019-05-20,zaidalmomani-68842,D&D dumb and dumber,10,the last season has destroyed the whole story that we have been watching since years!!!! daenerys's haircut is more complicated than the text of season 8!!!! wtf
2019-05-20,yusufozen-04468,Ruined show,10,i hope these directors never get a big gig again. they absolutely butchered one of the greatest shows of all time. they should never have been blessed to direct this show to begin with.
2019-05-20,jonherbs12,Don't let the hate on season 8 sway you,7,"i've been an avid consumer of got since it was first introduced to me five years ago. i want to commend the work done by every actor / actress and member of production staff on creating a truly generational piece. that being said, the recent hate on the final season seems unjust to me, as most negativity stems from the series not concluding how they (the viewer) wanted it to conclude. this is the exact reason why i loved it. making predictions is one thing, but hating a show you've claimed to love because it didn't fulfill your wishes is not justified. i loved the final season just as much as the previous ones. it was the duty of everyone involved to try and execute an amazing show such as this and many loved it. sometimes duty is the death of love."
2019-05-20,mehrdadibameri,sad!,5,"i do not think that this is a bad thing. i think the director just wanted to finish the series quickly, and he did not consider the psychological aspect of the people at all, despite being one of the best television tv series and many viewers!"
2019-05-20,mohamadmgt,A big story is a failed end,10,"i missed the years of work in this series, which was wonderful but the end is disappointing"
2019-05-20,naxxed,This show,10,"sucked but if that was not enough, because technically it isn't for this review, i'd like to reiterate the overhype and suck,ness of this show.
thank you."
2019-05-20,barrymai,the final ruined the show 😥,10,"the whole season 8 being rushed for being only 6 episodes made bad impact to the show for being to short and cant put all two wars in just 6 episode's that just impassable , dead vs alive war being filmed so dark that it impossible to watch , and last war being just dragon crushing whole castle like birthday cake is dumb."
2019-05-20,hanjincao,"Fantasy, but a true picture of real life, emotion, politics...",10,it's a phenomenal epic in the world. enough said. i loved this series so much.
2019-05-20,li-66561,Last season is a complete disaster,9,there are so much logical mistakes and dumb things in last season...i have no words to describe my disappointment... last season is a complete disaster but last episode of season 8 just a nonsense and bs
2019-05-20,userfehler,Messed up with Seasons 7 and especially 8,10,"up until season 5/6 i would have given 10 stars, then it got worse and season 8 was a complete disaster. i'm ending with an average of 7."
2019-05-20,hanna_shamout,The lasr season is so bad,5,the last episode was so so bad. i expacted more then that.
2019-05-20,angeloftheshore-61533,7 for 7 out of 8 seasons,10,"it's not that i didn't like the how the it played out, it's how rushed it all seemed after years of character development. it took years to get them where they stood in season 8, and then everything was so abrupt. yes daenerys was heading in that direction, we saw since season 4. but something was very off with the way it unfolded. even season 7 seemed rushed. it's sad really. the show was amazing for 6 seasons though!"
2019-05-20,faarhadkabir,Game of Thrones,9,great season throughout!! but a poor finale and finale episode!! very poorly written.

2019-05-25,hakanaiyumetd,Amazing show from beginning to end!,9,"despite what all the whiners are saying, i enjoyed the last season. if you've already read the books, just treat the show as a different thing all it's own and the changes won't bother you."
2019-05-20,ervanhoy,Great Series,1,"wonderful show, you will get attached to characters and develop your own opinion of how the series should end so try not to be butt hurt when it doesn't turn out like you'd hoped. ✌🏻"
2019-05-20,gavjohnston,Season 8 ruined Game of Thrones,7,"before season 8 i loved game of thrones but the writers truly screwed up. i feel game of thrones has been going downhill since season 6 when they had no source material ( a song of ice and fire) but it has truly fallen this last season with apparent lack of money clearly affecting the plot despite them being offered more money by hbo which is seen when rhaegal is killed easily by cerseis scorpions while daenarys casually flys over the iron fleet which i believe is for production reasons and then at king landing the scorpions are clearly nerfed with it taking longer to reload and horrible accuracy. also ghosts farewell in episode 4 was lacking in emotion which the director david nutter said was due to it being expensive and time consuming, sorry for your trouble. i could rant forever but before season 8 i would probably have rated it a 6 and before season 6 it would be 10 ultimately this is the writers doing and they certainly don't deserve a star wars trilogy ryan johnson has done enough to ruin star wars never mind these guys."
2019-05-20,lenehaugstad,Worst ending ever - Don't waste your time,8,i just finished the last season...i did to mind episode 5 like many others did but the last episode made me feel like i wasted 8 years of my life on this show. worst ending in the history of endings.
2019-05-21,georgiosjorge,Last two episodes is bad end destroy all series,8,lot of question still stay open. who wants such a quick ending of great story? ppl already said main problems in storyline i wont repeat it. bad bad bad bad end. ok good choice for the king. but bad explanation of everything else. sorry but you just dont deserve more than 8. i will gove you one star.
2019-05-21,mani555,Love GOT but worst ending.,10,dany deserved the throne. atleast they should have turned her mad queen slowly and logically rather than being rushed.
2019-05-21,khupzamang,Excellent story ruined by the final season.,10,"season 1 to 5 : 10/10 season 6&7 : 8/10
season 8 : 3/10.
hence the aggregate rating 7/10."
2019-07-23,uffaq,Worst ending ever........writters spoiled 1 chance to achieve glory of a lifetime.......such a shame,10,couldn't have gone worse with ending.....writters had a chance of once in a lifetime to create masterpiece but they ruined it in the worst possible way
2019-05-21,haoduoduo,Dispointing,10,"it was a really amazing tv show i have never watched before. however, the final ruined this legend show. so disappointe, will never watch any hbo products from now."
2019-05-21,cabrett-11657,Terrible ending to a good show,10,"did dany have a brain tumor? all of a sudden one of the show's main protagonists decides to slaughter people indiscriminitely. maybe the show spent so much energy on those epic battle scenes that they were too tired for any thoughtful character development. i only read the spoilers for the show's final episode and if there was another season i would not watch it. the only good thing about the final season was the battle scenes, no thank you."
2019-05-21,mmq-02263,"The best show, but the ending was the worst",10,"the ending was absolutely not logical, i was really sad that this great show ended this way."
2019-05-21,slema-22626,S8 the worst,1,was the greatest until s8 the worst of all time came is this author thinking ever that people will not accept such a bad end and scenario
2019-05-21,xronoman,Ingenious,10,"let me start by saying i created this account only to enlighten the haters of season 8. ask yourselves why is bran king? well maybe the story tellers know a lot about bran then all of us. maybe bran is the lawful heir to the throne , and you will see why in the prequel of the new show next year! there are no loose ends , everyone is happy in the end and the storytellers found a way to make millions with the next show! who wins? well we all do cause we will get a chance to see how it all started!"
2019-05-21,rattler-03569,Bad movements,9,"far from telling producers how to make a series, as i can't do it myself, so far the seasons where very well done, but the last season was very disappointing, given the long night not to be seen unless you put up your display a notch, or this season ending where ther are still two books waiting to be published, i think some people have missed a possibility to get worldfamous. have they earned so much money that they are allowed to ignore their public?
good luck with that, but i'm sure they will get enough reactions to proove otherwise."

2019-05-21,llamsrjsrm,"Great book and series, terrible final season",8,"the critique is not to do with the final fates of character. instead it's with the overall production of the final season. it's as if they changed directors, editors, and writers. season 8 had novice filming mistakes, timing and overall all flown issues. it was a gravely disappointing end product. we're all left to day dream how we'd have done it differently. now if george r. r. martin would ever get to finishing the written series, we might get a consistent to the text, quality ending. please finish. mr. martin. please."
2019-05-21,bluehawaiian,Game of Thrones! Thanks for everything!,7,"in my opinion, this unique series, despite the last season 'legendary series' was able to enter. game of thrones, thank you for all the beautiful moments you've made us through 8 seasons. you will never be forgotten!"

2019-05-21,sarakhalid-68650,One Of The Greatest Shows Ever !!,10,"despite the unfortunate ending.. i loved every season from 1,7 but maybe the last season had a bad writing but that doesn't make the show disappointing.. i know d&d had other plans for the show unlike george rr martin but he even said that the ending is similar .. but don't judge the whole series by just not liking the ending .. i didn't think it was the best but its reasonable and a lot of people found it satisfying .. i find it very upsetting that the show's rating just went down.. this is very ridiculous and this is actually my first time ever writing a review because this is an injustice for their hard work that they put!!"
2021-09-25,irfanraja-98892,All time favorite,4,"love all the characters, theme and everything is well visualised. 💝"
2019-05-22,fatemaalmosawi-29677,💔,10,it was a nice episode put there are some bad feeling because it finish
2019-05-22,lianwu,Epic show that spoiled me,1,"despite the final season which had some questionable choices, i did enjoy the last season on its own. of course it was not as good as the all the seasons before it, but overall, i believe got is still the best tv show ever. my only wish is that got could have gotten a green light for 10 seasons or even more (actually, never wanted it to end)."
2019-05-22,akramreyez,Best show ever but the ending was disapointed,10,all seasons were great only season 8 because the ending don't make sens and also bran don't deserve to be a king and danny's death was horrible and the way that area killed the night king was really bad
2019-05-22,wyllt,Welp,10,"didn t watch the last season, guess i ll be dissapointed?"
2019-05-22,jameshirst-93789,SHAME!,10,"what was in line to be the greatest show ever made decided to jump off a cliff, such an awful final season ruined the entire franchise for me.i wont be reading the last books or watching any of the spin offs, shame on you dan and dave and shame on you hbo!"
2019-05-22,mikehcsus,.....and then Season 8 happened,9,"the only thing separating this show from being the greatest of all time is the awful 6 episode conclusion that we waited 2 years for.unfortunately this show will get thrown into the pile with lost, true blood, how i met your mother and many others that were fantastic and were done in by horrible endings."
2019-05-22,trezeluas,"The Best Series, The Worst Ending",10,"certainly one of the best series ever made. great actors, characters, episodes, visual effects, impeccable costumes, and 3 dragons. but the end, the end is one of the worst ever in a series. it's a shame that the writers and producers have not been able to do something worthy of the story of the characters, and that everything has ended this way.
but still worth watching.
now i'm going to read all the books, and i hope that r.r. martin does not die before writing the end of the saga."
2019-05-22,nr-47706,Awesome,1,"masterpiece, they will be nothing like this again!"
2019-05-22,mohammadadnanbh,Season 1 to 7 Great...... Season 8 Worst of all,1,"if you want to watch this series. please watch it for the the first 7 seasons, because the 8th and final season is the worst ending to a great story line."
2019-05-26,bekapsr,Almost best show ever.,1,"amazing plot, quality dialogues, twists, acting, and best music ever for five seasons. quality drop a little in 6th season, but still great season. 7th season not on pair with previous, but for me still a good season. then came 8th season, a finale. the less i said the better. ruined everything that was done before. rushed, it was like watching on 8x. dialogues were adopted for little kids to understand. 50% of storytelling which was important for 7 season, turn out to be irellevant, which made everything done before useless. shame. it could be best series ever made."
2019-05-23,sajadaltaee-46857,Greatest of all time,10,the best series ever but only the ending was kind of bad
2019-05-23,marekhishavadze,game of thrones,1,it's amazing !! the finale was a surprise. i liked it very much
2019-05-23,salomejgharkava,got is the best soap opera in thi world,10,i love all. you ar the best peple.i love so so mucha. good luck
2019-05-23,jeffmuchiri,Great series horrible ending,10,the series is great throughout the 6 seasons but things start to change in season 7. season 8 is unbearable.
2019-05-23,arryyoung,A masterpiece with a rushed ending,10,"game of thrones has been my favourite show ever since i got a few episodes into the first season, in episode 9 of season 1 the series cemented itself as a true masterpiece. game of thrones successfully juggles an incredibly impressive amount of characters and stories and every single one is compelling and interesting in its own way. the directing, cinematography, acting, music and writing (minus season 8) is all top notch. this series had an unbelievable first 6 seasons, season 7 felt like a step down but was still extremely interesting thanks to the interactions of daenerys targaryen and jon snow however season 8 is where the show falters, the final 3 episodes take at least 2 seasons of content and try to cram it into 3 episodes and the show suffers because of it. contrary to what some might say i believe the ending actually makes perfect sense however the problem is how they get there, the story should've been given more time to develop to the end. overall, game of thrones is a must,see show and despite a poor finish it is my all time favourite fictional story and i would encourage anyone to give it a try."
2019-05-24,ahmedelzokra,The Greatest TV Show Ever Made,1,"i loved the show so much. it is by far the greatest tv show ever made, and no other tv show can be compared to it.game of thrones was brilliant in many aspects, in terms of cinematography, story, acting, and sound effects.i had a whole new experience with the show, that i never had with any other shows, including history stories from the books, fan theories, and reaction videos. basically, the amount of material available about the show is impressive.i know many fans got upset by season 8 and especially the ending of the show. but, i personally knew this would happen since the producers david and dan, (whom without them the show wouldn't exist) decided to overpass the books. even though the quality of writing has dropped since then but the show is still better than any other shows, and i respect all the decisions they took and the hard work of everyone who was involved in the making of the show.thanks to gorge r. r. martin for making this amazing world with all the brilliant storylines and plots, which took more than 20 to be this great and made game of thrones so special and hard if not impossible to be replaced."
2019-05-24,abachos,What could of been.,10,"this show had amazing potential. it had the chance to be the greatest show of all time. it was disappointing to see so many great character arcs destroyed by the rushed writing of season 8. overall, it is a great show but the last season has definitely ruined it for me."
2019-05-24,fabbrolus,Disappointed,8,"best series of all time. until the last season. plot line was rushed. character developments were destroyed. plot lines cheaply tied off or forgotten. equivalent of lord of the rings characters reaching mordor , then a asteroid hits and blows up the world."
2019-05-24,shepherdb-34963,Best show I've ever seen,9,even including season 8 it is the greatest show ever.
2019-05-24,clarkk-64683,Seasons 1-7 great! Season 8 good but not great,6,"i think the earlier seasons were definitely better but one of my favourite episodes is in season 7 'spoils of war'. found season 8 to be good but nowhere as good as previous seasons, many stories lines that were significant were never explained or mentioned or seemingly 'forgotten'. s8 also to me felt very rushed, there was no need to cram everything into 6 episodes, and the final episode just didn't sit right with me at all. i just was left feeling very disappointed after following this programme right from the start as an avid fan."
2019-05-24,aradchenkov,wonderful series,9,"in my opinion this is a wonderful series, which fascinated with its history. yes, no one could ever imagine such an ending"
2019-05-24,mustaphabokri,Best TV série ever,10,"i watched the show since 2013. i love everything about it.
the music is lovely."
2019-05-24,raoufadel-06917,Character build up,8,"game of thrones season 1 , 6 was amazing, in terms of more than just storyline, but the individual character build-up leading to an almost perfect series, this continues in season 7 with an approach focusing more on the ""white walkers"" which had a potential to end properly in the final season, however the ""final battle"" ended in episode 3 with a disappointing knife kill which leaves out so many characters that could have also been part of defeating such a strong enemy that ""threatened"" the seven kingdoms only to be seen die with a stab. later on we see danny taking her father's side and becoming the ""mad queen"" burning down the city and claims to continue ""liberating"" other cities which i personally see as a terrible character build up and the worst way to end a story, jon snow's kill has lead to his return to the nights watch giving very little use to the fact that he's actually a ""targaryan"" especially that no-one knew. putting brandon stark ""three eyed raven"" could have been a good ending if adapting the story for him to earn the throne, hoever his sudden nomination from ""tyrion"" makes no sense and the dialogue before was even more annoying.
summing this up, i believe that season 8 was very disappointing, it feels rushed and develops a very poor storyline."
2019-05-24,deshen-17102,Great show - Stop watching at season 7,10,"as the title says , all the previous reviews and accolades speak for themselves.but do not watch season 8 you will ruin the entire show , as many other loyal viewers found out the hard way."
2019-05-24,unid-89747,Magnificent,1,"it's just out of this world, it has a really good plot, amd dialogue, 10/10 easily"
2021-06-19,sunitaagrawal-07735,So Addictive,9,no doubt it is the best show or series ever made.you can't stop thinking about it. maybe the ending is quite disappointing but the whole show is best you will ever see.
2019-05-25,karanch-34068,God of series,9,"got is the greatest show ever created on this planet, its like its a god of series. 1 thing every got viewer knows is tht there is not a single series tht can compete with got right,now or in future not even *breaking-bad* or twd or *vikings*, if you doubt this review, then go watch by yourself, n i net u ll say n believe wat i am saying rn."
2019-05-25,jacobmc-26753,Overall a great series,10,"from the first episode until the last i was addicted to game of thrones, although the ending was rushed and could have done with a extra couple episodes or even a season more the series had a great cast and storyline worth watching."
2019-05-25,amberfall-23830,"Failed, warning SpOiLeRs.",9,"tbh... just finished game of thrones. i feel like it was a failed ending like how i met your mother. there was so much character building it seems to have been wasted and also both wars felt and seemed rushed through.what was the point of jon's true name? arya had an amazing ability.
why did dany have to follow her family foot steps?so much character building has been thrown out."
2019-05-27,jacobedowell,Game of thrones is rubbish,10,"watched this show as i'm a series fanatic and all the talk about it thought gee this must be at least half decent, i think there is probably 10 scenes max i actually enjoyed. the storyline is good yeah, but the writing is absolutely atroshtious this could have been written over a 4 season series and you'd still know just as much as you do over 8, dragged out scenes and pointless scenes just to gain more air time equalling more money.this is the equivalent of writing a high school essay, not having enough words so that it meets the minimum requirement.wake up hbo , thank god that chernobyl has come along to make up for wasting 70+ hours of my life."
2019-05-25,krossow-08865,Best TV show of our generation,4,"d&d did a great job adapting the books to a tv series. unfortunately it had to come to an end. people are upset that it ended, and didn't end the way they wanted. the show keeps you interested all the way until the last scene"
2019-05-26,dakodamcgee,Overall,10,"when comparing game of thrones to any other show, theres been nothing like it. no show that has affected pop culture, and society like it. no show with as much complexity. when starting the show, i was never into shows that delt with medieval times, now i'm almost obsessed. no show has captured so much of my thought life and emotions. it had a rough landing, but over all, the show was revolutionary, and it'll be hard to make anything like it again. you love what you think about. i'm sad it's over."
2019-05-26,svdvmxwl,Ends Are frustrating and don't even think about Justifying a bit of story line.,10,"no logical connection for many characters and their changes and deaths. i hated the final season more than i loved first 5. 6,7 are okayish.
""they made a beautiful art and dumped it in sewage and presented it on art show."""
2019-05-26,monelking,..,10,"it was really a masterpiece, season 1:7 was so great, the develop of characters was really good, how they got every thing connected and they made everything perfectly right about that, till that weird season 8 which i see was very rushed as every one else, they kinda forgot about logic through this season . and the last episode was so bad that i didn't feel any emotion during the whole episode, specially dany's scene. but still i rate the show on the first 7 seasons"
2019-05-26,nawfsubaie,Amazing but!,10,the show amazing up to seaon 7 least season 8 was horrible bad writing and the story doesn't make any sense
2019-05-28,abinagp,"Power, Sorrow, Anger, Right, Empathy, Love, Betrayal",9,"a tv show that had gone more popular even in between keralites. i'm a great fan f game of thrones. it shows how to be wise in taking decisions that may change your life. if you pick each and everything, it won't end. this show bought up some courage in my mind. the scenes that describes 'betrayal' is common to everyone's life. someone may betray you without getting any notice who had done this.
i'm a great emilia clarke fan now after this show. i had watched her movies and i likes her acting.
till season 7 it was fantastic and the final season was little boring and the fans didn't get what they expected.
i also wanted a remake of season 8.
most of my friends hated this show only because of the final season. there's nothing to blame them.
many have read theories that could happen and nothing had happen as mentioned in any of the theory, that's the reason why they are so upset on season finale."
2019-05-26,madisonneaton-48286,A Perfect Show (Mostly),10,the first six seasons are so perfect that they make up for the 7th and 8th season mishaps.
2019-09-05,sandinira,"It was a great show, But ending suck😭",10,"i don't think lot of fans complain about the ending becouse it didn't go as they hope it to be. but because it was so damn redeules, like they just fed up writing it and needed to finish it up because they had to. shame it was soooo good. may be writers were not good as we all thought they were"
2019-05-28,adsad-76844,Disappointing seasson,10,i think if there will be any series from got had to be the director is george r r martinbut the first 6 seasons is really good
2019-05-28,uchihasoheab,It sucks,10,"this show is the worst i have seen in ages, i rather watch dora the explorer because it's literal trash."
2019-05-28,jerrrrrrrysaaks,Used to be so good................ what happened.............,10,"when it started, game of thrones was one of the most stunning and cinematic television series ever. the scope was breathtaking, the fights were exciting yet realistic, the characters were complex, the acting was great, and the writing was fantastic. it was one of the most shocking shows on television and you never knew who would die next! it was great.but then season 8 happened.i'm willing to defend the first half of the season. yes, even ""the long night"", as it was still breathtaking to watch despite the premature conclusion and dark lighting. however, the next episode cut corners and ultimately seemed too rushed. even then, i had hope the series could return to its former glory.ah, you poor, naïve child.little did i know the last two episode weres not only rushed, but sacrificed almost a decades worth of character development, just for cheap shock value. it felt like an insult not just to me, but to all the fans who were on board with this show since day one, and even to loyal fans of the books series.and then the finale.i'm not going to even talk about it.it doesn't deserve words.got is dead, and i'll never be able to see it again.for those of you who have never seen it before, i warn you. watch something else. watch something like breaking bad, or the sopranos, or mad men, or literally any other show in existence that has a better and more faithful conclusion than this one. don't be like me.that is all."
2019-05-30,cvbssbsffczcc,The best tv show ever,10,this the greatest show i ever seen no wan can be best then this not even breaking bad thx grrm for this tv show
2019-05-30,layllaslocker-23640,The worst writing in history of TV!,10,"the moment they didn't have books to rely on, it all went to hell. talent = 0.cast and crew u were great! you did not deserve that! i'm sorry."
2019-05-30,adiwro,"Big potential, but poor finish...",10,"feel devastated after final episide, everything for nothing...."
2019-05-30,joniwalensi,not worth watching,10,the last season made the whole series trash tier. do not watch
2019-06-03,ritvikdtta,Awesome beginning.... but the ending,10,"seasons 1,6 : 10 stars season 7: 8 stars. dialogues and the storyline started to go downhill
season 8: 3 stars"

2019-06-02,martolini-55532,Just Fen,10,"this series movie was amaising, the negative comments for the last episode, are from the biggest fans, who can't imagine this idea of end, i wish to all actors, to make more similar movies to distribute the fan's love. for the brain of the operation i don't know , only he know's."
2019-06-03,alistairbryden,Game Of Thrones,10,"great tv show up until the last two seasons,makes it pointless watching the show knowing the ending is rubbish."
2019-06-05,thimenob,Started off great,9,i liked season 1 and 2 a lot but in my opinion it was too cruel so i stopped watching because i'm not good with stuff like that. otherwise great storyline!
2019-06-06,crissylee-83196,Absolutely best show EVER,10,"the best show in the history of television! the twists, the characters, the crazy intense battle scenes, the insane ways that people you love die...it's just all amazing!"
2019-06-07,uae-40885,The worst season in the history of TV shows,10,powerfull season's from 1 to 7 then a huge disappointment in se8.
2020-04-23,rouagarabetian,Weird,10,"i can't understand those who votes with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 if a series like ""game of thrones"" which is amazing series and that's took it a lot of effort and time from the whole team they vote with 1, what other series would they like to put 10."
2019-06-09,bakybateman,Great till season 7,10,"gets off to a slow start, season 1 and 2 are sort of build ups. but the writing is top notch and the character arcs are amazing with a lot of potential to develop. from season 3 it starts to become gripping with stuff happening, nail gripping scenes hoping your favourite character stays alive.season 7 is decent, but trash with many plot holes and things that make no sense.season 8 is trash tier, literally garbage that ruins the whole series as a whole. hopefully the books get finished and tell a different story."
2020-07-21,karimelgohiny,Best series in history,10,"best series ever watched like for real, hope more great, similar ideas be present in upcoming series"
2019-06-11,fattyish,Best Show I have ever came upon! S8 is another story though,10,"i started watching this show in 2015. i was a late,bloomer and wasn't too sure about watching a show like this. fantasy shows weren't my thing, and it didn't seem to be my kind of show. my friends spent 2 whole years trying to convince me to watch it, and one day i lost a bet and they forced me to watch the entire 1st season....losing that bet was the best thing that ever happened to me...!i'm not even joking. i watched this entire series from 2015 and i'm ashamed i didn't watch it earlier, because this show is everything! it has a thrilling, blood-chilling plot that is exhilarating. i have grew to every single character that has ever been introduced, and after season 1 it was difficult to stay attached to my favorites because this was the first survival show where it taught me that no one is safe. no one. as one character even said, ""when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. there's no middle ground,"" and boy did they get it right. too many close calls for everyone, and too many potential deaths to cry about.here's a hint: don't get too attached to any character. whether it's a main character or a side character, don't get attached. otherwise you learn it the hard way and you cry about it for about a good week.brilliant plot and some of the most beautiful and outstanding plot's ever. i have spent over $200 on merchandise because i couldn't help myself. it was worth every penny. i have clothing, mugs, posters and accessories. been to 2 meet-and -greets that i have pictures with the cast member that i cherish for life!season 8 was kinda rocky. not gonna lie, it did kinda ruin everything this show worked towards. it wasn't the fact that it was awful, because i know that's what a lot of people are saying. it was a bit underwhelming compared to it's predecessors. i guess i was expecting more than what i bargained for, and it didn't turn out the way i wanted it to. but just because this show didn't live up to my complete expectations, it doesn't mean it was horrible. it just could've been better drawn out. i feel like if the writers and producers had listened to hbo's offer for another season, they could've explained everything better, because 6 episodes was clearly not enough to explain everything that happened in season 8. i knew it would be a bittersweet ending, but people gotta remember that this was all meant to be. it could've explained things a whole lot better. it was genuinely good, but far too rushed.other than that, my final position for the entire show as a whole seasons 1-7: 9.8/10
season 8: 6.9/10 lacking but not too god-awfulgame of thrones is a legacy that will be watched and talked about for years to come. thank you to the cast and crew who made the past 4 years of my life spectacular and fulfilling. i'll miss tuning in on sundays for a new episode, but as dr seuss once said, ""don't be sad that it's over, be glad it happened."""
2021-02-16,tuckest-59761,Greatest ever,10,best series there ever was and ever will be. don't listen to the haters about the ending. it's not supposed to make you happy but be shocked and astonished. mission accomplished
2019-06-14,donnsy,Would have been 10 but for the last two seasons,10,"loved this show until the last few seasons where it was dumbed down. the cinematography was beautiful, except in the ""the long night: where it was too dark to see what was happening. also this episode had some of the worse battle defence strategy i have ever seen, which again highlighted how bad the writing becomes in this show in the last seasons. if basing my rating on the last two seasons i would give it a 2, but earlier seasons were fantastic."
2019-06-15,larshagren,A long-runner unable to come to a satisfying end.,10,"although game of thrones, throughout it's 7 season long running time, has contained some of the more interesting character developments and gutsy plot,twists of any current tv series, the series failed in the end to deliver a satisfying end to all drama it had built up, cutting a big hole in the overall experience.more and more effort was put into special effects and costly props on sets around the world to please the ever-growing number of viewers, which worked up until the last two seasons. however, when the time came to bind the story together at the end, and at the same time preserving the well-established traits of the several main characters scheming in this brutal political landscape, the makters of the series lost their way.it is still watchable for the first 5 seasons, but after that, maybe read the book instead."
2019-06-15,chakrawibaha,D&D ruined it,10,it was the best show but from the season 5 and it's going down
2019-06-16,stefanomaglione-12761,The best HBO show ever.,10,"to me game of thrones is similar to watching historical docuseries with dragons, mystical creatures, and giving the viewer or reader the feeling middle ages show with how we all imagine those times with dragons, sorcerers, and goblins. most shows you know the actors are acting. game of thrones is the best hbo show on tv. thank you so much for the amazing performance. one of your favorite fans, stefano"
2020-05-26,rajpatilin,Game of thrones,9,it is so good in series mader see real because it series character is so many is names is so interesting and i am so many times forgot her name
2020-09-01,faisalyo,BEST SERIES,10,the best series ever i don't think that we will see better than this.
2019-06-22,bobtrelfa,"Strong Start, Questionable Finish",10,the show was good at the beginning when they were following the books. not to say the show wasn't good after just there was a noticeable dip in quality. the final season was too rushed because d&d wanted to go direct star wars.

2019-07-18,otherf,Still the best thing i ever watched (strictly my personal opinion ),10,"yes ofcourse season 8 is bad, very rushed, destory characters, logic most importantly our belief. but i still love the story, yes!! i love the concept. but i dont agree completely like danerys transformation, that badly. and jon snows character ruin(why he resurrected ) and the way they ended every character arc, as satisfying. thats not the way of game of thrones.but i still love the show, just because season 8 is bad not means the whole show is bad, everyone angry about how its end, but i dont forget the thrill it give to me, the emotions. i watched over 30 tv series, but for me no other series influence the way game of thrones does to me. i cannot even describe the emotions, yes i am addicted towards it, and i am happy for that.like i mentioned above, this is strictly my opinion"
2019-07-20,cacholitoo,Mindblowing,7,"best. show. ever with those words i ve transmiten what i wanted to say......
so yeah"
2020-04-06,daffaaudi,One of best series,10,"everything was good until the last season, the villain they've been built slowly from the beginning just went to the death that easily and doesn't make any sense at all. one more daenerys's dead could be easily predicted in early or mid season i guess. you gonna get a perfectly cooked golden steak in season 1,6 and a raw steak on the rest of the series."
2019-08-01,yanivzor,Worst ending season ever,10,worst ending season that makes lost look like a masterpiece. don't watch this show if you haven't already. i have literally created this account so i can rate this show down because d&d do not deserve any kind of credit for it and should never be hired for anything ever again.
2020-10-18,felix-27409,From better to worst,10,"adapting a book is fair game for showwriters. david and dan were experts at adapting the complex books to a tv format. and so the first 4 seasons are some of the best in tv history. however, when they no longer had george rr martins books to adapt they had to continue the story in their own way. and a story as good and complex as game of thrones need a clear direction that has history at its back. when d&d wrote the story it began to crumble under what grrm had laid out, it was quite the task. but in my opinion the last seasons utterly failed. so in summary the first seasons were some of the best in tv history, the last ones were some of the worst."

2019-08-14,cdhealthylife,Was great until season 8,10,"we couldn't wait for season 8 however when we finally got to see it, it was a disappointment the last episode was dull and seem to leave unanswered info there was a seen in episode 5 where the bald eunuch,( i forgot his name) has a little girl say to him am afraid people might figure things out and said for to hide from the queen this was just before the eunuch was going to be put to death who was she and why was she not shown again"
2011-05-10,pointybongo,Here's why the HBO series is so true to the book:,6,"first, the book's author, george r.r. martin, was very much involved (as series writer & co, executive producer) in the hbo series' creation (which is likely why it's taken so long for him to release the next book in a song of ice and fire). and second, the serial format is ideal for maintaining fidelity to the spirit of martin's wonderful story. a major challenge faced by the creators of the lord of the rings (lotr) films was the amount of material they had to cull from toliken's epic tale in order to fit into three relatively short films. the serial format provided by hbo eliminates this problem. in fact, nothing would please me more than to see a proper adaptation of lotr filmed in this way. another pleasing aspect of this series is the obvious devotion to quality. by hiring a world class production designer (gemma jackson) and a slate of top-notch english actors, the creators of game of thrones have been able to re-create martin's world in a beautiful and convincing way."

2019-09-03,lightsaber-17818,A True Masterpiece!!!,10,"i absolutely love game of thrones! the writing for this show is truly phenomenal. game of thrones is an outstanding example of television at its finest! i loved the entirety of the shows 8 year run. the characters, plot, and set up are truly amazing in this show. game of thrones is one of those rare examples of a show that i've loved for the entirety of it. yes, that includes season 8. i definetly recommend game of thrones to anyone who enjoys medieval fantasy, or just really good television!"
2020-07-21,dylan-james2003,Almost Perfect,10,i really wanted to rate got a 10 but the last season was such a disappointment i couldn't. the problem with the last season is the writing there are lots of plots that either get ignored or a unsatisfying conclusion. also some of the character arch's just seem stupid in the last season. however the first 7 seasons are contain some of the best writing and visuals that tv has to offer. no character on this show is safe and main characters get killed off all the time. i would defiantly recommend watching the first 7 seasons of this show and then maybe make up your own ending because it will almost definitely be better than the actual ending.
2021-08-20,atianafee,Very sad,9,"it's been 2 years now and i am still sad for the end of this show and how it ends.. it is the greatest show ever until season 7 ...

2019-10-03,analuciatmartinez,One-track mind.,10,"game of thrones (an hbo tv series written by george r. r. martin), has clearly been the biggest remarkable achievment on tv of all times, not only because of the plot itself, but also because of how it has been produced, the characters, scenography and the astounding use of technology. in spite of being a fantasy story placed in another time and maybe world, game of thrones breaks all the schemes.as the title of the serie says, got tells the story of a medieval country's civil war. this fictional world presents two continents: westeros and essos in which each of their seven kingdoms leaders, lords or heirs fight in order to claim for the iron throne and rule over the seven kingdoms.before watching the serie, it was like every serie or movie that i've watched didn't leave me with anything. once some credit part ends, my thoughts stayed there, nothing else to think about but got takes everything to the next level. it has the outlandish ability to keep you thinking about it till the next chapter, the next season and so on. each of the seasons have their own particular touch, from the mythical creatures that lurk there, the technology that can make extraordinary scenographies and magic with a computer to the intertwined stories between the characters.if you are the kind of person who likes unthinkable mythical. war and love stories and you are looking for something that wouldn't be out of your mind, then this is your best choice. in spite of being ended now, be ready to sit for hours to watch it. and as someone told me before watching it... don't get attached to anyone, don't choose a side and be ready for the unexpected."

2019-10-11,fh-36884,A amazing show ruined by a horrible final season,10,"this show was honestly up there as one of, if not the greatest tv show of all time for the first 6 maybe 7 seasons. then season 8 happened and it became apparent how much dnd butchered the show. my recommendation: watch the first seven seasons then stop there. while seven is definitely not the strongest season, it contains some must watch episodes. just make sure never to watch the 8th season.
8/10"
2020-05-11,olivertait,Reverse walking dead,8,"the main issue with game of thrones is the writers clearly wanted to move on to other projects, namely star wars. were the walking dead has been dragged on for too long, game of thrones fatal mistake was being rushed. season's 1,6 are fantastic up there with the best television ever. 7 was okay, rushed but okay. season 8...season 8. what happened. the ending was so dissapointing. spoiler: jon becoming king although predictable would've been satisfying. but no they thought we don't know how to end it look online copy and paste a plot and done, but bran the weirdo has to come out on top despite being extremely dislikeable."
2020-04-10,tanushreedasbhowmick,Best TV series ever. 💯,10,"between cinematic effect rivaled by even few movies and other elements, i have yet to see a tv series match it or even come close. before game of thrones with the exception of breaking bad and maybe a few other series, very few had kept me glued from beginning to end. it also did what few have done and not only kept you guessing from episode to episode (whether it be who falls in love, who changes from good to evil, who dies, who comes back, new relationships made, old friendships ending and so on)but also built from the first season to the last progressively. it had an extremely grounded, reastic, morbid, grim, brutal, sad, and other negative effects type of storytelling with few bouts of positive triumph, but that's what made it amazing. because the dark moments sure become so much lighter when everything seems to be lost. although many won't approve because of the liberal use of nudity, sexualism, profanity and graphic violence, i defend it wholeheartedly. what in the news and nowadays otherwise is all that much different, at least this one has good writing and equal elements of good. the art direction is impeccable, the writing and acting are perfect across the board, and the visual effects and practical effects are outstanding, especially given this is a tv series and they are better than what most fantasy movies put out. i can't applaud the actors enough, the supporting actors made most lead actors in other series look like amateurs, the leads made most of those in their class look like supporting actors and the good definitely made it easy to cheer for them while the evil were more than capable of carrying out a good effort for people to hate them. if you are into fantasy, medieval, or just good acting entertainment in general and can at least sit through the elements that you consider obscene or over the top, you will love this show , frankly i find it almost impossible to hate it."
2020-04-11,adas-14881,Greatest Television show ever. The real GOT 💓,10,"game of thrones is the best show to ever reach television, and coming from me, that's saying something,trust me. when i first started watching this show i knew i would have to pay close attention as the plot progressed, because i heard it was insanely confusing to keep track of everything; and so, i watched all 8 season 3x over, and now call myself a got expert (that, and because i've read all the books). the plot is exquisite, and the scenery is breathtaking. if you like awe-inspiring shows, in this one, there are an endless amount of ""goosebump-giving"" scenes where chills run down your back, so that department should be covered. what also makes watching this show so good, is the fact that everyone else has watched it, and now you can talk with them about it! if you wanna be an expert on this show, there at least 100 main characters, so i suggest watching it multiple times over-maybe even reading the books as well.the setting takes place in two fictional land masses; essos, and westeros. most of the show takes place in westeros, where there are a lot (and i mean a lot) of noble houses competing for power (and attempting to get control of the iron throne) with their own armies. some of the noble houses are: the starks, lannisters, baratheon, martells, tyrells, freys, and greyjoys. in essos, we get to see daenerys targaryen (the dragon queen) embark on her journey as she builds up the most massive army the word has ever seen (consisting of dothraki, unsullied, tyrion lannister, and dragons!), to take control in westeros and the iron throne. in westeros however, all the way north, there is an evil force that is now arising after being dormant for thousands of years (the dead/white walkers), and strives to destroy all of mankind.these are a long 8 seasons, but they are worth it, trust me!!"
2019-10-28,jayseanger1234,Best Show in the 21st Century,10,"brilliant, purposeful, and epic! if you like lord of the rings, then you will be in for a ride. character development is heavily emphasized and it is beautifully written across the many seasons in parallel with story arcs. however, season 8 is just ok."
2019-10-21,tristandahl,A mockery of ASOIAF,10,"asoiaf is a genius book,series by grrm, and in my opinion, perhaps the best piece of literature of our century.hbo taking this on was an ambitious attempt, and i have full understanding for some of the compromises made and the fact that they caught up with the books.ultimately i think they should've made the series some 10-20 years later, so they would've been able to ground the show a lot more to the books, and we would have avoided the chaos of post-season 4/5."

2019-12-12,diebeetus,Terrible show,10,i wish there was a rating lower than one this show was terrible from start to finish. all it was is a fairy tale for people that live in the south so they could have intercourse with brother and sister. the plot was terrible the man that wrote this is terrible i have never seen an episode where i was like all man i can't wait for the next one. the only good episode was the one that south park did. congratulations lord of the rings meets people in alabama
2019-12-14,dcady-70394,All I have to say is WOW!!!!!,10,i absolutely fell in love with this show. was soo excited every new season! all the build up all the episodes for them to kabosh the last season in the worst possible way!! i could carry on about the long tiring list of there lame attempts to wrap up a show in a half a season when there should have been a minimum of 2 full seasons left! in all reality they probably could have got creative and stretched the cho cha out to add another possible 10 seasons! it's not like they weren't making $$$$. it felt like someone stole my dog then pointed and laughed at me while my own dog pissed on my leg!
2019-12-21,devawidiprima,Nah,4,"yes, you can completely ruin a show with a terrible ending, and that is what got will be forever remembered for: the worst final season of all time. an ending so bad, it ruins the rewatchability of the show. let me start off by saying, i was as big of a fan of the show and the books as you could possibly be. i finished the books in 2012, and since have reread most of them. i have watched season 1,6 more times than i even feel comfortable admitting. i wanted to pour my disappointment into a beautifully written polemic, but instead, i am going to put as much effort into the rest of this review as benioff and weiss did into the final season:stupid story, arcs ruined, plots abandoned, rush rush rush, every character takes stupid pills, okay let's wrap this up already, fight fight, cgi, okay we're done. screw you nerds, let's go get that sweet star wars and netflix money.btw, i find it odd people are still doing ""spoiler alerts"" three months after a series has ended. here is a spoiler alert for you, season 8 spoils the entire series."

2020-09-25,wineforliving,Great Show,10,"really this is one of the best television shows ever produced. clearly, it is hard to emulate dense novels in screen format, even in long,form, so it does not do that perfectly; however, if you watch it for what it is... a tv show... you will judge it fairly.there is a lot of consternation about the last season. there shouldn't be. all stories come to an end. often suddenly. the end of this series was not only sound, but also satisfying, from a pure story standpoint. i honestly don't understand the backlash. in fact i enjoy re-watching the final season. if you haven't watched the series, do not let the bad reviews of the final season sway your decision to watch this show."
2020-05-24,drdeepthakor,Nothing like this ever before,10,"this is one of the best tv series i've ever watched on hbo. the best thing about game of thrones is its cast there are hundreds of people involved in cast and they take care of every single detail and it is so bold , amazing and everything is short out , so not even a single second is wasted during watching the episode and this is one of the best stories ever. so i would suggest to must watch game of thrones before you die."

2020-02-10,purefalls,"Great Start, Bad Finish",10,"game of thrones is based off the fantasy novel series, ""a song of ice and fire"" by the outstanding author george r. r. martin. while the shows first four seasons remain mostly true to the books season five starts to take a different course.david benioff and d. b. weiss who are the show runners, are the main writers and executive produce the show. for this work properly they needed to listen to martin and follow what he had to say. after season 5 they had run out of written material, as the books had not yet been finished. they did have talks with george r. r. martin to see what his point of view on it is and how he wants to end it etc. but it seems they did him an injustice by speeding everything up so they can move on to other projects.a story that use to be unpredictable became very predictable, even if you had read the novels and knew the twist and turns that lied within, it still gives you a shock to see it on the television. but in season five it starts to fade with poor choices. season six remains the same. then seven it all starts to fade. the story no longer starts to make much sense. if you watch it, you will see what i mean. dragons like a jet. finally eight, is just a shocker really. i didn't even know what the show had become anymore.i used to love this show so much at one point. it has a dense universe. george r. r. martin is amazing at world building. the first four seasons did well to capture a side of westeros and essos but it just starts to lack after. fortunately there are more shows coming within the world of game of thrones so we can only hope these pick up the same golden status it use to have and help us explore this deep dark beautiful world."
2020-02-18,celsoformalejo,Should have been a 10!,8,"this show was great! a must watch. i (like most of the world) was disappointed and downright mad at the rushed last season. why would the writers do that? we may never know.i'd probably be rewatching the whole series if it ended they it should have. but all of that aside, it really was my favorite show ever.the story, the actors, sets, costumes, etc were all far better than any other tv series.it should have been a 10 but the last 3 episodes knocked it to a 9.9 is still worth a watch. and if you know that the last season is disappointing you might not be as heartbroken as the world was after waiting a year and a half!"

""fantasy"" is necessary because there's no need to attend to actual human feeling or behavior, it's ""make believe"". it sure as hell is. i'm not against fantasy, if it has some real psychological truth under it, like jack and the beanstalk. this is one lie after another. i hate it i hate it i hate it. i think the snow white blond gets her revenge on everybody later in the series but i don't care. it's so bad. i don't mind nudity, or even weak men - i loved the unbearable lightness of being. i just hate it when something awful is so popular and praised everywhere. sigh."

2020-04-13,anew-92082,The Ending Worked for Me,8,"got was an epic that had its own rules defined by the author. it took many of us on an incredible journey over years.the ending worked for me precisely because it was generally unsatisfying in a number of ways but very much in line with its own universe in which happy fairy,tale endings arise in the fantasies of children but dissolve under the weight of harsh realities.a happy ending in this complex and brutal world of political intrigue, betrayal, expediency and survival of the most unscrupulous would have been the most disappointing ending.""happy ever after"" never had a reasonable chance in this universe."
2019-05-21,adelara777,The Greatest Show Of All Time,7,"simply put this show is the greatest of all time, don't listen to naysayers crying over an ending they didn't like. these hypercritical people have nothing to do but criticize anything. the acting is superb from the beginning to the end. the story is engrossing and the conclusion is perfect for the what game of thrones is."
2020-06-18,nahednarsha,Masterpiece..,7,"don't listen to those of low rating, the show is absolutely masterpiece, brilliant fantasy story, amazing actors and fantastic music. forget the end of disappointing season 8 and enjoy it. game of thrones deserves that."

2020-04-25,achrefchouaya,All Seasons are not bad,1,no one can deny that game of thrones is one of the greatest tv series of all time. season 1 was great but with some boring things. season 2 and 3 were greater. season 4 is the greatest season in the history of tv series of all time. season 5 was good but not better than season 4. season 6 was legendary and no one can forget what happened in the battle of bastards between jon snow and ramsay bolton but what was hidden is that battle was really between house stark and house bolton the starks won with the help of little finger and the vale. season 7 was good too but not better than the previous seasons. but season 8 was not great so i give season 8 8/10.

amazing plot, brilliant characters.
right from the very first episode you get hooked. then season 7, good but a little rushed and not of got's standards, then comes a little disappointment, the ruined ending. everything is so great about this show, you'll love it and keep loving it, will always keep you at the edge of your seat. a perfect show & the highest rated one before the rushed ending. this is one of those shows everyone should watch. give it a shot. it's better than any other show you've previously watched."
2021-08-21,elegantbruh,Season 8 is SHHHITTTTEEEEEE,10,"those dumbass writers ruined the show. they should never be allowed to write again for making such an abomination, even the cast thought it was garbage. they are truly the most idiotic people in the film industry by a massive margin."

2020-05-04,nicolaseliass,"High budget, High quality, Amazing music, Exciting fantasy series",10,"i didn't start watching got until after the series was complete. i watched all 8 seasons in roughly 3 weeks. this show is absolutely incredible. overall, got has a great script, a superb cast, outstanding real locales, and so many twists and turns you will never guess what will happen next.
best thing that's ever been on the big or small screen. hands down.... its literally had me climbing over my sofa with tension.final season included. i would love to see something come even close to how good this was...
people have been too obsessed with how season 8 ended i think it was fine. season 8 is the reason the rating of the show went down but i don't think its as bad as making it to be."
2020-05-05,soyernaylan,Watch this Show,10,"brilliant, epic, breathtaking, never seeing what it's happening next. the setting is unprecedented, the best fantasy series in the history of television, a whole new theme makes the perfect enterance.
acting was as usual best we have seen in any series.
with that said. go watch the show!!! if you haven't yet. you don't know what you are missing out on."
2011-06-19,russell_girao_173,The best i've seen!,10,"this series has a story that unravels piece by piece, and gives time for the characters to develop and show their acting! the actors excel in every scene and the story keeps you glued to the tv. it is really the best series i have ever seen, it has action and the storyline is great. it's difficult to describe how good it is, the scenarios are deep and bring us to forget day to day life. it is way better than a lord of the rings version series, it's story is richer and more compelling, has less action, but it's story compensates. i compare it with battlestar galactica or stargate atlantis, that were well written and produced, but i think this one could be better. pros: actors, storyline , well produced, action! i think the producers prove themselves as genius not in movies but only in series, as it is a lot more difficult to keep a great audience for a long time, and this one could be one of those!!"
2020-05-06,sandisolian,"A truly unique, Assiduously crafted, An undisputed masterpiece",10,"this is the best thing i've ever seen on television, probably there wasn't a show before with this big.... ""game of thrones"" has stunning super special effects, great storylines, complex characters, many things to wonder about, magic, mystery, fantasy.. it's otherworldly . . i've been reading the books that the series is based on and i understand it isn't possible to include everything but that doesn't matter. this isn't just tv but its art and a masterpiece."
2020-05-07,wmmwpft,"One of the best shows of all time,",10,"it's a masterpiece! there's so much work and so many details in this story, and not forget to mention ramin dejwadi great music it made extraordinary thing i really love it, the 8 season was not what i expected to be i think that a lot of work was just moved faster than usual but after all the background music was epic and really emotional it made me fell in love in music world.... so if you haven't seen it, i highly recommend it."

2020-05-17,peterjamanian,For who gives 1,10,"honestly the person who giving 1 is an uncultured person, forgive me but this is my opinion, rating shouldn't be to express anger, it is only an evaluation to give it what is deserves.
despite disappointing season 8 ""game of thrones"" has stunning super special effects, great storylines, complex characters, many things to wonder about, magic, mystery, fantasy.. it's otherworldly . . a truly unique, assiduously crafted, an undisputed masterpiece.
there's so much work and so many details in this story, and great music it made extraordinary thing i really love it,

2019-05-24,tammiet,"The best show of my lifetime, to date",10,"yes, there are problems. all in all, this is the most imaginative, visually stunning story i've ever been told. every episode is like a movie. they did kind of eff off the final season, however, with as ""bad"" as some say it is, it's still better than 98% of the tv available anywhere. if you enjoy a good plot, lots of violence and nudity and just plain good story,telling, try got. you can thank me later."

2019-05-22,nadimbo,One of a kind success that ended in Hindenburg-like disaster,10,"as other users have mentioned, the first few seasons (1,6) of the show were a phenomenon. a story that had us gossip, speculate, theorize, and enjoy for years.but somewhere after season 6, the show ran out of book material and into uncharted waters. blinded by their past success, i assume the show runners felt they were up to the task of taking it to a proper end.in season 7 you could notice signs of the downfall, like they were trying to foreshadow it.and then season 8 happened. after a 2 year break the anticipation was as high as it can be. after each failed episode, illogical character arc, rich story line butchered or forgotten, i'd tell myself that maybe the next episode will redeem the show. but it never came.i will remember this show not for what it was, but for what it could have been. i'm giving it 7 stars. one for each episode that i liked. my only consolation now is that grrm will finish the books, so that i can how the story should have ended."
2020-05-21,basemsalina,AMAZING,1,"the best series ever great build of the characters very cool events , great music , thanks hbo...."
2021-03-21,mohiman-81859,One of the best series,9,"it was very good until season 5 in my idea. but after that season, it was decreased a bit, because after season 5 they (directors and......) just wanted to end it. but again it was good up to season 7, unfortunately in season 8 it was awful very awful, but again i say it is one of the best series in the world and i suggest it to who really like fantasy series or movies"
2020-05-22,gizmakman,The best TV Show Ever,1,"it's simple, it is the best tv series ever. that's it. just watch it..."
2020-06-07,screaminginhorror,Ruined,9,"in these difficult, lonely times, curious first,timers might want to take the plunge on a binge watch of this vast story. as a former fan who loved thrones for many years, i think i can be a reliable guide to help you away from this dangerous temptation.although i'm not a fan of fantasy as a genre, i was drawn to the complex plot and the constellation of frequently gripping characters. at its best, every scene had purpose; and, taken as a whole, the show had the fascination of a snake pit. unfortunately, right from the first scene of the first episode onwards, the whole narrative is directed torwards its end point. while this gives drive to the plot and makes for compelling viewing at the time, it means ultimately the whole thing sinks or swims depending on what the ending becomesthe ending of this particular tv drama is without a doubt the worst i have ever personally watched. it betrays itself in just about every way, to force an ending that is about the worst possible type to be. everything that made it great for fantasy and non-fantasy fans alike, is ditched for a lazy, arrogant parody of itself. during the last episode, despite knowing what was coming, i had my head in my hands and was wincing at nearly every line of dialogue. the whole thing feels like it was written over a drunken/ coked-up weekend, and they later hadn't bothered to reread anything they'd put down. frequently, the dialogue and events don't make sense from minute-to-minute, sometimes even second-to-second.if someone had told me at the beginning of last year that after watching season 8 i would never want to watch any episodes of thrones ever again (and wish i had never even started), i wouldn't have believed them. even if it was disappointing, surely there must be something to salvage, with so many characters, so many storylines? think again. characters i used to love had become incoherent, empty husks of themselves; usually grossly underwritten, and frequently dislikable. the substantive plot had degraded so much, to something only goldfish with 10-second memories could enjoy. even now i still can't quite believe what happened. the twists i was expecting, the meaning behind events, and characters' behaviour: all just evaporates into a smug nihilistic void. thrones for me is now just a bad memory.the ending is now one of the lowest rated endings of any long-running tv show on imdb. on the first anniversary of this tv massacre, the millions of us who were narratively victimised should hold fast to our responsibility to continue to dissuade innocents from joining our ranks.save yourself many hours of your life: do not watch game of thrones."
2020-05-29,carlanaderian,Don't waste your time reading the negative reviews!!,10,"do not believe any of those negative reviews. i honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. i think some people love the gossip stories.this show is stunning, incredible and definitely worth your time! however, be warned! once you start you won't be able to stop and tv will never be the same! there is enough dead series television. but once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. game of thrones is one such show."
2020-05-26,paravsaran-65822,Extraordinary show turned mediocre,10,"so this show was perfect until season 6 everything was so good , s7 was still good but not as good as the previous seasons the storyline became kind of obvious and anti climatic . and the finale was disastrous the writing was so bad ruined the whole series for me , it felt like i watched the whole series for nothing ."
2020-05-27,haithembadidou-25025,Nothing much to add,1,"like everyone did i was stunned by how this show was so good in terms of the turn of events and unexpectable moments and deaths so many layered characters , acting was on point
but ... also like everyone did i was socked by s8 it was not the best ending season for this amazing show but not so terrible at least we got an ending i guess lol
anyways i highly recommend this show to everyone"
2020-05-27,adityabindalth,Unbelievable,8,"lot of twist and great suspense perfect direction
you should watch this its the best no web series can beat this in case of twist and shocking moments a must watch web series . however the pace is slow but you will not be disabled if you continued to watch this series"

2020-06-04,elafsarmoud,Don't believe the bad ratings!,10,"don't believe any of those bad ratings this is just about anger reaction to the season 8 and forget what ""game of thrones"" really deserves."
2020-06-21,ivanirva,The end is exactly what makes it perfect !,9,"many people were navigating among romanticism. did you ever notice that throughout the series, things didn't turn out as you were expecting ? well, the final season (especially the final episode) perfectly fits with that idea.if you are still the type of viewer who hopes for a typical cinderella romantic ending, then you may feel ""betrayed""."
2020-06-17,vijayaanjana,Great.,10,"got have proved to be one of the best tv series of all time.the series ended with an disappointed conclusion and rueing character arcs.but we can't denie the fact that it's an technical and cinematic experience.
give it a try and after a few episodes you will be lost in the world of westeros.
george rr martin is a true genius and a gem to the world of entertainment."

2020-11-02,gogul-50312,Awe+,9,"really tremendous series except for the last season
if there is 2 more seasons extended the story would be nicer and ending too"
2021-07-24,clementinnywiz,best show,10,ngl. anyone needs to see it. last 2 seasons are dissapointing but the rest is worth it.
2020-06-27,tushardu,Superb !!!,10,many are complaining about season 8! but i think its season 8 is absolutely ok.
2020-06-26,lovesharma-30016,Loved the series but got huge disappointment at the end,10,you should probably make 1 more season to make things right.... you can write the story in the way you want just make it right in s9 you can show us like bran is seeing the future or something like that but give it a happy ending at least.... if the ending is not good then the show doesn't matter..
2020-06-28,xxcoralpearsonxx,Great TV series.,9,when watching all of the seasons of this show i was equally captivated and drawn in because of the detail that was precented.
2011-06-20,phoenix-edge,"Excellent adaptation of an amazing book, with some notable flaws",10,"ever since the first book was released in 1996, i have been an ardent fan of the song of ice and fire books by george r. r. martin; the series is one of the best fantasy novel series ever written in my opinion. as such, i have eagerly anticipated the tv adaptation of the books. now that season one has finished, i feel i am able to give a complete and fair review of this show.season one of game of thrones does an excellent job of staying true to the first book of martin's series named, not surprisingly, game of thrones. the plot of this book revolves around three major story lines: the political tensions on the continent of westeros that eventually lead to a conflict known as the war of the five kings, the exiled princess daenerys targaryen who plots to reclaim the rule of westeros that her family has ruled for nearly the last 300 years until robert's rebellion (yes, the same king robert baratheon in the show), and the awakening of an ancient evil known as the others in the north beyond the wall. the show aptly captures the essence of each of these three story lines, tying them together cleverly so that the audience sees how each of these three threads are being woven into one overarching plot. given that even 10 hours worth of material is not nearly enough to tell the full story in the book version of game of thrones, the writers of the show should be applauded for brilliantly transferring to the small screen all of the foreshadowing, character motivations and personalities, cultures, drama, politics, and emotion of the book.the acting is top notch. nearly every actor brilliantly portrays their characters just as they are portrayed in the books. it is worth watching these episodes over and over again just to see their performances. even the children actors do a fantastic job. the sets and costume designs are also very well done , i wonder if there was any collaboration with those who worked on the tudors, a somewhat similar series on hbo that reminds me of this show in terms of set and costume designs. now on to the parts of the show that i felt like were disappointing. even though hbo apparently sunk nearly five million dollars into each episode, the show still felt low budget. perhaps the most disappointing part of the show was the fact that most of the action scenes from the book were either emitted or harshly truncated in the show. the choreography of the few action scenes that were in the show were mediocre, i felt. given that the story largely revolves around a war, it is a bit silly to not even attempt to show any of the battles in this war. budget constraints are no excuse - the history channel does a fine job of portraying epic historical battles using almost no budget at all.some other rather disappointing facets of the show that reeked of low budget was the fact that nearly every scene was a scaled down version of the scene from the book (save for the end of episode 9 - now that was brilliantly executed). for example, khal drogo's khalasar is a horde that consists of about forty thousand warriors alone, and yet no more than about 10-15 are shown at any one time. the result is that the viewer never really realizes how powerful khal drogo is and why daenarys is such an important character. hbo could have used a little bit of creative cgi to easily show the true scope of many scenes from the book. the direwolves were also conspicuously absent throughout the show. in the book, they played a much larger role. i will say that i was pleasantly surprised with the cgi in the final scene of the final episode, however. now why couldn't such cgi have been used for the direwolves? budget constraints, i know, but come on, hbo had five million dollars to work with per episode - that's not exactly a shoestring budget (though admittedly, not such a large budget either - consider many one and half hour movies have cost over 100 million dollars to make).another complaint i have with the show was some of the unnecessary sex sequences. given the gritty realness of the books, it was certainly necessary to show sex and violence in the show to adequately capture the mood of the books. however, hbo went way overboard here. given that it's important to squeeze as much plot as possible into every episode, unnecessary and extraneous sexual sequences serve absolutely no purpose other than to mollify desperate and horny teenage boys, and in fact cheapen the importance of the main story lines. i had the same complaint with hbo's the tudors as well. so overall, this show did an excellent job, with some glaring exceptions. to sum up...pros: excellent acting, excellent portrayal of the plot, mood, and characters from the book, excellent sets and costume designcons: flagrant lack of action sequences, including failing to show battles in a story that revolves around a war, scaled down scope of many scenes, the direwolves didn't get the screen time they deserved, and unnecessary sex scenes."
2021-05-05,cramsey-18443,"Every season fantastic, except for season 8 which is still not terrible",10,"i personally think that a fantasy show that focuses on the characters more than the mythical things is great. it also is amazing how they really make you feel hate for the villains: joffrey, or ramsey: and also make you feel such love and care for the hero/ heroines: john, or daenerys. all the character arcs are amazing as well, but i personally think that jaime had the best character arc. from being such a hated character in the beginning, to becoming so humbled from his experiences, ( the chopping off of his hand, and the abuse he endured) that you just love him so much when it is all said and done."
2020-06-30,dhanrajjain-01915,Definitely need season 8 remake,10,it would be the best if it was'nt for the ending. character development is great. every character has their own story. acting is good no doubt. this series is flawless until the last season. ending is very dissapointing. every one spent so much time and was expecting an amazing end to it. i really want a remake of the last season with a good ending.
2020-09-14,zozosojic,Just finished the first season,10,have no idea how i retained myself of not watching this when everybody else did. i have to admit a forced myself to finish episode 1. didn't really get what all the fuss is about. but just finished the first season and jumped onto next one... it's so gooooood and very addictive!
2020-08-17,everprinzler,Got no words to describe how wonderful the series is..,10,"watched all the 8 seasons within 8 freaking days and guess what, to see daenerys targaryen die at last.....it was not cool though but still i give a rating of 10/10 becoz u kept her alive till the very last episode and also for the idea for making such a variety script"
2020-07-08,alexdandamudi-30606,The best series ! Untill the last season !The end could be better!,10,"till the 7th season it's the best show in all terms but the last season failed to reach people's expectations ! but anyway we can't degrade the whole show for this .. so, it's a good show !"
2020-11-03,simonasmilenschi,Great,10,"great great movie great movie moviegreat movie great movie
great movie"
2020-10-08,toby_dalton,Best Show of All Time (not exaggerating),10,"when you seriously consider the best shows of all time this is up in the conversation even with the most controversial final season of tv show history. most will say that ruined the show or it's not how you start, it's how you finish. crap. breaking bad is not better than this show, if game of thrones somehow ended at season 5 the content would brake it a 10 star show for everyone and 3xbetter than any nearby show, but it's not a 5 season show it's an at least 10 season show and that's where it went wrong but that not enough to knock it. you cannot compare a show like breaking bad to game of thrones and even though breaking bad is great it was saved by a good ending everything else was dominated by game of thrones, any other show can be compared but look at any part of game of thrones and compare it with that show for the first 7 seasons and notice the gap in quality then take the last season and compare them, does the quality make up for it, i doubt it. please don't be deterred from watching this show it is a masterpiece and deserves more respect and i hope the prequel series can bring the name up to a cornerstone of pop culture once again where it deserves to be. i never fail to love a moment in another show or film where there's a game of thrones reference i'm addicted like that, i tear up watching trailers for the series, i love this show, and i know anyone who has watched it loves this show."
2020-07-19,baroness-norman,Glad it's all over.,10,"over,hyped, overrated, overly-long pile o'junk. couldn't wait til it ended and my other-half finished hogging the telly.
it was just so forced. looking and feeling... so brown."
2020-11-17,rajkumar-80907,Political web series the best one,8,"to my lord and ladies!! this is one of the best tv web series is i ever watched, no doubt it is too long but worth of it"
2020-07-24,rileyk-01485,rubbish till season 8,10,"hated it. but liked season 8. it was pointless for the most part and boring. vile and digusting with little point. it is odd that i found the last season tolerable. though best quote. ""i drink wine and i know things""."
2021-01-06,atithyasuresh,The most sadistic icending an goat show could ever have😣,10,"this show was the best of its time until season 8. after breaking bad completed on 2013 this show easily became the greatest tv series within 2 years from there. but why?why did d&d chose to end it like this?is this the only possible way to end the series? is burning down the entire city the best way to end the series?that much of teasing for the white walkers had been done the past 7 to 8 years,but all of a sudden they are dead?that too in the middle of the final season? daenerys was thought to be the best charecter and believe me,each and everytime she inflates the size of her army from nothing, it was amazing to see her arc devolvement but all of a sudden, just in a single episode changing her into negative shades was not the best thing to do. she deserved a much better ending. i know d&d are far more better than wrtting such a sadistic ending.i'll consider the explanation of the word hodor as the most emotional scene. anyway i wish i could go back to good old times waiting for the white walkers to arrive into winterfell ."
2020-08-31,vishaldhuri-20797,Brilliant,10,it's. was the best series ever but session 8 was the worst episode in allover web series ..so plz equity is important roll in all there type of web series ..

2021-05-21,tutupaddhan,Thanks HBO for wasting my time.,9,"first 1 to 6 seasons are really great.. but after season that season 7 and 8 is the worst... specially season 8.i've never seen such a bad ending at all..
the worst ending ever....beginners don't watch this season after completing season 6.. otherwise it will disappoint you as it disappointed me...go to hell hbo for wasting my time...."
2020-07-27,rikasdiez,Almost the Best show of all,10,"this show had everything to be the best in history, great forgiveness, a universe with a lot of history, a great plot. the first 6 seasons were incredible,sonething never seen before. unfortunately the last seasons ruined the great big plot that came behind, leaving us with a very bad ending. hopefully there will be a remake cause this left us with a bad taste in our mouths."
2021-09-02,adipatel-99201,Badass,10,must watch. the wave they have made for the story the ups and downs comes in the series is af.

2021-06-09,sagarsthombre,Incredible..!!!,10,"greatest web series in the world.. watched 3 times, all episodes. casting is too good. each character is legend."
2020-08-02,mitul-13287,Best web series of all time,1,best web series of all time best web series of all time best web series of all time
2020-08-04,nikbelousov,The first and last seasons were very cool,10,"for me, seasons 3,4 were boring. in other seasons, i just blissed out. i advise everyone to watch the series."
2020-08-07,latoonofficial,The Best Series I Ever Watched But.....,9,"i watched it and totally fall in love with the series and all character but the last two seasons was the boring one,in the last two season the way of writing changed and the series get worse. after killing daenerys targaryen....and i was like what.
so recreate the last season."
2021-06-11,hilldj-27716,GOT thoughts,10,honestly up until the 3rd episode of season 8 the show is near flawless but unfortunately those final 3 episodes exist.
2020-09-06,leowinterling-207706161271,"Best series i've ever seen, i've even forgiven the end",10,"wow! by far the best series i have ever seen in my life. i am basically a fan of movies and series based on books, although they often differ greatly from the actual content. this is not the case with this series at all.
until season 7, the series follows geroge r. r. martin almost in perfection, but you don't get the impression that the actors read something from a piece of paper. every actor shows performances and lets you feel emotions, i have never seen in a movie or series before.
because of the higher number of main characters it is incredibly exciting until the very last episode. there is not just one character that you are excited about and that you love, there are thirteen (main characters).
there is no clear separation between black and white, between good and evil, there is no hero without flaw. you think and feel with each of these characters, and george r. r. martin always manages to change your mind about a character on which you have already formed an opinion. a good example is theon greyjoy:
i went from not caring about theon,
to hating theon,
to being disgusted by theon,
to feeling sad for theon,
to rooting for theon,
to being proud of theon,
to wanting to follow theon into battle.
that is how to write a character. utter brillance, george r. r. martin!
nevertheless, for me the most important thing in a film and especially in a series is the story. again, i must say that i have never seen such a precise, well,written, exciting, gripping, detailed, thoughtful, dynamic and emotional story. for those who don't know, the story is set in a fictional world and takes place on the continents of westeros and essos. the seven kingdoms of westeros resemble the european middle ages and are shielded by a huge wall of ice from an area of eternal winter in the north. spring, summer, autumn and winter can last for several years or even decades, their length is variable and unpredictable. the story begins at the end of a long summer and is initially told in three storylines, largely parallel to each other. tensions build up between the powerful noble houses of the empire, which eventually lead to an open fight for the throne. winter is coming, and a danger from a foreign power is looming in the far north of westeros, where the night watch at the wall is supposed to protect the kingdoms. in essos, daenerys targaryen, heiress of the royal family of westeros, which was deposed years ago, is striving to regain power.
the insanely complex story deals primarily with politics and power struggles, social relations, wars and religions.
the book is written in a demanding but not incomprehensible way, what is a very great art.
since david benioff and d. b. weiss follow the book for the most part, the series has the great effect that you put on headphones, the light dims, and you are no longer at home, you are at winterfell or king's landing.
no other series has made me feel this as much as game of thrones. compared to other fantasy stories, like the lord of rings, the witcher, or the chronicles of narnia, game of thrones is packed with breathtaking special effects, incredibly emotional and multi-faceted dialogues, gorgeous costumes, and funny sayings.
a wonderful addition from hbo is the music in the series. it is better than anything before. even movies like interstellar, star wars, pirates of the caribbean or gladiator can still learn something from game of thrones' music.
the only deficit in the series is season 8, which destroyed my desire to rewatch game of thrones."
2020-08-27,debraj-12346,Greatest show ever produced on planet Earth till now,10,"just finished watching game of thrones all 8 seasons,i know many people didn't like the show because of the season 8 but for me at least from my perspective season 8 is the best,i know may people didn't like the season finale for the tragic death of daenerys in the hand of the man she loved,but actually,i appreciated this murder,the way daenerys slaughtered thousands of innocent people in kings landing,she didn't deserve to live. many people can argue that daenerys' friend missandei was murdered,one of her child dragon was murdered so she destroyed the king's landing to avenge their death but the truth is in this series many families were slaughtered by lannisters from oberyn martell to ned stark but none of their family members slaughtered innocent people because of that.actually i think daenerys did this, because she wanted to show world,her power what she was really capable of,but at the end of the day we should always remember ""karma is a bi*ch"" and also ""pride is the root of the fall""only thing that bothered me in season 8 was the killing of night king in the hand of arya stark i didn't understand where she came from🙄 or even how she came🙄to godswoodthe ending was great,as we all know books haven't been published yet,so we can't know the real ending,without the book what the showrunners have managed to make,hats off to them and to their genius mindkeeping all the arguments beside my final verdict on the show is this is a masterpiece and till now according to me it's the greatest show ever produced on planet earth"
2021-06-26,rahulraushan-78538,One of the best series but disappointed ending,7,"in the end very disappointing things happened it should not be the end i rate 10/10 for 1,7 season and 5/10 for 8 th season. last should be changed."
2021-03-19,pramodgehlot-86708,Got is not a series It's emotion,1,"too good series too watch . insan level of acting.
it's my fav. series ever"
2020-12-27,hossamtayel,Game Of Thrones,9,"game of thrones is by far the best show i have watched, finished it in a week. i enjoyed the characters' depth and conflicts as well as all the aspects of the show. cinematography, scenes, shots, and etc. the ending however, is the only reason i rated it 9/10. it is very touching and gives the audience a touch of sympathy towards some of their favorite characters, but it made me feel that i have watched 8 seasons for a very specific purpose just to see it collapse. the legends of the iron throne destroyed by drogon, and the kings/queens fighting from season 1, die or get carried away. finally, i understand that it was also made so that there is not a possibility for another seasons but it could have been better. overall, very good ending though and very unexpected which i liked very much. the ending does not affect the legendary effect game of thrones have. thanks."

2020-10-13,gokugohan-66728,"What have you done, GoT?",10,"i hated the game of thrones final seasons... that's what people have been saying since the show ended in 2019. to be honest, i don't have problems with all the events that took place in seasons 7 and 8, but i strongly dislike how some things were developed. in that case, i will talk about daenerys becoming the ""mad queen"". however, truth be told, some characters' fate just didn't make sense at all and in that case, i will talk about jaime lannister.as previously stated, maybe disagreeing with a considerable part of the fans (or ex,fans), i don't think the idea of daenerys ""burning them all"" is disposable, but it should be better constructed. the concept behind madness being on her blood after all is certainly compelling. in fact, if you are a fan of the show, you can't deny ""this is so game of thrones"". daenerys had already prioritized her own beliefs above others' point of view, like when she decided to forcibly free slaves, although some of them were happier with their owners. however, none of those previous actions stablished that she was becoming what she has always fought against: someone who kills innocents. even when she killed randyll and dickon tarly, she offered them the option to bend the knee (since they could've been manipulated by cersei). thus, what i mean is that if there were more scenes in which she acted more villainously (e.g. leaving innocents to die because the throne was more important), maybe burning thousands of surrendered civilians and soldiers alive would be a little coherent with her character development.regarding jaime lannister, his ending was even more incoherent. having one of the best stories of the show, in my opinion, we could see a terrible selfish man turning into someone who shows his fragilities and acknowledges his mistakes. the arc in which he loses his right hand (symbol of everything he thought he was), confesses the truth about how he became the ""kingslayer"" and starts to realize that some things in life aren't black and white is simply amazing. in the great war, he even helps the north against the army of the dead - right after the touching scene in which he knigths brienne, even though a woman couldn't be knighted. in other words, this character gradually won our hearts with a mature story to die, at the end, in the arms of a toxic person that never did anything truly good to him. congrats, hbo. if you wanted to surprise us, well done.all in all, believe me when i say i'm not a hater. different from many people i've heard out there, i don't agree the final seasons ruined the whole show. of course, we have a couple of problems that i bet the got readers are expecting r. r. martin to fix, but those issues can't completely burn all the epic battles, deaths and stories to ashes (like daenerys with king's landing)."
2020-10-01,sukeerthi-36534,An intriguing story which got diluted in the final episodes,10,"after hearing rave reviews about got, i watched all the episodes without taking a long break (like 3,4days break) in between so as to actually understand the world of got. the way the initial seasons was directed and paced was very interesting and hook the audience for more of it. until season 5, i could see the way the characters and their purpose was defined even for a background artist. it was a visual grandeur and the dialogues were too good for us to decipher the actual meaning.but i felt the makers started to hurry up from season 6 without giving a proper closure for many characters not having a logical reason for any particular sub story making the viewers feel the distraction. final season had some high points as well as its lows with many sub plots unattended or left for the user's discretion. plots especially like what exactly arya do with her face changing skill except to avenge her brother's death or what will be essos after daenerys death? also jon snow's inability to take a wise decision at crucial times all made the story and the series weak.in my opinion, they could have taken the detailed approach as done in first few seasons so as to have a proper closure and a satisfying ending. over all if you are nor too much into details and logics and enjoy the screen work in terms of acting, costumes, graphics then a must watch series."
2020-10-05,ailyn-32901,Perfecy until...,8,was a master piece until last season. everything was perfect until they changed all the senses of the charecters without reason. they made past stories of the series end up being nothing.

2012-11-02,anlokke-1,Oh my God what a piece of crap!,10,"ok, so i gave this show chance given its rave reviews and very high rating on imdb. i have to say i love the graphic style and cinematography, watching it all on blu,ray disc on a 106"" projected screen in a dedicated home cinema. it is a feast for the eye and ear!but content?? after mere minutes - before the title sequence of the first episode - i am lost in glowing blue eyes and supernatural crap.i am sure this show must get its high rating from the amount of exposed lady skin and focus on sex from role-playing acne-be-fest teenage clowns that would normally run around in the (same as in the show?) woods dressed like kings, queens and darth vaders, and whose only claim to skin must be that they were close to the set when this aired.it holds absolutely no value to me. i am not interested in seeing sisters and brothers going at it with each other. or midget sex. if you are an adventure loving clown, be my guest. if you value half a bit of decency combined with just a tiny part realism, stay away.the only cool piece was when they actually included prince charming from skrek in the form of jamie lannister, played by nikolaj coaster-waldau. fit man for the comic role.piece of crap."

2020-12-24,joseanazariovelez,Waste/time,10,"what a waste of money and time, there is a big difference between being bad or not caring anymore, this is reflected when the directors dont want to listen to their customers, just like a music artist not giving a crap about the fans. cast will not say anything bad because they are young and want to continue working.if it was just bad acting or directing, the directors believe that they are better than their fans, that's what happens when you grown up a billionaire d&d and then try to do something, only people that grow up without money do great things, any sport player in the history of all sports and peter dinklage are 2 examples.what a waste!!"

""the ending is terrible."" i hoped that maybe they just had a different taste in shows than i did and the ending wouldn't be too awful, but man was i wrong! how did the writers manage to ruin such an amazing show, quite possibly the best show of all time, and certainly my favorite show up until season 8. i am so disappointed and heartbroken it's unbelievable. i wish there was some way for the final season to be remade. if this occurs in my life i could die a happy man. although the ending is terrible, i would still recommend the show to anyone, as it is brilliant, suspenseful, action packed, and the dialogue and acting is outstanding."
2021-01-22,officialronanaram,It Could've Been One Of The Best TV Shows Of All Time!,10,"this is coming from a guy who hasn't read the books. i really like game of thrones, but there are some problems, one of the reasons is the show for me is very confusing, now this is probably on my end, because i haven't read the books, which i'll probably never get round to. and just some episodes didn't really cut it for me, they killed of well,liked main characters, and sometimes there'd be days were i don't want to watch it or sometimes and just didn't want to spend the time on it, but apart from that everything was really good! the characters, the violence (there was only 1 instance of violence that was a bit too much for me) and etc. if i were to give it a rating out of 10, it would be an 8.5/10."
2021-02-05,gursimransingh-82725,Best ever,10,best show ever made.. yes last season was disappointing but inspite of that the show is beyond awesome..
2021-07-03,sherylchen,I really enjoyed it,10,"the show is just so absorbing and amazing ,everything seems so elaborate. however, the reason why i can't give it a10 is because the final season was a bit rush and the ending was not bad but not so satisfying."
2021-07-20,dvittitoe,Skip season 8 and leave it up to imagination (trust me ),9,"the best show i've ever watched up to season 8 , they rushed and the quality shows , the writing shows , i invested a large portion of my life to this show only to be disappointed sadly .thinking about writing a fan fiction remake to the ending myself if no one hops on that . please watch , great show , and watch season 8 if you must , but i did warn you !"

2021-03-05,abubakarrk,OVERVIWE OF GOT,1,"in a general assessment game of throne is said to be one of the most fascinating tv series of all time, simply because of the type of drama it brings along, and also it plot, cast and character, theme, inspiration and derivation. it stories timeline tends to send a clear message of how inspiring and educative this movie is, and more especially the personal life lessons it teaches it audience. but what is more captivating and more thriving and seems to be the journey of the movie is what surrounded on it major theme politics. the fight of the iron throne. it gives audience a gloomy aftermath of how devious politics is, if it played in the wrong way. it typically portrays in the movie how it brings a decline to the seven kingdoms especially the capital kingslanding. the ambition of power without knowing it true essence, it purposes, it objectives tends to bring anarchy and catastrophe, which eventually lead as a direct effect to it subject. a lesson that will be learn by all, even the former us president barack obama comment on that. and as for the me, the most touching theme is the bridge between the rich and the power, the series tends to portray a narrative that tells how this equation is truly unbalance, the will that has been written between the rich and the poor. since the beginning of time this has been a major problem in societies and it remedy is truly tedious to find, so the movie tells us how this thing will be constantly going back and forth. the personal life lessons been portraying in the series is what makes it the best movie of all time, and also the aspect of love, it tends to tell us that love is the strongest affection in life, it comes natural and it eventually lead to possibly everything. so in conclusion the series has attracted a lot of viewers all over the world and it has a huge praise on it acting, which eventually shows how influential this movie was, it fictional contents brings a sense of reality in audience for a greater purpose in life and a call to humanity since the starting of dawn that let love lead."

it is the story of seven families of lords who after the death of their king fight for the thrones and the crowns to become the future king of the seven crowns, they will go to war but an army of the living dead is the march to destroy the world.my opinion:
i find the séries very well scripred with a suspence that lasts in time, and the twists are unexpected. it's a simply awesome series !"
2021-03-16,ashleycalleja,Best Show Ever!,7,"this show is amazing! do not believe any of the negative comments of these reviews.i haven't been able to watch any other show and truly enjoy it. i've tried watching multiple of other shows but don't even come close to game of thrones.to start off with the story line is absolutely brilliant with an entirely different world. the series starts with a fantastic intro which gives an idea of westeros for those who haven't read the books.apart from that, the character development, acting, costumes, cgi and cinematography are also superb which is what gives this show so much life.can not forget to mention the music; hats off to ramin djawadi he's a real talent. the scenes makes them more filled with emotion or tension.expect the unexpected, with many plot twists, it will definitely be worth your time!"

2021-03-26,melvinsomto,Amazing show but later disappointing,10,"the show has very nice graphics. the actors really did a great job, they played their parts very well. it has a very outstanding and unique story. it's almost perfect but i was very disappointed at the ending."
2021-03-27,mohabdsaudi,It's a great tv show,9,it's completely great but season 8 was so bad.we hope that house of dragon come on 2022.
2021-03-28,jerfos,Binge the show for a more satisfying ending,10,"i made this account for this review. when you binge this show you can overlook many of the mistakes of the final season. watching the show over an extended period you forget a lot of character details which are necessary for the ending to make the most sense.** spoilers below ** when you binge the show you can connect dots you otherwise forget which makes the mediocre final season terrible. when you re,watch the show you notice things, live the first time arya sees a person die, she grins and you know her story has make sense the whine time. but she's not the disappointment. keys talk daenerys, the final season seemingly makes her turn from somewhat reasonable to insane in an instant, but if you pay attention she's been nuts the whole time. she's just fought it well. but there's moments from the vet beginning you see her rage, her want to watch things burn.if the end ruined this show for you, do yourself a favor and watch it again will everything you know now. pay attention to the character's. sure they rushed the end, sure there's some plot holes for the sake of tv and time, but this show as a whole is one of the greatest things to ever come from cinema. in my opinion it's meant to be an 80 hour movie, not a series of episodes watched over a period of months or years."
2021-07-03,saifx-18381,There is no word to describe the series.,10,"the series from the point of view of the dialogues and the shocks, as well as the betrayals and the drama, and the plot of the story and the narration of the events was very wonderful.rating for each season : season 1: 9.8/10

2021-03-31,ste_hen,Disappointed,10,"would have watches the whole show over and over again if it wasn't for the ending , spoilt everything."
2021-04-02,goldmannmax,One of the best shows ever made,10,"this show is just amazing. even though the last season is kind of disappointing, it would be a shame to ignore the 7 seasons before that. they were masterpieces."
2021-04-04,sujinbosekt,Considering the whole series this is best I have watched ever,10,game of thrones this is the most wonderful series i have ever seen in my life. i felt like first few episodes where some much lagging. but after that the series started to take my heart. and it started building much hope in me. it continued for at least episode 5 of the season 8 hardly but after seeing the last episode of the series i felt much upset. it broke all the built up it had made since there. i felt like an abrupt ending. it left more confusion and was hard to end. i feel like they could have made it better.1 star goes in rating because of last episode and a few if first.
2021-04-06,henryjosephfoster,The best fantasy series of all time if not the best show of all time,10,"in my opinion game of thrones is one of the best if not the best show ever made. the writers made what i and a lot of other people would consider several mistakes especially with the 8th season (there are 8 in total). but to sum it all up, just know that if you are really into maybe the lord of the rings/the hobbit or maybe a little bit of the harry potter kind of area, it takes a little of those fantasy aspects to the extreme, and throws them into a very harsh and oddly addicting universe, and although i'll admit the show has several flaws over the seasons sometimes due to this very extreme and intense nature, i want you to hear me when i seriously tell you that all of the good parts make the bad parts worth it, especially if you make it to season 6 (the last two episodes of that season are the best in the show if not in any show), is got for everyone? doubt it, no show seems to be, but it's good enough that it really is worth a try, i wouldn't watch it if blood makes you sick, if violence disturbs you. it has good moments, but a lot of it isn't for the faint of heart. with all of that said game of thrones really is a must,watch."
2021-04-06,lukemvogel,One downside...,9,"it's a shame they never finished off the series and made a season 8... in reality though, after season 7 it went so terribly i can't group them together in my mind.if it is your first time watching the series it is fantastic! but i recommend not watching the eighth season, it had different writers and just went terribly and makes no sense compared to the the rest of the series. this is just a recommendation to spare this terrible fanfiction (season 8) from ruining the rest of the show for you."
2021-07-16,mcbbszgy,GOT the GOAT,8,"game of thrones is considered to be the best tv series of all time. while many people compare game of thrones to shows like breaking bad and the sopranos i think they are completely different sides of tv, that are impossible to compare. i think game of thrones season 1,4 is the best thing i have ever seen. while season 5 and 6 might have slightly worse writing are both still amazing season 6 has so many great scenes.i am saddened by season 7 as much as it was entertaining and better than most tv shows. i have seen someone say game of thrones used to be chess and now it's tic tac toe and i completely agree. when you compare it to season 1-6 it's very disappointing and feels more like marvel avengers than the dark, mysterious and all the backstabbing we all love. game of thrones was so good as it broke from the hollywood norm not even the main characters are safe. the show came much more predictable and characters started to feel invincible meaning the show starts to lack tension and get more boring.season 8 let's just forgot this exists.overall it's my personal favourite tv series even though i do think shows like the sopranos and breaking bad are better written game of thrones just has a certain feeling that no other show has ever made me feel. i'm always nervous, sometimes laughing, sometimes horrified and sometimes i will be left with my jaw open standing in-front of my tv jumping up and down with excitement. the whole ride is like a adrenaline shot. if your thinking of watching this all i'm going to say that it's rated 9.2 on imdb for a reason."

2021-04-18,archanan-06495,Wish it never existed now after the mess it made,9,"i wish there was a way to magically to take back all the hours spent watching this show, rewatching, theorizing, speculating, watching lore videos, theory videos and even reading the books , after the way this season happened. this season eviscerated not only just the show itself but all the fans' hopes and expectations. all that effort from the cast and crew was for what? all that passion from fans worldwide was for what? the writers blundered through this season and i wonder how toxic the culture must have been for them to get error after basic error abandoning stories, characters and physics that were established in previous seasons (sometimes abandoned between episodes). were the writers not listening to criticism, feedback or ideas from the cast and the crew? i hope some time in the future there is an investigation into how such a colossal mess up was allowed to air and what horrors happened behind the scenes. until then, i will try to forget this show ever existed, unsuccessfully."

2021-09-25,corbinroe,What an Ending?,1,"i didn't start this show because i wanted to watch it, i started this show because i could not stop hearing game of thrones references in all the conversations i'd have, so i ended up thinking well if everyone is having a good time watching it i'd try it out. boy was i in for a great time binging this show, it is amazing in every way, it had a good storyline throughout the entire show, ( well most of it but that's for the end of the review) and it didn't always give you what you want which is a good thing. in different shows you can always tell what's about to happen, who's going to die, who's going to get the girl but in this one not at all, your always on your toes. i would definitely recommend this to anyone leaning weather to watch or not your in for a treat. overall i give this a 9/10 only because of its ending i'd say it was the worst ending imaginable for anyone who has invested so much time into the show but is still worth a watch."

2021-05-09,vvaann,"Review about the series ""Game of Thrones""",8,"hello everybody! i want to tell you about the series ""game of thrones"". i think if you start watching it, then you will not resist and look at all the seasons that came out. the series is based on the series of novels ""a song of ice and fire"" by george martin.seven kingdoms have long been fighting for the iron throne, for the right to rule over all kingdoms. and each applicant believes that he is special and worthy of this honor. and then, from the north, a threat comes in the form of a revived army of the dead, white walkers, to put it simply, in which no one immediately believes. war of the living with the undead.characters. they are very bright and charismatic characters, and all of them are both negative and positive. my favourite is the winterfell stark family.and the best in my opinion were john snow bastard from house of stark, jaime and the dwarf tyrion lannister. each role is played one hundred percent and each emotion is shown to the viewer in maximum detail.i recommend it for viewing, the series is addictive, there is something to see in it. you will either like the series and drag you to watch all seasons, or cause disgust or some other emotions, but you will definitely not remain indifferent!"

2021-05-19,jusdefruitkiwi,Lord Snow the best guys,6,"game of thrones is an american fantasy drama television series created by david benioff and d. b. weiss for hbo. it is an adaptation of a song of ice and fire, a series of fantasy novels by george r. r. martin, the first of which is a game of thrones. the show was shot in the united kingdom, canada, croatia, iceland, malta, morocco, and spain. it premiered on hbo in the united states on april 17, 2011, and concluded on may 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons. set on the fictional continents of westeros and essos, game of thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. the first major arc concerns the iron throne of the seven kingdoms of westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. a second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to essos and is plotting a return and reclaim the throne. the third follows the night's watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond westeros's northern border. 20/20 guys go watch this uwu."

2021-05-21,deepdishcorbsilish,I have trust issues with TV shows now...,10,"game of thrones was my entire life for the better part of 3 years. i talked about it so frequently and it was easily in my honest opinion the best thing on television by far. seasons 1,6 are some of the most clever and best things i've seen pretty much ever. i mean great acting, well written dialouge, amazing characters, and so on and so forth. i can't believe even in 2021 that i'm sitting here and i'm saying that the ending is insulting. it's not the ""worst"" ending even to a tv show standpoint by definition. i mean it still looks fantastic, the acting is still pretty damn good, and the music of season 8 is absolutely perfect. the issue lies in the characters being a shell of what they were in prior seasons and the awful writing.in conclusion. i've started to watch a lot of great tv shows recently like mad men, breaking bad, the handmaids tale, etc and few things have come even close to my love for the first 4 seasons of game of thrones and i still think game of thrones is my personal favorite show but.. the ending is left as the most disappointing thing ever created in terms of media i've ever seen. that being said season's 1-4 are amazing! 10/10. season 5 is rocky but still game of thrones. season 6 is slow but the last two episodes are so good that it might be the closest thing to perfectionin my eyes. season 7 is honestly rough but still pretty good. season 8 is so insulting that it plagues my nightmares. 8/10 and honestly still worth your time to watch the early seasons. just make up your own ending :p."

2021-07-06,johannaefischer,"Season 1 being pure briliance, gradual decline thereafter (from very mild to EPIC)",7,"the myth of got being a perfect show exept for a terribly rushed last season is just that: a myth. many have already debunked it, yet it's still a popular and simple version i see around here. i for one saw a brilliant first season,-added scenes were building on complex characters (like robert's and cersei's exchange and toast to their dreadful marriage), a witty, enjoyable second one with some minor strays (changing robb's love interest actually poses problems for the narrative), a great third season (hello, red wedding! hello jaime's confession in the bathtub!) with some poor choices (""mhysa"" ends really clumsy and way uncomfortable with its ""white savior"" imagery), then a quite an unbalanced fourth season, especially after the epic purple wedding (tysha practically being left out starts the absolute decline of tyrion's character arc). season 5 manages to run out of steam pretty fast with its horrendous dorne plot and snail-like tyrion arc (this is when he's starting being severely dumbed down), and whatdayyaknow! that's just when the source material starts running out on d&d's as well. what a coincidence (not really).season 6 is already a different show, with occasional great moments (cersei's final act to secure power), but more in terms of filmmaking than writing or character building (her blowing up the sept has no consequence , which is insane for a show that used to be deeply rooted in realpolitik). everything is bigger in budget and production value, but it's hardly better. got just grew more and more popular regardless, because apparently people gathered in bars to watch it (seriously?) and needed explosions to cheer at.season 7, oh well... it pretty much set the stage for the laughable dumpsterfire that was season 8 (""beyond the wall"" only being the most glaring example of tragic writing). another epic drop in quality? sure. but hardly the only thing the show failed at. almost nothing worked and was confusing and uninspired (ed sheeran wasn't helping either, but i guess it ain't his fault). just showed how much the show got swallowed up by its own popularity and desire to hype itself up even more.it's a great show or its first 3,5 seasons or so, at least for me. fantastic actors, of course, and a beautiful job done by so many people--except the showrunners who clearly had other priorities and lack of skill to pull this (admittedly massive beast) off."
2021-07-06,ediciondeinformes,Please remake last season.,10,"game of thrones is in my opinion best serie ever made ( until the last season at least ). characters are so well done, i'm amazed by the quantity of characters they made without making a mess ,developing them all almost perfectly. each story could be an independent story but they all were written to perfectly exist in synchrony. there a lapse of time between ss 4 and 6 where everything is perfect, it was a constant feeling of satisfaction that i never felt before in a serie. it's a shame that the last season feels disappointing, it's not the worst ending but an amazing serie deserves a better end for those characters that we loved for such long a time."
2021-07-20,foehrenbach,Would have been 11/10 if there wasnt Season 8,10,"i personally hate that the show gets so much hate for its last season. i get that a lot of people have their problems with it and so do i, but that just doesnt take away how great the other seasons are. i actually would consider this show to be the best thing i have ever watched on tv.brilliant story, the best dialogue scenes i have ever seen, brilliant acting, great choreographies and special effects, but what i love most about this series is that it plays with your feelings so much. this is the first time ive seen a story where noone is safe. sometimes after certain episodes you sit there for an hour, thinking, before you can get back into reallife.this is a love letter to the best show i have ever watched and will be the last and only review i will ever write.10/10."
2021-07-14,odinsneuesdrude,Lots of time spent going no where,7,"read the book.....avoid it. it doesn't have an ending.watched the show.some good characters and i enjoyed how there were multiple story,lines going on at the same time.but, the whole knights and ladies and stuff kind of starts to wear thin around season 5.in the end i feel like the its much ado about nothing. kind of disappointed by it. no heroic ending or triumphant conclusion. for me, it just falls short of being memorable and that is a let down having spent some time invested in seeing it through to the finish.some good moments but i only ever got excited or wanted to continue watching a handful of times. for an 8 season show that's not enough.hate to say but if you are going to commit 80 hrs of your life to something, don't make it this. it's more tragedy than comedy and there is no real takeaway. swipe left."
2021-07-20,qcgyyspn,One of the best tv show ever,10,i know that season 8 took a very wrong turn but and don't think that it should lower my overall rating. i love this show with all my heart and nothing can change that. i think everyone should always look at the good parts. i mean yeah we all watched season 8 i am sure we all deserved a better ending but we have this and its not going to change. i am sure everyone had their good moments watching the show and i think that's the important thing. we love the show and we should always look at the good parts.

2019-05-20,purrr-fectangel,Not going to lie don't watch it.,2,"having been a massive game of thrones fan for years, invested heavily in merchandise, games and so on you can imagine my horror at the series ending many years early right after the writers accepted contracts to write three star wars films. they actually ended the show early to go do something else. totally a disappointment if you aren't already into the show don't bother."
2011-05-17,shebs1,Worth the wait.,10,"one of the best things about certain books is that, for me, they lead to pleasant, but not vapid escapism, and the song of ice and fire always fitted that bill for me. as a historian, the grittiness bypasses all those silly notions of a romantic, bucolic mediaeval period.television adaptations, such as this one, must take certain liberties, but here they have been, for the most part, subtle enough to not be jarring or irritating. the only one of note so far that concerned me was the ""outing"" of renly and loras tyrell so blatantly. the subtlety of the book was much better and allowed a better introduction for characters who are important later on, namely brienne and margery tyrell. that said, i wont worry too much about it.the characters are well drawn, with decent personalities that reflect the shades of grey in real life. even the most venal characters have some redeeming features which are not brought in apologetically. their character is allowed to stand without such self,conscious presentation. obviously certain parts of the books could not be easily filmed, or legally filmed, but the main atmosphere is still there.to my mind it is preferable to lord of the rings, to which all fantasy seems to be compared. i enjoyed lotr, book more than films, i just prefer this to either though i do wish the books would come faster! for myself, i would recommend exploring this excellent series. have some care as to the depicted violence, both against humans and animals. it certainly did not bother me, but i know some people might be disturbed by some of the imagery."

2011-05-18,tecnodoc32,From book to Screen - Flawless,10,"*** this review may contain spoilers ***this can be a great series, it truly can. and i hope it will be. it is imported for me to state,just like everyone else does that it stays very true to the books. this is both a blessing and a curse. as anyone can see almost all reviews here are done by fans of the books. i myself have read the books, but i am no fan. as for me, i hope the series will not completely copy the books total lack of plot. the white walkers – seen in the start of the pilot – will they have a role to play? or will they like in the books first be heard from again in 200 episodes time. if the series stays true to the books we will get just what they where – ""days of our lives"" set in the middle ages. containing lots of hate, betrayal, penthouse forum letters, betrayal, intrigue, betrayal and betrayal. with any shadow of a plot finely gets brutally murdered and has a wolfs head sown on its shoulders instead of its own head did i mention betrayal?but the series starts well enough, awesome location shots and lots of great actors. that some of the characters are a little flat is not the fault of the actors. it is to early to tell if the style holds out or if they decide to put in a plot. it would create an uproar from the fans of the books – but it would also make for a much better show. as one reviewer puts it, ""the series revolves around eddard stark and his family. he has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. eddard stark is ruler of the north and close friend of king robert who needs his help in ruling the seven kingdoms.""*** major spoiler don't read on *** hard to say how they would handel the early death of both characters. time will tell"

2021-10-10,mementomoriua,A Tapestry Of Music And Story,8,"the iconic motto of house stark, ""winter is coming,"" as first said by the beloved fan,favorite character eddard ""ned"" stark, easily captures the viewers' attention. they serve as a warning and foreshadow the darkness and evil that lurk in upcoming episodes. three simple words that unwittingly take a seemingly typical epic fantasy series; and transform it into something unique. ""a song of ice and fire,"" also commonly known as simply ""game of thrones,"" is a fantastical political drama with a dash of ""chosen one"" elements and iconic characters beloved and cherished by fans around the globe. the game of thrones series is one of the best and most popular epic fantasy series ran on international television and might be one of the best fantasy stories of all time.game of thrones is based on the ""a song of ice and fire"" book series, written by george r. r. martin starting with ""a game of thrones"" beginning in 1991 and was published in 1996, most recently, ""a dance with dragons"" in 2011 with ""the winds of winter"" currently in the works and ""a dream of spring"" being planned to be written in the future. george r. r. martin, david benioff, and d. b. weiss, co-creators of the game of thrones tv series, have gone on record stating the inspirations for the books and the tv series were the wars of the roses from 22 may 1455 - 16 june 1487 and ""the accursed kings,"" a novel by french author maurice druon.the series takes on a segmented approach and style when telling the main characters' stories as their adventures progress over the continents of westeros and essos, changing from one to the next, which could be confusing to newcomers to the series. one moment you could be overseeing the point of view of tyrion lannister as he navigates the perils of the kings' court in kings landing, another moment you could be witnessing a battle fought beyond the wall by jon snow, then finally cheering on daenerys targaryen as she leads her army to bring down a patriarchal society that runs on the enslavement of women and children. all the stories are told in a way that may seem confusing and at times may even be perceived as not having much of a purpose, but seemingly innocent or non-important actions and conversations of one character may have severe consequences and ramifications later on in the same episode or even several seasons on for another character; demanding the viewer pay close attention to every detail and conversation on screen.one reason game of thrones is a fantastic tv series is the characters themselves; after all, there would be no series or show without the characters. most of the main characters hail from one of four noble houses; the baratheons with a banner of a crowned black stag on a golden field, the starks with a grey direwolf on a white field, the lannisters with a golden lion on a crimson field, and the targaryens with a blood-red three-headed dragon on a black field, with the house sigils even becoming characters of themselves. when you see a banner of three black dogs on a yellow field, for example, an avid fan may instantly recognize that of house clegane, or you may catch a glimpse of a banner of a golden rose on a green field and know that's for house tyrell. and among the four noble houses, the most popular characters are daenerys targaryen, who is instantly recognizable with her silver hair; tyrion lannister with an iconic wit and attitude perfectly summarized in his well-known phrase, ""i drink and i know things"", arya stark the adventurous tomboy who becomes a terrifying assassin, and jon snow a globally beloved heartthrob; with other fan favorites being from some of the lesser-known and smaller houses and even from beyond the wall like tormund giantsbane the wildling raider, the before mentioned khal drogo, brienne of tarth, oberyn martell of house martell, olenna tyrell and her granddaughter margaery tyrell of house tyrell.another reason game of thrones is so wildly popular is how unpredictable the characters' fates become. the series has become widely known as one where few characters are guaranteed to live through the end of the eight seasons. (knight) even though the final episode of the game of thrones tv series, many other characters meet their fates in one way or the other. some characters are resigned to a simple hanging off-screen or even tragically and graphically being burned to death after a false prophecy misled another character. the many deaths kept many viewers hooked by the burning question, ""will so-and-so die?"" finally, one of the draws of the show being so beloved is the setting and music used during the episodes. the central locations of westeros and essos are filled with incredible amounts of lore and provide an extraordinary sense of life to the world. the house of the undying; a spire whose insides itself become a mind-bending labyrinth, harrenhal, the ruins of a castle whose very stone walls were melted by dragon fire like ice on a hot day, the intimidating ice wall of the north that is maintained by old forgotten magics to keep out the white walkers/others and wildlings beyond the walls; not a single location is placed wastefully; every name on the map and said by characters in passing providing a key ingredient to a living and breathing world with some locations being instantly recognizable, like the red keep of kings landing; or the elegantly terrifying moon door in high hall of the eyrie. then critically crucial to creating the emotions and atmosphere for the show is the music created by ramin djawadi; every scene is highlighted and enhanced by iconic scores like ""the rains of castamere"" used during the infamous red wedding; and the haunting ""light of the seven"" during the explosion of the sept of baelor. the music beautifully and expertly enhances the flavor of the scenes viewed by the audience, and even giving an additional flavor for what may be happening on-screen; with pounding drums enhancing on-screen, adrenaline-filled battles, or soft violin stings expressing the grief and sorrow of a character. every moment utilizes sound and on some occasions the lack of sound to convey key elements of a character's motivations, their plans, or even calling back to a prior episode.in conclusion; through the masterful craftmanship of excellent characters, fantastic world lore, and score provided through the show; the game of thrones series written by george r. r. martin and the accompanying tv series co-created by david benioff and d. b. weiss is one of the best epic-fantasy stories of all time; and certainly should snag a place on everyone's ""must watch"" list at some point."

2012-04-02,seppemexico,Is there a story?,10,"games of thrones,well it is a series that has excellent:1. photography 2. soundtrack 3. astonishing women and men as actors 4. great costumes and many more things but... does someone agree that the story hasn't gone nowhere after 11 episodes? it is very slow and in each episode there hardly happens something and we are getting to any certain point. i hope this will change very soon because if not it will be a big fluke. the same thing happened with the second series of boardwalk empire and i presume hbo is trying to make a lot of money with long stretched series abandoning there usual quality and amazing productions.because the story lines are weak i only give it a 7.5/10"

2012-07-15,azhitsky,Mindless violence and misplaced nudity,7,"after watching the first season i have not been able to emotionally connect with a single line or character. it seems that the dwarf is the most sympathetic figure, every one else being either weak or false or dead by the end of the season. the plot is chaotic. amount of violence is on par with spartacus: blood and sand. nudity is corruptive and mostly unjustified. power is the name of the game. sean bean is probably the best actor in the series. yet, this is far off his performance in lor. the only thing i could connect with were beautiful landscapes of malta where some scenes were shot. i would rather recommend rome series, which has a superior plot line and character build."
2019-05-06,gelboy06,best tv series ever,9,amazing storyline hope they have a prequel👍🙏..............................
2019-05-27,anaceciliadmm,The ending is worst than Lost's,2,"this is a series that could be an eternal achievement, a clássica, but the horrible script of the last season was the end of it. we saw the problems coming when the creators ran out of books to adapt, but it was not all lost. season 7 das kinda stupid with that plan of bringing a wight to cersei, all the plot holes and horrible solutions, like that giant chain coming from the frozen lake to pull off the dragon. it's really sad because the effects, make up, stunts, art direction, cinematography, acting, and the sound score are amazing. poor team that had to put um with this d&d megalomaniac goals for this season and could not write a decent script"
2011-05-27,paul_bejenar,Waste,10,"good show. i like that the show kept close with the books. but i think ""the song of ice and fire"" deserved more. if hbo built a small part of rome for the similar show, they could have invested more here. maybe they were hit by the crisis or they simply failed to foresee the great potential of the story. i understand they can't afford the lotr visual effects or john woo for fighting scenes, but all that close filming angles and the lack of panorama create a feeling that we're watching a theater play on a stage. almost all the scenes (e.g.: the wall, the hand tournament, the cloud castle) could have offered much more greatness with just a few extra money (or maybe imagination). i'm afraid to think how the epic battles scenes will look (if any). i'm sure got brings enough audience to hbo (the book fans community is large enough) to make them invest more in the following series."
2019-05-18,beltarrow,1-6 wonderful - 7 watchable - 8 total crap,10,"i came across this series quite by chance and i got hooked at once. as an avid d&d player and a fantasy fan, i couldn't not be mesmerized by this show. it had everything i always thought a fantasy tv show should have.this show was wonderful! i went through seasons 1,6 in awe.then came season 7.. the first half was mainly ok but the second half things started to go downhill, slowly at first and then faster. i started having the first doubts about the progression of the series.nevertheless i agonized in waiting the final season. i was willing to accept any resolution (and still am) as long my intelligence wasn't insulted and the characters remained true to theirselves.then season 8 arrived and oh, boy, what a letdown! what a letdown!idiotic plots, lazy writing, characters out of.. well.. character.yes, acting is still good, photography and art direction are still a wonder (well, let us forget the heavy darkness of episode 3) but the story has no meaning anymore. i still have the last episode to watch and i simply stopped caring.intelligent characters are reduced to idiots; battles with no strategy nor anyone directing them (dothraki, what were you thinking?), actions done by the characters that have no reason at all. it seems like the screenwriters of seasons 1-6 were replaced by a bunch of amateurs with dumb ideas...i am very very sorry because this show had all the chances to become legendary. it deserved it. instead, it won't."
2019-04-17,doozer-9,Greatest Show you will ever see,1,"people talk about a once in a lifetime event and i can assure you that this is one of them, this is the greatest show you will ever see. i took some convincing to initially watch, but 5 minutes in i was addicted, nearly as bad as my coffee addiction. if you havent watched your life is not completed, it's one for the bucket list."
2013-06-02,xtempore,Great Casting and Visually Stunning,10,"as a big fan of the ""a song of ice and fire"" series i was thrilled when hbo announced this series, but also somewhat ill,at-ease after having seen so many other much loved books ruined in screen adaptations.overall i think hbo have done an outstanding job, especially in the area of casting. the characters come across almost exactly as i imagined them in the books, and some even better. in particular i've been hugely impressed with the work of jack gleeson as joffrey. i seriously want to strangle that little $%^* - which is kinda the point!the visuals are also stunning, with dragons, giants, and white walkers seamlessly integrated into the scenes.of course, as with any die-hard fan i have my gripes. the replacement of jeyne westerling with talisa maegyr, seemed clumsy and unnecessary. it appears that the producers wanted a more ""romantic"" storyline.the omission of strong belwas is also disappointing, and leaves me wondering how they will cover some of his role in future parts of the story.but these complaints are minor, and certainly do little to diminish the overall mastery of this story by the cast and crew, for what is surely one of the most talked about tv shows in history, inspiring a multitude of only fan sites - and even an online coloring book (http://www.gameofthronescoloringbook.com)!"
2012-03-04,memms,Damn Awesome - Watch it or Earn the Wrath of Arya Stark!,10,"i know i am bit late to write the review but...this show is damn awesome. the location, the characters, the targeriyans, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet,wolves, the night's watch, the wall, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the noob who becomes the king, the cunning lannisters, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word khal drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon baelish, and much much more!i don't generally prefer tv shows because they run too long and the story keeps never ends. luckily my friend recommended that since entire season 1 is out there, why not watch it all? here's the twist, each episode is a master-piece. i watched first episode, my mind blew-off in bewilderment of the 'pure' violence & love, the characters displayed to play the game of thrones. the baratheon king is a extremely cunning character, who never takes the center stage and yet remains purely in power. the starks are the most lovable family with an unfathomable family pride. the all-powerful lannisters, a family or kingdom in themselves. the bastard dwarf is one of best characters i have ever seen in any tv show. a character so tiny yet so powerful. tyrion lannister's dialogue delivery & portrayal of 'the bastards' is absolutely stunning. he is chatty and witty, probably the only lannister without the trademark characteristics of a lannister!and i could go on and on about the other characters!more than anything, all episodes remains absolutely loyal to the title, 'game of thrones'."
2011-06-20,kcsusan-3,King Joffrey played by Jack Gleeson,10,"i have watched every episode of this intriguing, beautifully done series. i am very impressed with the top quality acting that comes across with every person in the series. i am particularly fond of peter dinklage and jack gleeson (king joffrey). they are definitely a notch above spectacular. jack gleeson should become famous after this show, this kid is extremely talented. he is playing his bad guy part to the hilt. i put him in the class of jason issacs of braveheart and alan rickman as sheriff of notingham in the kevin costner robin hood movie. he does such despicable acts with the glee and enjoyment much like alan rickman. i would love to see him do many different roles, to display talents for all types of films. good luck to you, what a future you have mr. gleeson."
2011-04-18,fallingwaters999,Severely disappointed......,8,"i thought the pilot episode was over,hyped.i'm a huge fan of the books. i have been waiting for this show to debut for months, sean bean being one of my favorite actors.i thought the locations were beautiful and the locations drop-dead gorgeous. i didn't expect lord of the the rings. the books do contain a moderate amount of sex, a large amount of violence and are written in contemporary english, swear words and all. the fact that the books are like this is part of the appeal. the characters are real, flawed and speak just the way we do, but the focus is always on the relationships between characters and factions. not just on sex or violence. fantasy fiction for the modern adult reader.this is not what i watched last night.....in one hour-long program there were at least two rapes, twenty women naked from the top up (several completely naked), one blatant sex scene and several partially obscured scenes. i sat on the couch next to my husband with my face burning (which has never happened to me). he said the show was pornographic and confusing. he never read the books.the books are not for children, and on hbo i expected sex, violence and swearing. but the level they took it to, detracted from the plot of the story. several of my friends that i asked to watch this texted me stating how confused they are over the shifting scenes, and large amount of cast members that were barely introduced. other shows that i have watched and loved on hbo did not have this large amount of sex. even sex and the city. i will watch one more episode but if it was anything like last night's then i give up!"

2019-05-20,baum-jeremy,The Pack Survives,10,"all good things must come to an end. goodbye game of thrones, one of the greatest tv shows ever made. a phenomenal 8 seasons, i have a few grumbles with the speed of season 8, however what they delivered overall was incredible. to the cast and crew, thank you so much for an epic ride, that has captivated myself, my friends and endless conversations at work!"
2011-04-25,sonofdelbert,Great Book Adaptation,10,"i have read game of thrones more than once, and i am exceptionally pleased with the hbo adaptation thus far. i just finished watching episode 2. i find the actors to be nearly perfectly suited for the book's characters. the book is rather slow, with a lot of character complexity and social intrigue. the television series adapts this very well by presenting the most poignant moments from the book, the ones that capture the essence of a character or the mood of a scene. my wife does not like fantasy, but she is completely captivated by this series. the story is more true to the many shades of human nature than, say, ""lord of the rings"" or other popular fantasy fare. therefore it transcends the limits of its genre and will appeal to fantasy aficionados and non,geeks alike. it is also dark, raw, and realistic. therefore trees don't whistle tunes and good guys don't always end up on top. as a fan of the books, based on the first two episodes alone, i believe that hbo has done an outstanding job of adapting george r.r. martin's ""game of thrones"" to television. i highly recommend watching this series."
2016-07-14,kristinadamnjanovic,Breathtaking!,10,"i have resisted watching this show for so long, but i have succumbed to the madness... and i must say that i am entirely mesmerized! i'm someone who prefers comedy to any other genre (mainly because this life is dark enough, so i'd rather have some laughter)... the first episode i saw was s06e09 battle of the bastards (it was an accident, i was with ""the wrong crowd"") and the next day i was just too intrigued, and mostly baffled, cause i had no idea who's who, etc. anyway, i never write reviews or anything, but since that day, it took me 7 days (and nights) to watch the entire show (i basically canceled all my plans and went on hbo go to watch it) and i just had to share my love for this show! p.s. i'm off to buy the books and read them asap!

2020-03-25,rahuliit2003,"You love it, you're shocked by it, and then you hate it by the end",1,"a great watch if you like the sword,and-sorcery / kings-and-knights / medieval age genre.the show contains a lot of sex, swearing, incest and violence. if you're put off by any of that, got is not for you.seasons 1-5 get a perfect 10 on 10. season 6 is still good, though it's not as good as the previous seasons.
seasons 7-8 is when the writing went down the drain and d&d ruined the show and their own reputation beyond redemption."
2019-05-14,sinpapgreen,Season 8 not the best...but..,1,"enough with the dissapointed reviews! the series will get a good ending. now that we've seen the targaryen queen go mad, i'm ok with all of it. i hope she burns them all. stop being dissapointed things aren't going the way you thought they would and enjoy your favorite show! good luck waiting for martin to finish writing the books! and have you read them? they weren't going anywhere."
2011-04-21,adrijan_m,The perfect start,10,"i will first present to you my circumstances so that you can judge whether this review may accurately reflect your own opinion. after all, we read reviews so that we know whether to watch/read or not. so here goes; 23, read the books, enjoy fantasy, but hate it when fantasy fiction is turned into fairytale. movies about the uglier side of humanity should be ugly. i also like sushi.now , the series.it's ugly. and perfect. it is so wonderfully realistic, i'd say, that one's understanding of medieval life is altered forever.while not breath-taking, the visuals are satisfying. fantasy essentials such as the stone architecture and feudal attire are presented superbly. action-scenes are kept short and precise and none of the gory details are left out. the prettier aspects of the film - some of which having read the book, i naively envisaged more gloriously - are done to perfection, even to the corny physical depiction of jaime, whom in my opinion resembles prince charming from shrek.the principles of the series are also done very well. barbarism and lust are portrayed very effectively. the nudity is not eye-candy, and much like the gore, it has you cringing at its vulgarity. loyalty and friendship dominate the emotional landscape, as do their evil twins, betrayal and hatred. most significantly however, the theme of family is put into the limelight and tested. all in all, feudal relationships and values are explored by the game of thrones to a level of quality only matched by the novels.a quick word on the plot. having seen only the inaugural episode, i cannot accurately gauge its whole quality, but having read the book, i can safely attest that if the series continues to present the story as faithfully as it has so far, it will leave the viewer breathless and deeply furious at the weekly nature of delivery of television viewing.perhaps the only thing not meeting the sublime standard of the whole, is the score. the music is dull, quite frankly. perhaps in this aspect, the overly realistic nature of the series is damaging. i mean, sure, the barbaric horselords are synonymous with tribal drum beats, but a guitar riff to emphasize their bad-assness could not have gone wrong, in my opinion.in summary however, this series has made the perfect start. with some luck, and under the careful guidance of george rr martin, it will hopefully continue on its epic journey in the same manner it has so far, awesomely."
2013-06-04,tonyneculai,There are now too many plans of action,10,"i really liked the 1,st season, it was great and it had everything. season 2 was a bit of disappointment and in season 3 it keeps going like season 2.the general feeling is there are too many plans of action, and actually if you summarize en episode not much happens. an episode has one hour, and you have in season 3 maybe 10-12 plans of action, this means 5 minutes per plan - well not much happens as there is no physical time and everything goes forward very slow and it is kind of boring.and there are still new characters which appear in the movie. it is sad as this is ruining the movie. it is a good idea to have a complex movie with plans which intersects at certain point and have a connection, but you should keep it more simple, as from an action point of view i don't feel the dynamic of the movie, everything became static. i kind of lost the desire to see the movie. i thought is only my problem but i spoke with friends who are watching but they said the last 2 seasons are pretty boring, but they couldn't really say why.i gave a 9 as a mark for first season, but i can't go higher than 7 for the next two seasons. i only look now because i got used with the characters.i also feel a central character is missing from the movie. in the first season i felt ned stark was closer to something like this. but maybe this is the idea, not to have one.anyway, i hope my review will reach the right eyes and maybe they fix season 4(maybe kill some characters). there shouldn't be more the 6-7 plans in a movie, at least 10 minutes per action should be shown in one episode."
2011-04-30,bokbokbok81,As good as it gets!,2,"as far as entertainment goes, this is a must watch. book,and tv-series both. if you are browsing these parts of the woods (imdb, and forum) you cannot do yourself justice by passing up a song of fire and ice: game of thrones.it has everything any average viewer might enjoy; great irish scenery, a marvelous cast, each and every acting contribution flawlessly incorporated into this vast, epic saga of perfected genuine storytelling. modern/urban fantasy story at it's grandest, incredibly visceral and layered characters, the effects are top-notch, some small essence of mystical, fantastical magic in the background, beautiful script mostly staying true to it's father, a song of ice and fire by r.r. martin. and the great effort done on the details, making the lands of vesteros, mind-numbingly real.10/10 as good as it gets."
2017-07-16,nageltr,Stupid Stunt Casting,10,deducting a star for including the horribly untalented ed sheeran in the season 7 opener. game of thrones should not stoop to ridiculous stunt casting. i will give the star back if someone chops off his head. i will completely delete this review if there is a published apology on top of that.
2019-05-20,mampire,When ending ruins an entire series,6,"for a series with such a complexity, many,layered characters, contradicted emotions & breathtaking events. you'd expect to get an epic ending but that wasn't the case with game of thrones which has an end that ruined it all & made rewatchability almost impossible. even the worst pessimists wouldn't ever imagined a series that acquired all this glory & hype to end up so terribly.shame on the writers to turn such a rich world & complicated structure into a pale & dumb pop-ish work at the last 2 seasonsseasons 1-6 outstanding. season 7 that's when the dumb writing has begun. season 8 dumb writing has taken a whole new level, butchering all characters arcs & betraying the previous complexity of the world.if you're new to the series do yourself a favor & stop watching after season 6."
2019-05-03,suziwoodgate,Best thing on TV ever!,10,didn't start watching until season 7 but so glad i did! can't believe i didn't watch when it first came out but wow! amazing!
2012-05-04,my_name_is_cba,Too much overrated ..!,10,"9.4 is just a much overrated point for this show.what kind of pleasure did you get from this?this is just not right when you compare this show to other great shows..!it just shows kingdoms simultaneously and goes on like ""the bold and the beautiful"" in middle age.no action, no excitement until season 2, episode 5...!!!please be a bit objective about this show.those who adore ""game of thrones""because of the next possible episodes, do not give the people who has still not watched it, the wrong idea.that is all i want to say!"
2011-10-12,danicl07,Why these additional SCENES?,8,"well i must say i was pleasantly surprised the first few episodes of this series as to how well it represented the book. i thought the casting was outstanding, the acting impressive and the scenes beautifully executed. one of those few novel,to-screen adaptations that represented exactly what the author portrayed. however, the most recent episode i've watched(epi 5 the wolf and the lion) disappointed and shocked me! firstly-the homosexual relationship between renly and loras was not only an addition not mentioned in the book but didn't seem to add anything to the plot. if anything, i am concerned it will complicate the storyline and betrays their characters! renly is self conscious and whiney-not reflective of his robust and outgoing personality in the book, and in the book loras was a hit with the ladies so i don't see what the purpose of adding that was. don't misinterpret this as homophobia of any sort, i simply feel it was untrue to the book. and the second scene that bothered me was between cersei and robert. there was never such an intimate and friendly encounter between them represented anywhere in the book as the scene where she practically counseled him on his decision to attack dany. this scene in the show portrayed them, while not as in love, as friendly and almost a mutual respect that completely contradicts with their relationship. the robert in the book would never have listened to her and she couldn't have stood to have spoken to him without the acrid and sarcastic demeanor she always appears to exhibit towards him. up to the point i've been so impressed but frankly this episode outrages me! mr martin signed off on this??? i hope this episode is an exception and it will resume its close reliance on the actual story as he wrote it so well."

2012-09-02,frankonsteen,A superbly written drama leagues away from the rest of the common droll of television.,10,"i've read every book in martin's series a song of ice and fire (a game of thrones) and let me say so far the show does a good job in keeping the spirit alive with only slight adaptations. the characters are very well casted and portray the characters from the book series brilliantly. the rawness and edginess of the show is fitting for that time period and brings the viewer back to the medieval times. the only advice i can give is that to truly understand the show (as well as the book series) is to study and remember the details, the characters, and their allegiance. this is a very dynamic story with many characters all of whom share an important part of the story."
2018-03-19,sorinsuba,"Thank you, GRRM, D&D and the cast&crew",1,"eight seasons is ok for a show like this. after s5 you don't get any shocking surprises, there are some, but we just got used to the got,grrm style. at this point we can predict the story because we have enough information, it is not a mystery anymore. we need fresh blood, new stories, new amazing actors, characters, i can't wait for all those rumored 4-5 prequels. got has been a lovely emotional roller coaster, we love it, it changed our lives a little bit. it changed our perspective of a good show, quality not quantity. it is time to go. let the prequels begin!"
2011-05-04,bjason82,A true masterpiece,1,"the producers of this series have, so far, done a spectacular job. as a fan of the books (yes, i've read them all), the visual depictions of the characters and the scenery are spot,on with with how i had imagined they would appear (except jamie lannister and i don't know why!). however, i am amazed at the popularity of this series. i say this because, as i watch each episode, i couldn't imagine anyone truly being able to follow the storyline unless they've read the books. there is such a mountain of internal dialog and details that are not conveyed by film -- which is true with most book-to-film renditions. watching the series after having read the books makes for a highly entertaining experience. george r. r. martin is, without a doubt, a master of his craft. if not, the master of his craft. 'genius' and 'masterful' are the words i use to describe martin's masterpiece of literature {and film}.the hbo series should easily be enjoyed on its own merit, but i highly recommend that everyone read the books before watching the series -- it will greatly enhance the experience."
2019-05-17,gabor-kurthy,"Season 8 - ""dream season""",10,"i think season 8 could be made a ""dream season"" just like when season 9 of dallas proved to be the dream of pamela, beginning from the death of bobby ewing.in case of got it could be bran stark who has this very unpleasant dream."
2014-08-10,melissathomatz,I am obsessed!!,10,"i felt the need to add my two cents simply because of the (somewhat few) negative reviews posted on imdb. the only criticism i can accept is the fact of much female nudity, compared with no full frontal male nudity, a strange yet common phenomenon not in any way limited to this series. other than that, got is what so many others have accurately described: possibly the most beautifully filmed, addictive tv show ever produced. the acting is simply superb, on all levels. this is one show that could be truly described as having an ensemble cast, and to that end, no actor/actress seems to outshine the others. all are excellent and seem to truly understand their character's motivations. i have also read the books which were truly fantastic, although at times long. i could not even have imagined it possible that a tv show could be so true to the books and yet almost exceeding the quality of the books. the few plot variations from book to show tend to make sense in terms of making the series watchable and in light of the time restrictions for each season. the people responsible for casting show really deserve a lot of credit. i am absolutely blown away by how well each character is translated to the screen and which actors are chosen for each part. in addition, as other reviewers have noted, the production values and special effects are second to none. of course, a lot of people die in the show and i was sad to that sean bean had only one season. but, oh, did he make good use of it! i'm sure everyone has their favorites, i personally think the actors who play lord baelish (littlefinger), lord varys and stannis baratheon are just amazing. but then, who isn't, on got? ultimately, the real reason for the brilliance of this series is some truly unforgettable moments. so many movies and tv shows are enjoyable, but i end up not thinking much about them after they have ended. not so with got. i laud the producers for taking it seriously enough to produce a truly meaningful, important work of art. there will always be haters and naysayers, i am glad that so many people appreciate this show. thanks hbo, for making me so happy!!!!"
2019-05-13,kandacehayes,I'm kinda addicted,7,"ive never been this hardcore about a show before, but here i am even writing a review. ive watched s01,s07 3x already, and will probably watch all of them again next year."
2019-05-21,rasmusrajasalo,One of the best book adaptations turned into fanfiction mediocrity,10,"the first four seasons of got were brilliant, almost perfect adaptations of a song of ice and fire. as the budget (and popularity) grew bigger and bigger, so did problems regarding writing.season 5 had many major changes and left out even more characters and events than the previous seasons. anyone claiming that the writers ""ran out of source material"" fails to understand that two of the five books were never properly adapted. the last three seasons look and sound like got, but feel like a totally different series, especially the last two seasons. the witty dialogue between smart, interesting and well,written characters was replaced with silly one-liners and ruined character arcs, and the deep lore and the mysteries of the world became an afterthought.i wish they had done seven (or at the very least six) seasons based on the books 1-5. seasons 5 and 6 could've followed the events of the fourth and fifth book, and season 7 could've been the second half of book five. what we got instead (s5) was merely a rushed summary of two massive novels.ever since season 5, got became increasingly disappointing and laughable, leading up to one of the worst conclusions in the history of television. the final three seasons are high budget mediocrity, fanfiction written by d&d who, instead of adapting the source material, decided to create their own action-packed farce. what an epic waste of opportunity and talent.dear grrm, do hurry up with the books please.here is some raw data for the nerds:book chapters used directly in got (%) book 1, 97%book 2, 83%book 3, 82%book 4, 35%book 5, 33%book chapters not used in got (%)

2011-06-13,gabriellevb,"Brilliant writing, brilliant actors, brilliant editing",10,"i wanted to wait with reviewing the series until i have seen at least a couple of episodes. today i watched the second to last episode of the first season (episode 9). i am amazed and flabbergasted how incredibly brilliant this show is written, how amazing the actors act and the editing has been done.when watching the first 5 minutes of episode one i already fell in love with it. it feels like you're watching a movie, rather than a series. although if it had been a movie, it would not have been quite as much detailed as it could have been. therefore the series are excellent in explaining the complete story.i have not read the books myself (although it had been recommended to me several times over the past few years but i never got around to it. according to other people this stays very true to its original storyline.you can expect gore and sex (elegant and not hardcore porn). sometimes i would not advise to eat anything or to have a full stomach. it is a very raw storyline about the brutality of medieval times, combined with some fantasy. however in an interview with george r. r. martin, the writer of the books he states that 'too much magic can ruin a story', and i completely agree. it is a brute, raw, painful and beautiful story to watch.this is by far the best series i have ever seen and would probably be amongst the best movies i have ever seen."

2014-05-12,othello887,Thank You Pedro Pascal,2,"to start i must say i have read all the story published so far. and i have watched every episode shown so far. in that order. usually i keep my thoughts to myself, but seeing the last season(4) in tv, i have picked up the quill to express my gratitude to the actor or the person responsible for picking up mr. pedro pascol to play the role of prince oberyn martell. superb!!! i am in awe and that role or acting is a definitive measurement for me. it just surpasses the character i had pictured in my mind by so far, that i am speechless. unexplainable. and that is in addition to already the excellent acting work (greatest of all time?), performed by peter dinklage and jack gleeson (whom i suspect everybody watching, are hating). highly recommend!"
2017-08-20,wahabyo,"Breathtaking visuals, writing, and acting. An outstanding book adaptation",5,"game of thrones has taken the world by storm in recent years and with good reason. this is not only due to the diverse talented cast but with the seemingly unconnected story lines that bring george rr martin's world of a song of ice and fire. while mostly faithful to the novels writers and showrunners david benioff and db weiss do make changes to make the show more unique and enjoyable for tv viewers. their vision and martin's attention to detail in his world building make this book to screen adaptation perfect at least in my opinion. while this show nears its end and my review may seem pointless amid the thousands already out there saying the same thing i just wanted to do my part to support this series in the few ways that i can. it definitely deserves it and it deserves your viewership too!!p.s. the first 2,3 episodes may seem dull but wait for it before long you won't be able to stop watching its as addictive as many people make it seem."

2019-09-06,orrdvir,Brilliant from start to finish,3,"one of the greatest series ever made. if you look at game of thrones as another product in hbo's line, you'll find that it practically takes everything hbo has been excelling at throughout the years and amping them to a maximum. the story george r. r. martin created is most definitely the richest most complicated story ever depicted on television, converted brilliantly to the television medium by show,runners david benioff and d. b. weiss. the production values are completely off the charts, taking less than 10% of a hollywood big-budget production per episode and giving a better result than most of those. the show also offers a huge cast with amazing performances and most of the top television directors that have been affiliated with hbo throughout the years, with a few new ones that made their breakthroughs right here.it was sad to see, by the end of the last season, how many people really watched the show because they genuinely liked it and how many ""loved"" it because that's what fashion dictated them to. it became so mainstream to hate the show's last season that everyone got carried by this unprecedented snowball effect repeating the same unbased claims and subscribing to the internet narrative that it was juts painful to experience. i'm not saying people faked their dis-excitement for the last season, but only that they allowed themselves to get too much affected by the swarm of negative buzz regarding this season, ultimately affecting how they enjoyed it and clouding their mind."

2014-02-23,richard-cripps,Some fair criticisms but still lords over so many TV shows,7,"to begin i am irritated by some of the negative reviews.unlike so many 'less,than-average' productions churned out these days game of thrones does not patronize its audience by spelling out its plot or playing grim music to identify the bad guys and the sweet whistle of bird song to glorify our heroes.i will concede the point that the sex is excessive but not always needlessly so. the scenes with lord baelish for example do set the contrast of the characters life in court with his main profession.so many of the negative reviews criticise the pace of the story and claim that it is disjointed with too many characters. indeed a 2 hour film would have to get to the point but a series has the luxury of developing the story and characters slowly and over the course of time. we are deliberately mislead to believe that rob stark's march south would give the audience the justice that the lanister's deserve. but if we carry that forward and rob had claimed victory, then when the mother of dragons inevitably reached the shores of kings landing, would it be rob stark's kingdom that she would be burning? basically the bad guys need to win for now so that we can enjoy daenerys' sacking of the south ensuring that their will be plenty of dragon fodder.more on this point, to those who lack the patients to understand the logic of the story-line. if winterfell is the most northerly town then it would surely be the first to fall in either a wildling attack of the kingdoms or the advance of the white-walkers. with the rangers withered the wilding army under mance rayder will be the first fodder that the audience cares nothing about and will hold the wall and take the brunt of the white walker attack. we now have a foe in lord brighton as warden of the north who we can happily watch die at winterfell with a sense of justice.thus the story will play out as the seven kingdoms, repressed by their kings and wars flock to the queen of dragons and her liberated slaves to raise an army to march north to reclaim civilization from the white walkers.bran, rickon and arya will rise to give us the relief from the injustices done the the noble stark family by surviving the war and they all live happily ever after."

2011-04-19,salerkbozava,This TV series is magnificent!,10,"this tv series is magnificent! i read a book and i must say that a game of thrones is one of the best books i've read. so when i first heard that hbo will do a series on the this book i was thrilled but i was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. but i must say that i was wrong and that the series is better than i thought it would be. much better! while i watched the first episode i had the same excitement as the time when i first read the book. hbo has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. sean bean was born for the role of eddard stark. costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. actors are perfect for the role they play in the series. for me the biggest surprise of the series i figure daenerys targaryen. emilia clarke actress who plays daenerys targaryen is more beautiful than i imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book. the wall is a lot different than i had imagined, but in a good way. the series revolves around eddard stark and his family. he has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. eddard stark is ruler of the north and close friend of king robert who needs his help in ruling the seven kingdoms.the seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since king robert took the throne. but nothing is ever as it seems. within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. to the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten."
2011-05-25,thethanatus,haven't been so interested in series!,9,"my vote of 8 is just beginning as i'm watching only first season in russian language. i can say i believe in future 10 of 10 to this creation! you can see a lot of human feelings like friendship, envy, hate, greed, woman psychology at queen's throne and her power!!! always respect your queens! , as they are your last and strongest wall behind you who won't let you fall! i'm always while watching movie trying to find philosophy of the author or director and all of action and high budget searchers suggest this! i'm not official voter, but i am man! man who loves his life and believes that life is amazing! wish you all learn from this series something to good!!!!! big thanks to creators of this movies and thanks all of you who have read my opinion about this movie and understood me, because understanding of written is very difficult comparing to speaking with person! have a nice watch all!"
2012-09-19,joelb123,From storyline to production an amazing product (Season 1),1,"i am a huge movies fan and when it comes to tv shows till recently i didn't follow any specific show, the first season of game of thrones was the ticket for me back to the tv arena.i will start by saying that i literally advised to most of my friends and family to view the show. were it the production, screen writing or casting i can't give a credit to only one it's the whole that made the show what it was. immediately after viewing the show i have read the entire book series and was amazed to realize that there were barely slight differences between the first book to the first season , a thing that is known to be very difficult to find.the show's storyline is thrilling and keep you on your toes from episode to episode, for anyone that loves medieval theme or/and political struggle with a bit of fantasy in it this is the perfect show.this is till the second season. people say the higher the expectation the harder the blow is, but in my opinion it wasn't the expectations that made the second season a failure (in comparison to the first one)rather a misread of the audience. i regret to say that in my opinion the team behind the show decided to sacrifice storyline to advance minor affairs between the characters. tweaking the story and the way it effects the characters - and even worse killing or even removing characters in from the books.i don't know how will they be able to fix it but while the first season is on the rating of 10 for me the second is barely reaching the 6.would recommend seeing the first season alone and read the rest - hoping for the third season to get better again."

hbo should be ashamed of putting out this garbage"
2011-07-04,shutupandletmegox3,"Never read the books, but after finishing season 1, I think I will.",10,"i am completely blown away by this series. after spending my fourth of july finishing all ten episodes (no, i am not a recluse, i was just so hooked that i found nothing else worthwhile of my time), and finding out that the next season won't be released for another year, i've been obsessively looking at posts on the discussion board in hopes of putting my impatience and restlessness at ease. seeing as that was unproductive use of my time, i decided to write this review instead so that i could at least get some final thoughts off my chest and hopefully get some sleep afterward. the beginning of episode one was a little slow, as they are with all tv series, they need to introduce characters and set the framework for the entire show, rest assured it picks up quickly. a lot of people seem to have a basis of comparison for this show, having been avid readers of the books by grrm. for the large majority of readers, they haven't been disappointed with this adaptation. to those of you who haven't read the books, coming from a non-reader herself, the show will have the same brilliant effect. yes, there are a lot of characters, but after episode 1, you slowly get the hang of it, and each episode leaves you craving for more. the acting is superb and incredibly believable, even the minor characters play their part exceptionally well. hbo has never disappointed me with their quality productions, and game of thrones is yet another masterpiece. my only hope is that it doesn't meet the same fate as rome and deadwood, because, boy would that be a shame."
2011-05-07,abstractutility,"Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly produced. Completely disappointed.",1,"i enjoy the books and am looking forward to the rest of them. i also love well done films and to some degree good television. i was looking forward to this series very much.i cannot truly see this as a new work , and having read the books, i will inevitably have to compare them... therefore, i can only praise or lament at the effectiveness of the adaptation. from this perspective, i don't think it works.the production values are pretty weak for being made nearly a decade after lotr was handled so well. i don't just mean the cg - which is pretty poor - i mean everything else as well. the music is mostly bland knock-off's of zimmer, horner, or sometimes gabriel's last temptation soundtrack. you've heard it before. even the extras are weak. i shouldn't notice this. that's a bad sign something is wrong.however it's the casting, writing and the direction which have failed. i think the show was horribly miss-cast with the exceptions of a very few characters. in a large, complicated story like this, it is necessary to get the right cast or make the adapted characters stand on their own so well that the comparisons to the original source are of limited merit.the direction and writing fail to manage this. most of the acting is wooden, and the directing didn't get the best work out of this cast for most of the time. i like sean bean - and even though his ned isn't the stone-faced man expressly depicted in the books, he manages to make it work - but needless to say, while his actions will sire many key story elements - he isn't the most important character in this story by a very long shot.indeed, of the key players in this cast, arya is one of the few that i feel can carry her dramatic weight. casting the kids would be the hardest part of this whole thing. but the adults are the most misplaced. they lack any charisma - and when it comes down to it, people who do reprehensible things need charisma to keep you interested in them. they aren't helped by the direction.there is a serious inability to portray any convincing viciousness and malice. many of the characters are ""playing at it"" and you never get the feeling they really mean it. in a series with very very few absolutely good or evil characters - where many of them must fight and kill to survive ""the game"" - this portrayal manages to rob characters who should be dangerous of any teeth. even the dire-wolves seem friendly.this seriously weakens all the characters. there is not enough tension. scenes aren't built, and each scene lacks the necessary foundation to build further tension. tension drives good stories, and good films. if you don't believe it, then you can hardly care about it. there was so much to work with, and so many difficulties that where there - i understand the difficulty in adapting a work like this. sometimes you have to cut out characters, transpose necessary actions onto other characters, shift lines and add some clarifying dialog in the name of economic storytelling. i understand why you must do this to play to the strengths of this particular form of expression.a perfect, simple example of this is the transposition of an early scene where a deserter from the night's watch is executed. rather than an old, experienced and hardened man of the watch who is so scared of the others that he flees south... they've re-written it to be an a young man who looks like he'd run from anything. there is no dramatically compelling reason for this change. it is a small example of not understanding what matters.the next scene with the dire-wolf pups, which can easily serve to illustrate the multiple intricacies of the various character's relationships is devoid of almost all dramatic effect. bran's relationship with jon snow. theon's careless cruelty. jon's (and all bastards' blatant ostracism) jon's relationship with ned. the scene is there, and it takes 4-5 minutes of screen time, but they do so very little with it... just horrid story economy.even the choice to take the black (a big deal for a major character) is stripped of any dramatic value and just plonked in there. such ham-fisted direction. it made me sick.good adaptations manage to retain the essential elements and craft a unique work which can in fact surpass the original material in some capacity.this series has failed to do so.4/10"
2013-08-07,erickcosta,"Well, I think that almost doesn't worth the popcorn...",4,"before i receive some life threats, at least read it... i'll try to be soon as possible... i read the books and i think that is an amazing material, the plot always make you want to read more to know what will happen next... but the tv version does not reflects the book, and the worst: they change the original plot with some bad ideas, like the scene where catelyn went to the tower, and finds a single blonde hair!!!! maybe this happens because each season only have 10 episodes, there's a lot of information that is not reflected in the show, and a lot of scenes that if you only watch the series without read the books, you will never know why or what the heck is happening... so my humble opinion is: read the books and forget the tv show..."

very very disheartening to see what the series became..."
2011-05-16,goran-jartin,Perfect!,10,"i know it's silly to call a tv series ""perfect"", but i find it hard to see what could have been made significantly better. sure, lena headey sometimes makes a bit too much of her crooked smile, and harry lloyd may be a bit too slimy. but these are marginal notes, a hundred times over compensated by the work of sean bean, peter dinklage and others. but the acting, of course, is only a part of it , you can find excellent acting in lots of british shows. what makes this one so special is how everything is welded together, from the basic medieval fantasy story, to machiavelli and the power play of modern politics. the scenery is gorgeous, the costume is so good you can smell the leather (and you seriously wonder if the characters ever take a bath). well, yes - i do have one major complaint. i would have preferred to watch the whole series in one go. the cliffhangers drives me crazy."
2013-11-20,mkstoten26,"Good on the whole but some scale changes, plot differences from book.",10,"enjoyable and mostly faithful version of the books with some plot changes but the characters certainly in character and looks standing up to the books except that tyrion is more repulsive physically in the books with each eye of a different color and a waddle lacking in the film. he is the kindest of the lannisters in both media and a clever strategist.the archery, approaching ships with drums and wildfire at the battle of blackwater, the undead walking past samwell tarly are excellently done. characters such as the clegane's are well realized whilst charles dance is perfect as tywin lannister. cersei, joffrey, arya and sansa are spot on.winterfell is not well served in the film. it looks a very small place with a handful of filthy townsfolk muttering in a tiny courtyard and reminding one of blackadder. the soldiers might be out and about but what has happened to the populace? this is not the mighty stronghold of eddard stark. compare king's landing's treatment , a citadel of comparable might.those like the books will find the film's portrayals of the characters appearing in their mind's eye; not a bad tribute to a film!"

2011-04-22,m-devree,Very disappointed,10,"i read the books and was very much looking forward to this show. counting the days almost!unfortunately, like some other reviewers here, i was sorely disappointed. there are a few reasons for this. the opening scene in the woods looked very good, but the rest of the show looked to me a lot less beautiful. sometimes it even looked like people were standing in front of a screen with scenery.next, the level of acting. some actors were very good, others were dreadful. just reciting lines with absolutely no feeling or emotion. but maybe that is not entirely their fault. it could be because they tried to put way too much into 1 episode. why not start with introducing one house? get to know the characters, give the viewers some feeling about who they are. this all felt very rushed, and especially if you haven't read the books, i can imagine you have no idea who is who. even after reading the books, i felt absolutely no connection to the characters.finally, the nudity.. i don't mind nudity if it is presented right and where you expect it. for example, in the series rome, i never had this problem. but here it just felt sometimes like: ""just put some naked women on the screen (or sex scenes) because that is what people like to see"". well, it didn't work for me.hopefully the next episode will be a lot better. i have to give this show another chance, because i love the books. let's all hope the next one isn't as rushed as the pilot."
2011-06-11,im_ronald_mcdonald,How can the source material turn into... This...,4,"""hbo has done it again"" seems to be the consensus on this new hbo show, an adaptation of george r.r. martin's best,selling book series, a song of ice & fire. but i've noticed a pattern. it seems to be coming from the type of people that ate the last season of lost out of the writers's hands, or found ""the walking dead"" to be the most riveting 6 hours of television they've ever seen. i've seen 8 of the 10 episodes of this season so far, and i can safely say that it's a disaster. many people say that the show is faithful to the book but they seem to be only concerned with simple plot points. character a kills character b, twist #1 leaves viewers wanting to find out what happens next, etc. but where are the details? 10 episodes, 10 hours. each episode covers 10% of the book, i.e. 7 chapters per episode. and yet the writers find a way to only scratch the surface. i'm almost convinced that they speed read through the book to get it written in time for filming.if you want a solid, well written season of television, look elsewhere. if you want a jumbled mess of amateurish editing, directing, and pacing, look no further, you found your best option. the show's main problem lies in the pacing. it is absolutely dreadful. prepare yourself for abrupt cuts to credits, clunky transitioning, misdirections due to bad writing, the list goes on. each episode is just one event after another. there is no common theme to tie anything together. the pilot races through the chapters to get to the first twist in the book and use it as a cliffhanger. the difference lies in the impact. the characters involved were only given a few minutes of screen time total. there are episodes where months pass and the writers lazily let the audience know by having people say ""it's been a month since..."" the two main locations featured are 30 days apart, yet characters come and go as if they were neighboring towns. there are several scenes that last 5-7 minutes long, and almost all of those scenes are lifeless conversations between two characters. the show would benefit greatly if everyone just stopped talking for 30 seconds. there's no time to breathe. who really cares about history lessons that date back to 500 years? the writers spend time talking about decayed skeletons just because the book did. they don't realize what should be included and excluded. there are quite a few scenes of children being taught or reminded of their history lessons by their elders. but it doesn't stop there. the genius writers have more tricks up their sleeves, including a minimum of one scene per episode involving sex and exposition. sexposition. nice to see that the writer's respect their audience. one 5 minute scene involves gratuitous soft-core porn while a character reveals his intentions and babbles on about history and names, but the moans of two women pleasuring each other drown him out. another problem is that the writers dedicate a lot of screen time characterizing secondary characters. in the book, they weren't main characters for a reason. to develop other characters. sure, they're important characters, and they do game-changing things that affect everyone, but they're a backdrop. they move the story along, and most seem one-dimensional. it's not until later in the other books that they take center stage and show their intentions, their motivations, their reasoning, etc. in the scene that i described above, the character speaking over the moans is a scheming bastard in the book. but you never know what he's up to or why. yet in the show, he has more screen time than most of the main cast. some of the characters only get mentioned a few times in the books yet here they're featured prominently, revealing things that don't get revealed until much later in the series.the show does a terrible job at portraying the world the books build. the lack of scope is jarring. seeing battles with 20 soldiers instead of 20,000 isn't exactly ""epic"" as the kids like to say. as an example, there's an army of 100,000 across the sea that the king is concerned about. but in every scene involving them marching, at the head of the group are old men and fat women. it's inexcusable. the extras (in any scene) are so bad that it's distracting. the lack of direction in this show is unbelievable. most of the action scenes are very poorly executed and feel like they came from a low budget tv sci-fi movie. they feel almost as lifeless and rehearsed as the rest of the show, so it brings nothing new or exciting. the weather is always sunny, there are almost no night scenes, no dynamic camera movement, and way too many re-used sets. the world is even more lifeless than the characters. the cities don't feel like cities but rather like sets. one particular fight scene is clearly a sound stage, with no shadows or natural lighting. the sound editing is horrendous, so don't watch with headphones. the music is mediocre, and it doesn't surprise me, seeing as how the composer was hired 6 weeks before the pilot aired.all in all, the show is just downright bad with little good. for those who haven't read the books, you might as well give the show a chance. it'll be easier to excuse some of the flaws if you don't have source material to compare it to. if you aren't looking for the next ""mad men"" or ""the wire"", then maybe you'll enjoy the show. if you have read the books, well prepare to see them get butchered."

2011-04-24,frealzor,As good as TV can get,10,"they have left some things out (direwolve pups, a few back stories) and actually added more sex or at least a little more descriptive than the books. story is pretty accurate to the book though. oh and the opening scene i don't remember the bodies in the snow being dismembered so badly (a nice addition). they may be pushing the story a little fast but they have not left out anything really crucial. those who bitch about this show should go read the book, because they wouldn't bitch if they knew what was in store for them. great start! its not always easy to accurately depict stories in books to the screen. i cant wait for the next episode tonight. *edit/update* after watching last nights episode i guess they did put the dire wolves in (musta missed it in episode 1 or something). it also made me realize that they progressed everyones age about 3 years. i guess they didn't want to show a 13 year old (daenerys) getting nailed. haha i totally agree that that was necessary for television."
2011-04-18,jschool03,"Finally, a Show that stays true to it's written roots",10,"as an avid reader, i am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. i initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. for whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. so when i saw the preview for ""game of thrones"" on hbo, i was immediately skeptical. oh, i was going to watch it, but i didn't have high expectations. i did hold a little hope because hbo is known for their high quality shows. i was absolutely shocked to watch the pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. the language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. it stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. the acting is superb and i actually felt like i was looking into winterfell for the first time. i feel like i've actually got faces to add to the characters that i've been reading about for a long time. if you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from hbo to add some spice to the series. this is not the case at all. the books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the pilot. i am very proud of hbo for producing an amazingly accurate product. i will be watching every week for sure. if you enjoyed what you saw in the pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""game of thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. i would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.update:i have now watched 3 episodes and i wanted to come back and report some more. even after 3 episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. overall the acting is still very good. i hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. i don't get this impression with this hbo adaptation. each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. i really hate watching shows in real time because i enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. but, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. a special note to viewers that have not read the books... keep watching! this series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. it may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. even after 3 episodes, i would still highly recommend this to anyone."
2011-04-18,alias-de-sired,Vast disappointment,10,"i forced myself to finish watching the pilot, and regret to say there's no way i'm gonna watch another minute of this show. okay, i admit the gore and sex scenes did induce a sudden increase of hormone in my bloodstream, but if i wanted that kind of experience, i'd go watch saw or a porno.the pace of the entire episode is way too fast. feels like they rushed thru a quarter of the first book in an hour. the storyline remains mostly loyal to the original novel, however the unnecessary altering of some details is just baffling. (with the exception of the prologue—it's nearly unrecognizable.) the others, a key element of the story, is not mentioned even once. king robert baratheon's hearty greeting to eddard stark is reduced to a simple ""you got fat."" that sure helps to depict their closer,than-brother relationship. tyrion lannister loves drinking and whoring, i don't doubt, but he's not ""always drunk"". that's robert. tyrion certainly wouldn't openly go to a brothel while his presence is required at the king's side, unless he's taken leave of his wits. and jaime's quadrupling the number of prostitutes in bed with tyrion is just...?the cast is not as strong as they would have you believe, either. cersei is too soft. lady stark speaks like a septa. viserys should be cruel and arrogant, not effeminate. and why won't the characters call each other's names when they talk? speaking of which, they can't even get the pronunciation of ""arya"" right. roy dotrice worked out everything perfectly for the audiobook in 2003! all they had to do was follow.i'm giving 1 star for the excellent photography and scenes, 1 more for the props and costumes, and a 3rd for the title sequence. to be honest, it's the only part that got me truly excited."
2011-04-18,sinisaroknic,"And so, the story begins",10,"it's very premature to say much about the series after watching only the first episode, so i'll limit my opinion to the one and only episode that has been broadcasted so far.first of all, i'm a huge fan of george r.r. martin's ""a song of ice and fire"" saga and i think that it's really a breath of fresh air that the genre needed so badly! i would hate to see this hbo series ruining all the good things that the books have brought to fantasy genre and thankfully it's not happening, at least not with the episode one.of course, almost immediately, the one that has read the book can see some differences, but they are all understandable (well, almost all of them), since no screen adaptation can follow the written work to the letter!the viewer is gradually introduced in the world of westeros just like in the book, without 20 pages/minutes of prologue and the narrator explaining all that once was, and all that is today the main characters are very decently portrayed so far and the careful viewer can, more or less, flair what relationships they have between themselves and what part will they play in the story, at least for the time, just as the writer wanted us in the beginning speaking of character relationships, there were some very good sublimations of more than a few pages of the book into just one scene, one sentence or even one screen shot! that's actually desirable in order to keep the pace of the adaptation going! the plot is developing just as it should, not too fast, not too slow and with an omnipresent touch of intrigue and mystery the production is more than fine. the costumes are good, the scenography is good and the cinematography is good. one can easily immerse in the mix of history facts (considering the gear and the lifestyle of medieval folks) and the fantasy world of ""seven kingdoms"" and the ""land across the narrow sea"" and now it's time for some spoiler alert!!! my main concern is about undead! is it a nighttime or a daytime when the dead girl comes back to ""life"" and walks the forest, only to spook the young ranger of the night's watch in the opening scene? this can mean a whole world of difference between the book and the seriesthe other is the lack of ""dreams"" and ""flashbacks"" the main characters have. those play the major role in the book (in my opinion, at least) and i only hope that the director and the producers are keeping them for the episodes to comeall the other concerns i'll keep to myself as they are a bit contradictious to the book but they aren't crucial to the storyline. at least, not as i see them right now.on the other side, the writer of the books hasn't finished the saga until now and he's participating in the making of this series, so i hope for the bestall in all, it's a good start! actually, a very good one i would say. i really prefer series that starts moderately good and develop to an excellent one than ones that start promising and then lose all of their initial appeal along the way, like ""legend of the seeker"" for example. at least, this one has an excellent foundation in r.r. martin's brilliant work.i'll give it a 10 not because it's spectacular but because i, for once, am an optimist and i really do hope that the screenplay will be able to preserve the original novels' charm. at least, for the first episode, it did"
2011-04-19,renbeaudoin,Fresh and Exciting,10,"game of thrones on hbo is a tv adaption of george r.r. martin's books, a song of ice and fire. for those fans who know and love the books, then you can't help but love the tv adaptation. it is difficult to translate books into movies or tv series, but hbo's got made it look easy. the characters, cast, scenery, costume, etc., all looked incredible, and gave me the feeling that i was inside the books themselves. although not every little detail was translated perfectly, and nor should they be, the pilot episode was a grand achievement.for all those nay,sayers out there: if you don't like the series, then you probably have never read the books or watched the countless behind the scenes trailers that helped those who didn't understand the complex storyline. yes, this story is complex, its original, its fresh, and it is very exciting. the story line gets better with each episode. you also have to keep in mind that this story is an adult story, and as i said, it is complex. simply put, hbo didn't dumb the story down, but rather remained true to the core of this epic fantasy. for those who have never read the books and found the pilot interesting, trust me it gets better and better. stick with it."
2011-04-19,sarah-r-fullerton,Definitely a keeper!,10,"having only read the books myself once, but living with a walking encyclopedia on the world of westeros, i was very, very, very excited when i heard the books would be coming to tv. hearing that they'd be done by hbo made me even happier because the story wouldn't be glossed over or sugar coated.the first episode in my opinion was definitely a good introduction to the story. you get a general feel of the characters, their back stories and their current situations. however, you're also deeply left wanting to know more about certain characters, like ned stark's sister that robert mentions, or jon snow's mother (still an on,going debate between me and my living encyclopedia).as far as the sex, violence and language go, i feel they are totally in line with hbo's standard, and in line with the book. people who complain about there being too much and compare got to rome, may i remind you of all the graphic sex scenes and nudity in that show? at least in got (so far) we have not had full frontal nudity shots, like the one received from octavia (i'm pretty sure that's in the first episode...?).i think this show has real potential and promise. people who aren't familiar with the world of westeros might have a hard time accepting some of the things in the books, like the doth'raki wedding scene, but there scenes in lord of the rings that can be hard to accept the first time round too ;) all in all, i am happy with the show, i believe it has stuck to the book much better than most book-to-tv adaptations, and wait on pins and needles for the next episode."
2011-04-20,aprthdr-33-255911,OMG! What a Fab show!,1,"i'm not a very physical women as far as violence and killing are concerned in any shape or form, but i loved the historical slant of this tv series.what i really wish is that i was one of those women being ravaged like in another review i read. i actually laughed out loud because that was exactly what i was thinking. brutally handsome men and sexy ladies...what a mixture! please continue with the style. it's fabulous! 10,10-10-10-10!oh...and the locations were great too. i looked into the site and saw that it was irelend...figures, because it's totally beautiful. great job.oh...and my boyfriend is a fan now too. i made him watch it last night and he loved seeing the beautiful women bare their bodies and the brutal be-headings and fights. of course he's a ufc fan too."
2011-04-20,ylarkirikal,Too light to watch,8,"reading the book you get into a really grim world. this did not happen in the first episode. to be honest, based on this series of book you should be able to cast a masterpiece in tv history. however, this did not happen. hopefully the following episodes shall be more grim, as is the series of books, the ages and situations portrayed in those. there should be less focus on the graphics and more on the characters and acting to display the tough emotions and situations they are going through (hint: make the actors read the books).nevertheless i am very happy that hbo is doing the series and being a fan of the books i shall be looking forward for the new episodes. thank you for bringing this on screen."
2011-04-23,kdte8581,Very fast pace but loyal to book,7,"on the whole they have done the book justice. the male characters for the most part were played well and certainly eddard was portrayed accurately. i felt that both catelyn and cersei were not portrayed in enough depth to do the characters in the books justice nor to allow them to develop as the series goes on.the story line was accurate although it did feel rushed and as if they were trying to catch everyone who has not read the book up. i did not feel that we needed to be introduced to daenerys at this point as her story only becomes central later in the books. it would have been better to allow viewers to build connections with the characters from westeros first.in light of all the review complaining about the sex or nudity in the series, i can only guess that they are not readers of the books. the use of sex and violence as means to gain and keep power are central themes in the stories and it would be difficult to portray these if they could not be depicted. it must be remembered that this was created for an adult audience and therefore will have adult content just as the book have.all in all i was far more impressed than i thought i would be as i am a fan on the books."
2011-04-24,ja4161,A Great Start,1,"to start, i must first say that george r.r. martin's books in this series, ""a song of ice and fire,"" are the best novels i've ever read. martin has a talent that most writers don't have. he's unpredictable. in a world of writers that rely on twists and needless complexity to keep the reader guessing, with few exceptions, martin treats his characters with ruthless indifference. you may never know if a character you've grown to love will survive the next page. this is not a fantasy series in the traditional sense. while there is magic in martin's books, it is generally kept to the fringes of the storyline. there is no gandolf in ""a game of thrones."" the books are largely based around intrigue and the workings of powerful families vying for power amidst a world in turmoil. there are a lot of characters in these novels, but this was never a problem as the central characters number maybe a dozen and martin creates very believable and memorable personalities. you will never confuse cersei lannister for catelyn stark, and don't dismiss this offhand for catelyn can be every bit as ruthless as cersei is. this is another of martin's gifts. he doesn't create archetype characters. jamie lannister, as you've seen at the end of the pilot episode, is a despicable human being, but later in the series, there is something very pathetic and appealing about him. tyrion, by far my favorite character in the books, is foul, underhanded, pathetic and for some reason... utterly brilliant. this brings up my first problem with the casting though.in the books, tyrion is not only a dwarf, but his visage is almost sickening. this is the driving force behind his motivations and the reason he chooses to pay for lovers. peter dinklage may be a dwarf / midget, but he's not ugly. he's just little. i was impressed by his acting ability though and have high hopes for the character.i was very impressed with the pilot episode. it stuck largely to the book, though some of the scenes differed a bit. the conversation between cersei and jamie at john arryns services did happen, but not in that setting nor in that sequence of events. the scene between cal drogo and daenerys following the marriage did not occur in this way. in the book, cal drogo was amazingly tender with daenerys and did not force her in the way that it appears in the pilot. there are a number of these minor deviations throughout the pilot, which, of course, is to be expected. my biggest complaint though is the treatment of the prologue, the ranging that takes place at the beginning of the pilot. the pilot makes it seem as if the ranging takes place mere hours after passing through the wall, yet they were around a week or two into the ranging when they come upon the dead wildlings. in addition, there is an odd deviation here in which will survives and gared dies. in the books, will actually dies at the hands of an undead waymar royce while gared escapes and ends up beheaded by ned stark. the scene was cool in the prologue, but it is so much more intense in the book. all in all though, a great start to the series. most of the characters are cast quite well and the characters are largely in keeping with martin's creations.one last point i want to make..., you probably already know that a game of thrones is set in an alternate world. a world in which summers can last for years and winters can last for decades. i've read a number of reviews that pan this as some kind of environmental message. this isn't the case. in fact, this is scientifically plausible in a world having more than one moon, which this world does have. we're lucky here on earth that our single moon keeps us in a stable orbit."
2021-02-21,haugpeter,Season 8 ruined it,10,"season 7 wasn't very good not comparable with 1 to 6. season 8 is unbelievable.
the great battle for winterfell is black in black. the scenes are very dark and it's a waste of time to sit in front of a black screen for o long time.
the story is unbelievable weak.
the end you can discuss but it's better to forget the last season."
2013-06-16,csisamos,The most epic series ever created!,1,"this show has everything! smart conversations, great story line, sex, violence, betrayal, death, magic and dragons! when i first started watching it i didn't have any idea what to expect, i was just looking for good shows to watch, but i got hooked on it from the beginning. the creator of the books is know one of my favorite writers. i just bought all 5 books and started reading them and i can say that the first season of the series is exactly the same as the first book. can't say for the others cause i haven't read them yet. i recommend that you read the books too, for they are beautifully written and and i guarantee you'll enjoy them as much as the show. it has a lot of different stories intertwining and progressing at a slow pace but delivering an interesting and unpredictable result. for example, the death of ned stark, who seemed to be the protagonist of the show at the first season, left me and the other viewers surprised. so next you would think that his first son who later became the 'king of the north' would rise and avenge his father's death, but after three long years of seeing him on the show and beginning to believe that he will succeed and win the throne, he got killed along with his wife and mother at a wedding. in each movie or series the protagonist usually doesn't die, or at least dies at the end, which makes you not actually worrying when he is in danger. in game of thrones though, you never know who's safe or not, and that's what makes it so interesting to watch! ''in game of thrones you win, or you die''"
2011-05-20,mgband,Trying to get into it...,10,"full disclosure: i have not read any of the books, and this is the first time i am experiencing this narrative.based on the high praise here on imdb, and a personal recommendation from a friend, i have given got a try. i must say that i am not overly impressed. at the end of each episode, i feel slightly disappointed, as if this show has the potential to be great, but always seems to fall short somehow. my impression after watching five episodes: got is basically a manufactured (and predictable) cliffhanger narrative based in a fantasy realm, full of unnecessary sex and violence, that seems tacked on because that is what is 'fashionable' at the moment.now i know what you are thinking. you think that i am some sort of prude or puritan or something. that could not be further from the case. i have no problem with sex or violence, no matter how explicit, if it furthers the narrative. that just does not seem to be the case here.it is not a bad show by any means. but it is also not a 9.5 show."
2011-05-11,iliastselios,Really good start,10,"i had heard how amazing the books were, but never red them. when i found out that game of thrones came out as a tv series, i was really curious to start watching it. after having seen 3 episodes, i can say that it is really interesting, and probably one of the best tv series i have seen lately. i hope to keep this opinion for the episodes coming , but till now it is way better than my expectations.the scenarios is stunning, and most of the actors really good. perhaps the only disadvantage i noticed is that some scenes are dark, and you can not make out clearly what is going on.this series is not suitable for ages lower than 13, but is a must (till now) for older people that love epic movies."
2011-05-17,samwelbeck,Nothing ever beats a book...but this is damn close so far,10,"well done writers, cast and crew. this is a brilliant adaptation of what is for me the best fantasy read i have ever had. whilst some of the negative reviews have mentioned the vast array of characters and events in only the first few episodes, i on the other hand am amazed at just how well the massive amount of characters and descriptions have managed to be so well filtered or captured for tv. this is a massive undertaking and as someone who has read the book it is very difficult to judge just how understandable the plot is thus far if you haven't. this a tale of the human trait of tribalism, loyalty and betrayal set in the magical world created by a great author where seven kingdoms lie in constant fear of the evil that winter may bring and winter is coming. to understand the plot is to move in stealth from one land to another, one clan to another, one bed to another, weaving a thread that creates the patchwork of this intricate yet barbarically woven material. what i can say, is do not worry yourself too much about understanding who, what and where each character fits in, just watch it. you will become familiar with them as the story unfolds. that said, for those who have read the books, the series has had a lot to live up to and that is its biggest test, passed so far as far as this reader/watcher is concerned. i'm hooked, again and i'm loving it. the acting is readily acceptable if not very good and whilst i was anxious about the selection, i feel so far that every actor chosen has physically fit the character described in the book very well with the possible exception of catelyn stark played by michelle fairley (who should have been a little better looking) and john snow played by kit harrington (although i can't quite put my finger on why). the detestable tyrion lannister, my favourite character, played brilliantly by peter drinklage is just perfect and as for arya stark (maisie williams), well they stole her right out of my imagination. i am writing this at episode 5 and may update it again at episode 10."
2020-05-01,ashnejaime,10 out of 10 if you stop at the end of season 6,1,"but seriously though, stop at the end of season 6. don't waste hours of your life that you can't get back on seasons 7 and 8"
2019-05-27,maria-cerase,Season 1-5 amazing. The rest is poor guesswork,4,after the book material ran out the quality of writing suffered as lot. there was still spectacle but not much character development. they should have waited for the books or gotten more involvement from grrm
2011-05-21,gorox1475,Not impressed at all...,7,"like most of you i was eager to see this new show released by hbo,the pilot started very good at least the first scene in the woods is very well made,but slowly it started too fall.after seeing all the episodes till today (last was 5th the wolf and the lion),my opinion is this :plot,nothing extraordinary or something we never seen before characters-well played a few including sean bean and peter dinklage rest it's average costumes-very disappointing except from a few soldier armours locations-the first scene was amazing almost all the scenes that where filmed outside have amazing views -but the ones they build most of them look fake and out of place -the sets are very poor they look like the average fantasy shows nothing new. story-first i will mention that i read the books,and till last episode the show follows the book with just a few lets say not really important parts left over.and now most important part and the reason i decided to make a review on the site:it all have to do with the last episode ""the wolf and the lion"" because in this episode i saw the most disgusting scene i saw in a long time. i understand people like to see nudity and sex but in the 21 century when we have internet and u know that u cant see anything on web,i don't understand why the people who made this show use it excessively here where it's really not necessary because we don't watch it for that trust me.yes in the book there are scene that lead the reader to imagine what happened between characters but it was never described in detail like in the show.and in this last episode the scene when sir loras is shaving lord renly around his nipples and under his arm (and the thing that followed...) was disgusting and it never happened in the book - yes in the book u where lead to suspect a different relationship besides friendship between this too but it was never painted like this at all.so overall an average show with a lot of bad taste nudity,some very very bad fighting and sword fighting ,even that follows the book closely the show left me with a bad taste and i probably i will pass the rest of the season.thank you"
2011-05-24,korrie42,The game is on ... don't miss it!,10,"after the first slower paced episodes this amazing series takes of. you've gotten to know the different characters and are about to set off on an amazing journey.the beautiful landscapes and wonderful sets alone are reason enough to watch. but it is the story it self that is the key. true to the books it was based on, with twists and turns at every corner make it a must see.the scripting and the actors make this story come to life and keep us glued to the television! i've always loved reading fantasy novels, but seeing a book come to live like the game of thrones makes me want more. it looks, feels and almost smells like how i've imagined it while reading.i can only say ... thank you and make more"
2019-02-08,skogsjuklo,All you need,1,"for everyone that loves sex, violence, naked men and a good story, this show is for you"
2018-09-16,bo_sfsf,Best TV series you'll ever watch !,1,best tv series you'll ever watch ! you will learn to love all characters protagonists and antagonists because all characters are amazingly acted and perfected . you wouldn't find any other actor fit to act any character the same way . the story is more than spectacular . thanks for this masterpiece :)
2011-06-01,rigityraow,Superb,9,"i thought tudors and rome were going to be almost impossible to top. camelot has been attempting to make an attempt. it passes the time.game of thrones has me wanting more each week in the same way ""the wire"" did. the multi,threaded story lines, terrific writing and acting, lord of the rings-like fantasy but remaining serious enough to get your anxiety up about what happens next.hbo - promote the person who greenlit this. you have enough story to run several seasons. including a big screen 2 or 3 part, (each part 2+ hours) movie to cover the pre-stories before game of thrones starts. let's see how the dragons were used, let's see how kahl came to be leader, let's see the battles of jamie lannister, .... hbo, you could spend the next 10 years on this story if you want.its awesome. well done!"
2011-06-28,olafur333-70-25310,Beautiful,10,"i read reviews of people complaining about f,words and porn not being needed for storytelling and f-words aren't for medieval genre's and so on and so forth. they clearly don't understand that this happens in an alternative universe where anything and everything is possible, f-words and porn, having sex with whores is an extremely important for explaining how character's are, they're attitudes and actions say everything.i watched the first episode and was very surprised, got myself the next 9 hours and watched it in 9 hours, i was left astounded. now i did not read the books, which made it very difficult for me to understand the story and plot the first viewing, i was confused some of the time and things didn't make sense to me. i made myself familiar with the characters and the history of the land of westeros, the houses and families, the second viewing of the entire season i was even more astounded. this is the type of production that makes you connect with the characters, extremely good writing this is.give yourself a look at game of thrones, with an open mind, focus and a taste for good storytelling, you will not be left disappointed. unless of course this whole type of thing simply doesn't enter your taste of genre, but then again, why are you here?"
2011-06-06,dsmartens,"Great show, surprised me, bought the books",1,"i stumbled on this show while flipping through the channels one evening, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fantasy genre show that isn't completely worthless. in fact, this show is so good i went out and bought all the books, which are extremely well written themselves. this show reminded me why i loved lord of the rings so much as a kid, and seeing sean bean's familiar face added to that effect as well. each character in this series seems exquisitely crafted, not one major character is dull or flat and keeps you constantly guessing on how things will turn out at the end of every episode. the production value of this show is very high, the acting is fantastic, and the plot is altogether enthralling. i highly recommend it even if you aren't a fantasy genre fan."
2011-06-23,apnatechnology,"First of all, I have to start out by saying that Game of Thrones will probably rank up there with LOST",1,"you've heard my thoughts on the plot elements of game of thrones' first season (and believe me, there are still thoughts to be had), but today i'm here to share my opinion on the season and why i thought it was so great.first of all, i have to start out by saying that game of thrones will probably rank up there with lost as far as game,changing genre shows go. sure, it doesn't change the field as drastically as lost did, but it's a show about dragons and sword fighting that is appealing to a mass audience. it'll be fun to watch the success of the series influence the shows that other networks put out in the future. what further influence game of thrones will have on our culture, i don't know quite yet. i'd love for it to instigate a resurgence of fantasy into the pop culture bloodstream. it has the potential to do just that, if its numbers keep going up with the second season.game of thrones might just urge on other, just as faithful adaptations of books to the small screen. shows like true blood and the walking dead follow their source material loosely, to varying degrees of success. game of thrones, on the other hand, adhered its source material (a song of ice and fire by george r.r. martin) so closely that even the pickiest fans could only gather complaints such as ""jon's dire-wolf isn't supposed to bark!"" and ""sansa and the hound are supposed to have a rapport by now!"" (yes, i admit it, i'm picky.) with neil gaiman's american gods adaptation coming down the pike at hbo, could we be seeing another such faithful adaptation in the future? it's entirely possible.the series did a masterful job at bringing us wonderful characters, through both writing and acting. peter dinklage's tyrion lannister was an obvious standout with wonderful dialog delivered with witty sarcasm or believable poignancy, whichever was required. the newcomers that the show introduced us to, from emilia clarke (pictured above) to kit harington to maisie williams, were all absolutely spectacular in their roles. the casting department chose well enough to satisfy the most dedicated fans of the source material while creating a cast that would market to the hbo television audience (sean bean was the sausage they dangled to hook fans before he was - literally - cut away).speaking of sean bean being cut away, the series also had an uncanny ability to unbalance the audience, whether with the shocking death of sansa's dire-wolf in the second episode or the more subtle scene in which a troubled ned watched as his youngest daughter learned sword fighting techniques. it wasn't a typical episode cliffhanger, but it set the tone for the rest of the series all the same. perhaps subconsciously, it prepared us for the inevitable: as written in the books, ned stark was beheaded at the end of the penultimate episode of the season, ""baelor."" fan reaction was sharply divided, as anticipated, a fact that only lends credence to the emotional power of the series (maisie williams, who portrays arya stark, made the scene heartbreakingly real). the show's inability - or refusal - to compromise with what viewers wanted as opposed to what the story demanded made it difficult to watch at times, but emotionally rewarding in the end.even the sex was difficult to watch at times, such as the scene that occurred at the end of the first episode, during the forceful consummation of the marriage between daenerys and khal drogo, or the deliberately taboo lovemaking of cersei lannister and her brother jaime. sometimes the sex could be gratuitous -- littlefinger's perfectly delivered monologue at the beginning of the episode ""you win or you die"" was set during a decidedly sleazy lesbian sex scene -- but it always seemed to stay within the show's own gratuitous, indulgent world, never going so far as to pander to the audience.the world itself was so well constructed, so brilliantly designed, that it can easily be said to be unique on television. there's no show that looks like game of thrones, and the more i watch the series, the more i'm convinced that no show should try to look like game of thrones, because any attempt would obviously fall short of the lavish and varied colors of westeros.perhaps i've gone on long enough. my opinion of the first season is painfully clear: it's my favorite new show of the year so far, and one of my favorite of all time. i couldn't possibly ask for a fantasy series more unlike anything i've ever seen. the juxtaposition of the fantasy genre with a storyline more akin to the sopranos or the wire is something i never expected to see on television, but i'm so glad it's here. season two can't come quickly enough."
2011-06-11,crazyroooster,Amazing Show,6,"this show is probably one of my favorite shows of all time. i even started reading the books and guess what! the show is almost completely identical. i don't know what people are talking about when they say it is leaving out a lot of stuff. yes, there is stuff being left out but stuff that is not really necessary to put in the show. also, a lot of people are saying this show has way too much sex and i don't know what they are talking about. you want to see a show with a lot of sex? watch spartacus. that is a show with a lot of sex and it is way more graphic.the story is amazing. it puts you on edge and always makes you wonder what is going to happen. the characters are really well written and the actors they chose for them are perfect.i just think a lot of people are uncomfortable with sex and violence. if that is the case, this show isn't for you. if you don't mind seeing some sex scenes, a few disturbing scenes(one?), fantasy, amazing character designs, and amazing cinematography then this show is perfect for you. i love it and i think it is amazingly written.i am just going to say again, this show is no where near pornography."

2014-05-07,hob_nob92,Good but hugely overrated,1,"i was recommended game of thrones by many friends quoting it to be 'the best series ever' and 'better than breaking bad'. i hoped they were right and marathoned the first 2 seasons, i always found myself waiting for something to happen but it never came, only at the very end of the second series did i find myself being remotely interested in the proceedings. now after just finishing season 3 i have changed my outlook slightly, season 3 is infinitely better than 1 & 2, this isn't to say it is now brilliant it's just not as awful as before. season 3 still has it's flaws in the seemingly endless trials of bran and sam. four characters make the third season passable, daenerys targaryen's story of her and her dragons is brilliant, the hound and arya's story line is good, but the best character in season 3 is ramsay snow played by iwan rheon his psychotic and creepy personality is genius. i find myself only becoming interested when any of these combinations of characters are on screen, all others with exception of tyrion bore me.i believe that got is a good series but is way overrated by many people, too hyped up and above all else a bit boring."
2019-05-24,irishmtnclimber,Crap,9,i hate this show! double thumbs down. made for fantasy special losers that can't get a date to save their life. switch the channel to the sopranos or narcos if you want to actually see a good series...
2011-07-03,jamestmoody,Awesome!,1,this series will hook you in by the end of the first episode. i didn't read the books prior to watching the series but i have finished the 1st novel now and love it! i have enjoyed this series more than any series hbo has done since the sopranos and rome. hbo did a great job of transferring the viewer in to the seven kingdoms. it appears that the writers for the series took every 80 pages of the novel and used them to each episode. very true the books and may be the best series adaptation ever done. it is truly my hope that hbo continues this series in the same manner. if they continue to stay true to the novel and use 70 to 90 pages as an episode i will not miss an episode. thanks again hbo!
2011-07-05,sam6566,Absolutely riveting!,1,"this series has got to be by far the best i've seen to,date. the authenticity of characters and places was stunning. i wasn't expecting much when it first aired, but then i was hooked. 2012 is too long to wait for the next season! brilliant cast, excellent acting, great direction. loved sean bean in the role of ned stark as the king's hand. lena headey has come a long way from the ""sarah connor chronicles""! peter dinklage as tyrion lannister was outstanding and immensely enjoyable to watch. the integrity of every cast member's role was maintained to the finish of the season. can't wait to see what happens next. have half a mind to get and read the entire series of a song of ice and fire."
2011-07-05,nounou_,Awful series,8,"awful, awful, awful. firstly, the story takes a millennia to get going and after 3 episodes i was bored with the lack of solid storyline. i also became tired of the gratuitous foul language and sex scenes which for a fantasy drama were totally unnecessary, over the top and always in bad taste.i haven't read the books and i'm not likely to now. it seems like either the author or the screenplay writer have a penchant to show as much female flesh as possible, portray women as mere sex objects and degrade females as much as possible by addressing them with slang and offensive names for female genitalia.this series needs to go in the bin. absolute rubbish."
2011-07-07,trustma,"Top 6 Reasons to Watch ""Game of Thrones""!",8,"i too have eagerly been awaiting this show, hoping against hope that it would actually be good. i'd rather shove razors into my eyeballs that watch disappointments like legend of the seeker, robin hood, or any other pile of recent hollywood ""glop"" that is passing itself off as fantasy fiction tv these days. luckily, game of thrones lives up to its hype and, in my humble opinion, may actually change the way fantasy television is made from now on.reviewers in this thread have already provided the basic outlines of the story, so i am not going to bother with that. what i will do is provide the top six reasons to watch this amazing series:1. it has child actors...and usually i avoid shows with child actors like the plague. they irk me. but maisie williams (arya stark) and isaac hempstead wright (bran stark) actually give two of the best performances in the series. they aren't the type of child,actors that you feel like giving a good smack to. 2. it is dirty! that's right. not everyone wanders around with modern hair-dos from rodeo drive, and never gets dusty. people are costumed and adorned as they would have been in medieval times. does lady stark put on a fancy new dress when the king comes to town? no! do the villagers all have perfectly-laundered and pressed garments? no! are the castles and palaces all sparkling clean? heck no! this really just adds to the realism of the whole series.3. peter dinklage. even if the character of tyrion lanister had been a regular-sized man, this performance would still be emmy-worthy. after a while, you begin to forget that tyrion is a dwarf, until he reminds another character of it in the story. he is the perfect, drunken fool with a brain born for stratagem. 4. the opening sequence: the theme song is one of those tunes that will get stuck in your head for days. that's a bit annoying, but having the clockwork map in the opening sets up everything beautifully. a viewer gets an idea of the scope and world of the series.5. the sex: some people have been whining about it. well, this show was never meant for mormons (no offense to mormons...i watch big love too). often shows have these boring, long, speeches of people explaining things. they go on and on and are necessary, but dull as ditchwater. what game of thrones does, is allows characters to give these endless expositions that viewers need to hear to understand the story, while also throwing in a bit of raunchiness. it works! no longer boring. 6. lena headey: i bet everyone thought i was going to mention the performance of sean bean. yes, he is perfect for his role. but i think ms. headey really shines as queen cersei. she's definitely the villain...yet you can't help but like her a bit. she has this amazing smirk too that almost looks like she is about the laugh and cry at the same time. you can see there's always a lot going on in her head, but can never tell what that she's actually thinking. where do her actual loyalties lay? it's a mystery...and that makes her character even that much more intriguing. so, those are enough reasons for now. there are countless more. watch the show. and if you don't like it? well, you're either dead inside or simply dead."
2019-05-15,v-xristina,Thank you,7,"thank you very much for all those years of entertainment. i know that your only enemy in 8th and last season was time... not enough time to wrap characters and situations up and reach the high expectations of your audience . that's probably one reason for people rating this season so low . i thank all the actors writers producers and the whole got crew that sacrificed a lot to have this awesome result in such a short time . i wish emilia clarke good health and hope she overcomes her aunerism problems , and no more panic attacks for the producers! you did your best and thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing this world with us for 8 years . we will always remember ! one more episode left and i'm sure it will be brilliant! so long !"
2012-08-31,kaveh-gholizadegan,One of the best but not even close to the original books,10,"i'm sure this is one of the best tv series ever! every thing is good and even close to the perfection, but the thing is that it is not even close to the original books! i'm just finished the first part of the book three an i love it! although i rate this tv series 9/10 (i think it is even deserve 10/10) but unfortunately it is not good as the books! i think if this serial was made more like the original book, it could have became even much better! these casts and this story, have more potential than this and i believe they can do even greater than this! i like this tv series but in compare to the george r.r. martin's books it is nothing! as i said i gave 9/10 ( even 10/10) to this tv series but when i compare it with the book,it is 4/10!! i really suggest to anyone whom can read the book, to read it! it is really something different! it's really magnificent!"
2011-07-23,jebowser,GoH - True to the Last Minute,8,"after hearing a lot of hype involved with this recent new series that hbo released, i decided to check it out for myself. having read the first two books in the series (game of thrones and a clash of kings), i was curious as to how true to the ""feel"" of the first book would transpose to ten 50,55 minute blocks. like previous reviewers have noted, most attempts at visually bringing a book to life are usually met with dire results or fail to live up to expectations for the whole season. however, i can say with absolute certainty that this series has lived up to that hype and more.everything from the casting to the dialogue and non-verbal imagery to the set designs are spot-on to how martin described each environment in his book. sean bean, lena headyey, emilia clarke, and peter dinklage, among the other fine actors, do a superb job of making their characters their own, especially dinklage's portrayal of tyrion (my favorite character of the book series so far). the environments capture the air of tense conflict as the story unfolds in each episode, and the dialogue, although not always delivered well with some of the characters, was refreshing to hear overall. it was nice to see each actor take their respective roles very seriously.some folks would complain about the amount of nudity, sexuality, and gore seen throughout the series. i respond by simply saying that they perhaps toned it down a bit from much of what is described in the books and that those folks should be grateful that they aren't visually representing the book in this fashion to the word. still, this is a series for mature audiences and if sex, gratuitous violence, and bloodshed aren't your cup of tea, i would stay away from this series, both on hbo and in the books.overall, this is a great adaptation to george r. r. martin's first book in his epic series and i cannot wait to see what they do for the next season's adventure ""a clash of kings."""

2011-08-09,aidan-120-325199,Just magnificent,9,"after watching the spartacus : gods of the arena series i saw this was advertised. immediately attracted to the scene of sean bean (eddard stark) wielding a huge clay,more i knew i had to watch it. at first i called it ""the lord of the rings, but different"" only because of ned stark's striking resemblance to sean bean's other famous role boromir. however after a mere few minutes into watching the series i realised this was in it's entirely different world.as the characters progressed and loved and hated each other each episode i was even more drawn in. upon watching the series a second time i loved it only more.the saga leaves us with an epic cliffhanger in the series' penultimate episode and in the final episode, which i will obviously not disclose here but, it left me in awe and i could not wait for the next episode/season. when the series finished i could not wait for the next season so began watching again, as well as purchasing all the books.i have never been so in love with something i have so many hates for. i do not consider these flaws but only interesting and new writing styles. it makes it more realistic the way you are screaming at the screen going ""why did you do that?!"" and etc. hating and loving some characters and plot devices is exactly what the writers wanted me to do.this is one of the best television series i have ever seen. probably the best. if i were a producer i would be throwing my money at this to make more and more. i would even pay off george martin to write more books just so i am entertained for the next 40 years. this combines love, hate, gore, sex, evil, good, and adventure perfectly into a fine mix which should be savoured. truly i hope i haven't bigged it up to much. however it is incredible"

2011-08-30,cloudboards,Mr Martin's work of genius,10,"after personally reading each book, the game of thrones series was incredulously close to the works written of in the books.the author is an incredibly talented writer and the dramatisation regards the stories told with the precision of a sniper. screenplay adaptations are very hard to make, especially those done properly and the only other fantasy work of art that has been produced correctly, in my opinion was 'the lord of the rings'. 'martin's books evoke a powerful image within the reader's mind about the transcending story and the screen play adaptation was true to the novel's idea's and story. great praise to all cast and crew especially mr benioff and mr weiss for the work of art on,screen. special thanks to peter dinklage who added a brilliantly comic performance to his own role.definitely dying to watch the next series unfold."

'an hbo production', this had to be interesting, i thought. with series such as entourage, the sopranos and sex and the city setting the bar pretty high, the expectations from the first episode were already built up.the show starts off with men hunting. the setting develops an eerie sensation as the audience realizes that it is the dead that it being hunted. the dead, in the show aren't glamorized vampires or werewolves but monsters of some sort. at this point you think to yourself, 'umm... fantasy for adults?...hmm'. this apprehension however, disappears within minutes of the sequences following it.game of thrones, is a show like nothing before. the underlining theme of fantasy is so realistically portrayed that the story, unimaginable in today's day and age somehow still seems plausible in another time. the complexity of the characters is so simply executed, peeling back one layer at a time that it becomes impossible to pick a favorite. even the queen, involved in harming a 10 year old to the extent of paralysis, can be sympathized for when the antics of her disloyal husband are revealed. the show touches upon every taboo that may exist in today's society. providing, what i feel is a sense of, liberation! the violence, the sex, the greed, the manipulation and even the hint of love are all ingredients in a very entertaining drama series.there however, do exist some censorship issues. the nudity of women for instance, crosses the line of indecency. a scene featuring a 10 year old boy drinking his mother's breast milk is a little more than unsettling. putting the television show aside and thinking of the child actor at the present moment, is it really necessary to expose a child to such things at such a tender age? breast feeding an infant is appropriate to ensure healthy development but for a 10,year old boy? it almost borders on pornography, especially since kids are growing up much faster now.game of thrones is brutal, hard hitting and shocking. but it isn't uncommon to get so engrossed by the characters and their lives that censorship issues no longer matter. it is a thoroughly enjoyable tv series which is very well executed making every part of the show vital for its success. the creators have left very little room for improvement doing a fantastic job at every step of the way. hbo, once again lives up to expectation."
2016-06-29,otomitas,Lots of talk and no action!,6,"i will get straight to the point. great story but lacking action. the scenes, costumes and music is great. this has lots of talk and talk, but very little action which is quite disappointing. just like it says adventure/drama/fantasy is the genre which they are right about. they know how to hype you for the next episode with there tactics, and once you you will see the following episode you will be quite disappointed as you will only see them talking and again no action. i have found this quite boring. if there would be more action, great fights as we all would love to see, especially the dragon ones then this would get 10/10. if you don't like violence and like to see people talk then this is definitely for you and you will love this."
2019-04-27,ehsan-exe,Why we can't rate this 20 stars !?,4,this show deserver more than 10 stars.lovely actors and actresses lovely story.
2019-12-24,johndunnemoone,10/10 until the last season,10,big fan all the way through although found it quite cliche at times it always did enough eventually to renew my interest. devastated it finished out the way it did could of been so much more!
2014-01-14,josvangastel,One of the best TV series ever !!,10,"this series got it all, every episode you don't know what's going to happen. the acting is great the visuals are outstanding and more. you hate ore you love a char. somethimes you hate one at first and then it turns that's a great experience. you never get borred because thare a lot of plots and a lot of char. and every year you got a new char. the fights and the sneaky plots i love the most but every one can see that it's much more than only that. i hope they can keep me surprise every time with something that happens wat you don't expect. i hope they can keep it up. i read the books and it's really interesting to see wat the differends are with the books and the tv series. there are a few things differend but it doesn't bother my (normely it does). if you are twisting and turning to watch this show i you don't know yet i just say watch a few episodes and you will be hooked on this one. that's why i think this tv series is one of the best maby the best tv series ever !!! can't wait for more of these tv series."
2012-04-26,ans_79,Excellent drama-fantasy,1,"i enjoyed the series a lot and got interested enough to read the books. the series depict intrigues and drama, mostly accurately following the books story line. of course some minor characters and events are left out since it is impossible to show on the screen all the broad scope of the books. people who say the show is not moving forward obviously didn't read the books (about 1000 pages each). the acting is good on the most part , especially peter dinklage who is brilliant as tyrion, and sean bean. other well-played characters are catelyn stark, littlefinger, bronn, pycelle, varys, hound, theon and daenarys. joffrey is very annoying as he is smiling all the time, and his facial expressions don't match his cruelty.some casting problems - the actor who is playing robb has frozen expression, and a very thick accent. brienne is not ugly enough. she should be ugly as in the book, because this is one of her motives to be a warrior. asha greyjoy is supposed to be sexy and attractive - the actress is not. margaery should be younger. there is too much sex and gay sex - some scenes were invented and never appeared in the books: the lesbian scene in the brothel, margaery and renly on their wedding night, renly and loras, joffrey and the whores. i don't think that people watch this show for the sex and nudity, so why to throw in even more than necessary by the plot. overall - great entertainment despite some shortcomings. i hope there will be third and forth seasons."
2011-11-12,slagpurebreed,Series,10,"yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.^^the series follows the books very closely, so its no surprise that the movie seems ""gloomy"" as the books have been given reviews along this same path. there are a few sections that drag, like any book, but for the most part it moves pretty fast, and beware, martin has zero allegiance to his character, hint, hint, and the last episode is proving of that. again, the story follows the books well, i guess this explains why we martin book readers were pulling our hair out waiting for the next book, because he is helping make the dang thing...er...i fear the next book is going to be just as painfully long away in making!"
2011-11-13,forallmydamnjunkmail,Amazing.,7,"this is the first time i have watched something cinematic, and been so blown away that i had to read the books. first time. evar.normally you read the books, and then you watch the movie and you're so disappointed, right? not this time.i watched the series and was amazed. i went out and bought all the books immediately, and finished them in a couple of weeks. all 5 books.basically, the series entails struggles between the bourgeoisie of the kingdom of westeros. it's a relatively new country (notice how i said relative?) and the story mainly focuses on the family of starks. there is an overarching battle brewing, involving strange creatures from the north. however, the threats are frustratingly ignored due to all the tensions within the kingdom.the story is realistic, and gives the each of the characters astounding depth. it has twists and turns that literally make you gasp and flip out. there is sex and gore, and to be honest, i like the sex and gore. the show has enough that it makes it realistic. in fact, it's the most realistic killings that i've seen. ever. if you stab a guy through his jugular with a lance, yes blood is going to come spurting out. yes, it's in medieval times. people have sex for kicks, and there are prostitutes. deal with it. the best part is that the show had just the right amount of it, without using it as a crutch. the characters are portrayed so beautifully. that's the only thing i can really say. basically, you'll love it.and this is coming from a teenage girl who does not even look like she reads fantasy, much less watches it, or talks about it."
2011-11-30,inai,Too much violence and gore scenes...blood all over the brainless characters,10,"i was very surprised to see that in the low,rating reviews people often complained about the multitude of sex scenes, but nobody about the sequences that show explicit acts of murder, violence, aggression, rapes, animal cruelty... i agree, there is too much sex and naked women, but hey, are we already so desensitized as human beings, that those disgusting scenes are not a problem? my stomach is still confused. i had to cover my eyes at every 2 scenes. if children grow with this kind of evening movies it is just wrong. also, the characters were developed superficially, in a poor manner. they were childishly divided between extremely good and extremely evil. if the movie is very accurate and realistic, why these non-realistic people? my two stars go for the costumes and settings."
2014-07-21,rodrigues-gabriel0002,I saw one episode and could not resist to see the other 39!,10,"to date, the game of thrones series was the one that set me three days ""followed"" watching television... watching the episode ""winter is coming"" (1 episode of 1 season), i was ""in love"" and just stopped until the episode ""mhysa"" (last episode of season 3). then i started following the 4th season of ""two swords"" to the ""children"". it is also the first series i think it was done in a better way than the book itself. there are people who call the game of thrones 'harry potter for adults', but i do not agree with these people, because the two have no comparison possible, because they are both top of the tops. what impresses and stands out in the series is: the vast existing coordination, as it must be very difficult to write in so many places and with so many actors; landscapes and sites chosen are very nice to look at; visual effects (vfx) that have bestial quality and the clothes, but the clothes are what viewers less repair, but have small details that give the epic style to the acclaimed hbo series."
2011-12-26,dkeroma,"Unnecessary violence, nudity and slow plot",1,"watched up to ep5 the nudity and violence in this series is unnecessary. 9.5/10 sex scenes depict soulless sex or ""f...king whores"" as they would call it as opposed to sex between people who care for each other. imo it glorifies having sex with as many women as possible as women are disposable and plenty for a price. continuously referring to women as ""whores"" and the amount of times a brothel house crops up is unnecessary as well. i feel like this show is catering for heartless and violent men or glorifying those who are and depicting them as men of honor.there are a few scenes where someone's head has been chopped off with blood spurting/rolling around which is tasteless and serves no purpose. the lord of the rings' battle scenes don't even portray this level of violence gore.the plot is slow to develop and the only exciting things that happen are in the last few minutes of the show where they place a cliff hanger of some sort. watching a whole ep for those few minutes isn't worth it at all. more events unfold in jersey shore's 40m than 3hrs of this."
2019-08-03,ad-236-84262,A word of advice,10,"just finished season 8. an advice to the writers and scenarists: stay of the coke and don't drink so much. perhaps it will improve your work.
never seen a more abominable scenario. a man gets stabbed in the guts twice wit a dagger that goes in till the hilt and then walks a mile or so and is still heathy enough to speak a dialogue?? cynical and ironical tyrion turns into a weeping dweep?? a dragon , well i don't know about dragons - but spouting fire endlessly?? destroying a city when you only have to take apart the main building to get your enemy?? and so on and so on..
stay off the booze boys an stick to writing commercials!!"
2012-03-13,henkvandam19,Beginners mistakes,1,"my encounter with this series was very brief. after watching 6 minutes of first episode i had already enough. actors crawling, walking and even running in obvious plastic snow or whatever material was already a pain to watch. and even as they walked and ran you see no vapor from their breaths whatsoever. if you start a series in this way when you should really get the audience attention and you make such ""mistakes"" i don't wanna see it. maybe my bad but in 2011 this kind of mistakes can be easily be overcome. i see it as an insult to the audience what could have been a good series.furthermore, the part of the dialog i saw was also rather poor and did not appeal to me at all."
2011-12-27,papakyri-249-312255,Nothing special at all.,10,"i saw the 1st season. very very boring. i think i have wasted 10 hours of my life, for nothing, by watching this series. the first episode was a bit promising, but later on nothing. so i saw the rest of the 1st season hoping for some improvement, which never ""came"". the script and the plot is nothing special and very very slow. casting is also poor except, sean bean and peter dinklage. the production gave me the impression of a low budget film. too much blood, without any war scenes. too many sex scenes probably too boost up the ratings. compared to the pilars of the earth (8 mini tv series), the game of thrones is at least 3 ""steps"" lower. i really do not understand the imdb high score of 9.4, no way ! there is no point for me to wait for season 2."
2019-05-24,eshipman13,don't waste your time,2,it's a longer lord of the rings. the nudity and gore is cool but it's not worth a month or your life.
2021-07-06,drod623,Seasons 1-7 10 stars best show on tv season 8 not so much,10,"season 8. overall rating 4. didn't ruin show but very close. episode 6 made zero sense. episodes 1,5drew outline of the story that made sense. just no detail to tie it all together. episode 6 was a ""s"" show no organization story didn't make any sense. void of all logic.redo season 8!"
2013-06-26,loldude12,watch this show,10,"this is one of the if not the best show i have ever seen. it has tits, blood and dragons sadly every season is just 10 episodes. they are 1 hour long though. the visuals are amazing and the series is easily downloadable (i didn't download it of course). one advise i should give is that you should not search the web for game of thrones. or the comment section on youtube. it is filled with spoilers. the series is based upon a series of books. the people that read these book are giant assholes because they will spoil every thing before it even happened in the series.with that said. go watch the show! if you haven't yet. you do not know what you are missing out on. ~loldude12"

2013-07-15,thekevman,"Swords & Dragons & Castles, oh my!",7,"i'll keep this review short because i doubt there's anything i can say that hasn't already been said. basically, i was drawn to this series because it appeared to be a cable tv version of 3/4ths of the video games i play (skyrim, dragon age, etc) and i have to say, i wasn't disappointed. i watched all of the first 3 seasons within a weeks period of time on demand, and it seems that each season only got better. at first i was daunted by the number of characters and locations, but it really didn't take long to get to know the people... at least the important players. the characters have real depth, and it's hard to completely hate or completely love any of them, because most of them have good and bad traits, just as we all do in real life. i recommend this to anyone who is into fantasy stories or rpg video games!"
2019-05-30,brecovece,"Shame, shame, shame, shame",10,this tv series managed to destroy all good which was there before last season. shame
2012-04-29,joewho66,"I admit, I hadn't read ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"" before watching the first episode. I was worried the books would ruin my enjoyment of watching the show. I was wrong.",10,"i watched the trailers for months, being a fan of sword and sorcery fantasy i was looking forward to this new series. i wasn't disappointed. by the last episode i had made up my mind to read the books. i was amazed to see how close the producers stayed to martins writing. the actors really felt their parts. peter dinklage, michelle fairly emilia clarke are all stand outs, not to mention all the stark children. the dialog was almost word for word. from page to screen, martins prose brought to life, almost exactly like he wrote it. it wasn't really till my second viewing that i really fell in love with game of thrones. although, i must be honest i missed a lot of the details they left out. things like daenerys being dressed before her meeting kal drogo, being told that the kal is so rich even his slaves wear golden collars. then, her hand maid puts a golden choker around her neck. daenerys' and bran's dreams, and the flashbacks to the rebellion that won robert baratheon the iron throne just to name a few. i understand sometime its necessary to omit certain things when making an adaptation, but it would have been so easy to include most of this things, but i digress. now the second season has begun. having now read the first 4 books i can only hope they can keep true to the very complex narrative. so far its only 4 episodes in, and even though they have already advanced the pacing of several story lines and changed many details such as tywin lanister being the ruling lord at harrenhal instead of roose bolton, i still find the show a very enjoyable watch. i have read online that hbo has included things from book 3 in season 2. i can only pray they did not have to remove plot lines for book 2 to cram in whatever bits they took from book 3."

2012-07-29,spunionring,Poorly Made and Boring,8,"this show is very bad, hard to even sit through the first episode.1) i am a bit surprised that if you organize the reviews here to show the bad reviews first, that universally the only complaint is the excessive sex. the sex is excessive... but that's hardly what makes this show terrible. but while i'm on the topic let me second the previous assertions, there is too much sex, its way too graphic, and its portrayed in a way that is derogatory to women.2) now that we've got the sex complaints out of the way, the show itself. the sets and props are just terrible. glaring issues such as lord eddard's ""leather"" vest is stitched too perfectly, in pristine condition and clearly has never been worn before. when jon snow saddles a horse, he carries a large and perfectly manufactured saddle. the barbarian chief is supposed to be a tough, rough barbarian, and yet his body is too soft skinned with a tan that is obviously earned in a tanning bed, and why do you specifically mention his hair is supposed to be braided, and then never braid it but only bother to give him 3 or 4 ponytail holders? oh and of course danaerys who is supposed to have white hair just looks terrible with her dye job. maybe someone who was a platinum blonde could have pulled it off better? because getting a brunette to play her and just dying her hair is painfully obvious. these issues and issues like them distract from the believability of the show, and these things don't even require fancy special effects!3) the actors are dry and and give weak performances. its hard to say whether its the fault of the actors or the director... but in the end you just never end up getting invested in the characters as anything just cheap 2dimensional stereotypes. you want to think that *maybe* they just didn't have enough time to develop each character, when they have so many characters to cover... but then you wonder why you have them waste so much of each episode staring blankly at the screen as if that creates emphasis or is dramatic or something.. it doesn't.4) the final point i have to make is in regards to the fact (i assume) that the reason this series is so popular is because of fans of the books. i read the books, and while the general plot, and most of the scenes are taken from the books, there are enough variations to bug you. i guess lord eddard is ok, he's a great actor, and lady cat is pretty well cast for her character, bran and arya and sansa are good too, appearance,wise... but jon snow just doesn't strike me as the tough and clever guy he should be, and robb doesn't seem nearly regal enough. king robert was too soft looking for someone who still fights in tournaments and leads hunts, and his beard is not nearly burly enough. jorah mormont isn't old enough. oh and the dwarf, tyrion is supposed to be deformed, with dark hair streaked with blonde, mismatched eyes, and a protruding forehead and nose; but they just got a blonde little person to play him and left it at that. i could go on and on, but basically if you read the books then none of these characters in the show are going to sit well with the characters you read about. they also change small parts of certain scenes, which seems minor, but completely changes the nature of certain characters. for example, when danaerys gets married to khal drogo, they almost play the scene exactly like the book... but then they basically just have him force himself on her and move on, where in the book he is patient waiting for her to accept his advances. this totally changes the nature of their relationship in my opinion, where in the books he earns her trust and respect, but in the show he's basically just bought a woman sex-toy and that's that."
2019-05-21,wsh0927,It was epic then failed so hard,6,"game of thrones has been the biggest tv series in past decade. it became so popular that people from all over the globe watched it. the music, characters, plots, cinematic scenes, dialogue, almost everything was perfect in the beginning when the show was able to use a lot of sources from the novel ""the song of ice and fire"".
the descend of quality started to appear when the show caught up to the novel's story line. there were noticeable character's out of behavior actions and there were plots that were not so well written. characters' dialogue became duller and inconsistent and questionable plots occurred before season 8. even though these setbacks in quality especially in characters' dialogue and story telling and there were unconvincing plots, when the producers announced that the season 8 will take 2 years to complete, the fans accepted the waiting because we all wanted to enjoy the show so much.
then season 8 came out and it had plot holes and unbelievably bad story telling. i have nothing to complain about its music, acting, cinematic scenes, and cgi (i really don't care about the coffee cup) however the only but the biggest problem with the got is that it failed in story telling. the producers destroyed characters personalities and their own individual story. in the end, it made the whole 8 seasons of got irrelevant.
d&d probably thought got became so popular because of the fantasy and dragons and cgi's. no! we loved the show because each character lived in the settings of westeros and some of their actions resulted in ultimate consequence. but d&d's misdirection of efforts and the lack of quality in developing a good story line killed their own legacy."
2012-02-11,sameersn2902,amazing medieval fantasy and well written and directed.......HBO is great,10,"this is the most amazing tv series i have ever seen in my life. its greatly written and well directed. thanks to george martin who is so good in taking us to the world of fantasy land. the characters in this show is so rich and each one has its own story. right from 8000 yrs ago in westeores before the wall to aegons landing and after 300 yrs later how robert rebellion broke out and 17 yrs later how game of thrones events happen and the king rode to north to ask for his best friends help to look after his kingdom. most of the tv shows are very slow in stories but this one have good pace and twist in every episode. i loved the way the george martin created all seven kingdoms, the major houses and minor ,their culture, their sigil,the family tree their appearances such as traits like their looks,hair, eyes and their words. and mainly wall of north and what lies beyond.also they have shown nice scenic landscapes and scenic beauty of the nature and did great job to show how westeroes look like. i m also very excited about the seasons the way it happens in westeroes and the winter with long night. it takes best directors and filmmakers to understand this book and transform it into great entertainment and truly they lived it upto the standards. also the music track is such overwhelming and deep. right from best opening sequence which takes to different part of westeroes and neighbor continent with moving veiw map representation with such powerful electrifying soundtrack.when u see game of thrones u must have some of the knowledge about book song of ice and fire and should know about some past history and events then u will enjoy this shows a lot. this show is not just about blood, violence and swords. but about understanding each and every character and their importance.u will love each and every scene of the every episode and duologue's and conversation and will get drawn in each and every character.i just culdnt hold myself to watch the next season of the game of thrones even though i read the book."
2019-05-20,armin-kharazi,Lost for words,10,"truly heartbroken by what has become of this once masterpiece, we did not deserve this."
2013-08-04,tyler_shepard,One of the greatest shows of all time,9,"game of thrones is based on the novels a song of ice and fire, a fantasy series by american author george r. r. martin. the series contains five books so far, two more will follow. the plot takes place in the mythical continent of westeros, which is comparable with the european medieval. there are several powerful families or houses which are permanently fighting for the ""iron throne"" of westeros. game of thrones combines epic adventures like in the lord of the rings with political intrigues and interpersonal issues like in the sopranos.the actors are well chosen, most of them fulfill the image i personally had in mind when they were described in the books (unless they changed the outer appearance of some characters on purpose , for example one character has blue hair and a blue full beard in the novels, in the show the kept his outer appearance more usual). there is a huge amount of characters introduced, for non-readers the overview can be difficult to keep; that's why you always should pay attention, especially when new characters are being presented. the huge amount of characters does not lead to a chaos without any system, it all makes sense if you keep an overview.season 1 keeps as close to the novel as possible, when you read the book not long ago, you will even recall specific dialogues. in seasons 2 & 3, the hbo directors digress from the novels very slightly, but don't worry - the changes they made aren't really important, it's often just budget-forced; sometimes characters are left out or two characters occur as one.when you hear about the show, many people say it's just about sex and killing one main character after another. don't listen to this! well, there is a lot of sex, but that's not what it's about. game of thrones shows how the european medieval could really have been - dirty, treacherous, dishonorable and inequitable. the point of killing main characters is true; george r. r. martin is ruthless and does not care how beloved his characters are - when they need to die, they die. that doesn't mean, any death of a character is random, even if it seems this way at first. when the story goes on you will realize that every death has its purpose for the plot.a major point that makes game of thrones one of the best books/shows in the past decades is the actualization of good and evil. there are only a few characters who are clearly considered as ""the good ones"" and even less, barely a handful of ""evil ones"". every character has his own goals and achievements he wants to reach, just as ways to realize them. it's up to you if you support one specific character or not. there are many plot lines with different characters, some of them you will learn to love and some of them you will learn to hate.if you enjoy the fantasy genres in general and are looking for a show full of tension, exciting plot twists and with an absorbing, really huge plot, then game of thrones is a must see!"
2016-07-31,alexalleruzzo,This Is The Final Season,6,"hbo... oh, hbo, going with the 'limited series'"" to maximize profit. they have bailed on some really promising shows, which leads me to believe that their cheaper offerings of 'now', and 'go' have bitten them in the ass! i feel the password-sharing era shall come to a close very soon. (ala netflix). these 'higher-ups' have crazy visions/observations of where shows should go based on their tastes at any given moment. and there are obviously money issues going on, which leads me to believe that these 'limited series' deals will lessen their accountability in those upper-echelon positions. eh, capitalism... winter is here for major cable."

2019-05-19,harshpatel0703,Worst Finale Ever,6,never seen such a bad finale for any major season. no build up about anything just doing it for the sake of doing.
2019-05-20,helmi_nsir,Another perspective for the final season and the series at once,10,"so at first let us set the record straight ! normally we can't judge a series season based on separate episodes even more when it is a final season. therefore it can't be reasonable rushing out giving judgments. and sometimes even after finishing a movie or a series it takes time to make up your mind about it. don't get me wrong am not trying to give lessons here on how to rate a show, after all; this is a matter of opinions and affections based on various backgrounds many of them are subjective ! keep in mind that most of high ranked series when it comes to the final season it gets turned away by the wide audience. in most cases this judgement is purely sentimental ! beside getting over,hyped, closures are hardly accepted by the majority. but what bothers the most is the black and white duality in human thinking and that's beyond just a tv show criticism.. now before me here getting into details concerning my opinion which gonna be objective for two reasons, one is i never read the books and i don't open my ears to theories. this is a choice i've made for every book-based series so not to get oriented to other directions and to keep the track of the story lines and the dramatic plot of the show itself. as it is known there is a big difference between a book and a series and they can't be related otherwise you gonna get false thoughts and assumptions, and eventually disappointed.
the second reason proving my objectivity is that i followed up the show periodically since it first aired in 2011. which means that i'm not riding on the wave of its success ! with that being said you should know that i have nothing against those who follow the trend that's 100% legit but be careful not to make prejudgments and get driven by others reviews.
after trying to understand the common arguments of those who found themselves failed by this season i believe that i came across two categories those who were expecting more from one character or another and didn't appreciate the role they played or the ending they faced, and those who had an issue with the plot and the story orientation itself.
for the first category it reflects a conviction that the show succeeded in implementing the sympathy and compassion around the main characters good and bad ones ! put in mind that at one point when your affection for a character that didn't get what it deserves from your perspective makes you angry about the whole show then you must give it the credit because it lead you to pick a side and that's the point !
one more important thing concerning this subject, a truly realistic series or a movie is not about demonstrating heroes or satisfying the need for justice and happy endings. and that's why after watching more than 40 series for a decade know, i can fairly say that got is one of the most realistic tv shows i ever saw even with dragons and dead walkers in it ! you see; this series is a character driven type of writing and despite what you may think the focus is not on the story but on the characters and their attitudes, personal evolutions and decisions, and how those, in turn, change the shape of the plot and the story as a whole.
there is three main decisions made in this season finales, killing the night king, burning king's landing to the ground, killing danny ! now those decisions are made by three different main characters; arya, danny and john those are by far the most developed and evolved ones throw out the series, the path they took and the endings they had are convenient just on the base of the story telling with all objectivity you can't say nothing about their progress! therefore the questions of who and why are settled in my opinion but how the decisions are made that's up for discussion we don't say perfection is in this show far away from that, and on the other hand we should not forget when it comes to cinematography this show nailed it for real !. same for the rest of the cast they all had their significant endings in accordance with their story lines no one was left behind am not saying deserved the endings they get that's the subjectivity am trying to avoid but a solid structural framework made most of the endings reasonable. and this take me to other category of critics which is based on the plot and how the twists aren't effective or less than expected which is already ironic as a statement ! from where i stand i get disappointed when i make the right assumption. doesn't mean that i should be impressed if you come up with something out of no where. a good plot twist is when you make a reason for it without paying attention from the spectators and that's what got succeeded in illustrating !
in total am satisfied it was a good wrap, it ended the only way it could have, given the circumstances. one more think! the message was strong by the melting of the throne! the moral is obvious and the game was ended, the position bran took doesn't really matter if you truly understand the point that the show want to transmit, so no need to make of it a big deal because it's no longer about who sits on the throne...
got is definitely on my top five list ! i would love to see a spin off of arya's adventures, beside the one related to the origins of the kingdoms as it was announced."

2012-03-24,kyzziistar,Not what TV should portray,1,"i thought for once there would have been a medieval series that my kids could watch, but to no avail, this one is on the banned list for my household. why does it seem every series ""needs"" sex? and not just normal, hidden sex, but graphic, and nothing any person under the age of 18 should ever see. for this reason, and for the reason they add so much extra the books don't have, so you think they can leave the graphic nudity of only women out. yes, i said it, this is another series targeting only showing women's nudity. granted it's not the plot, but there is too much for a normal couple, or family to enjoy. i know of series' that can leave out the graphic nudity, but still get amazing reviews. i am a family mom, nothing containing nudity or drugs enters my house without me knowing. this will turn into another camelot, plot and story line say one thing, but it's the graphic sexual nature that will end up getting the show taken off air. edit: for anyone who didn't like this series there are a few imdb users who take it upon themselves to harass anyone who didn't like it. they try to make you mad by assuming personal details that are completely false. and these people call themselves adults, they are nothing more than children trying to get a boner. i stand by my word that this is a horrible series. this is my opinion, that should concern no one else. if anyone else gets these harassing/threatening messages, simply ignore these kids. all they want is the satisfaction of making you mad, i have 3 kids; these immature toddlers are nothing compared to any mom raising kids. we have patience that will last a lifetime."

2013-12-27,noslen_zero,One of the Greatest of all times.,3,"most of television drama show has the something that they all share it, as the same, 99% of the series are one side character, in which its the story of one man/woman, while the rest of the cast rust being just sidetrack or supporting, in the game of thrones which its based on *the song of ice and fire novel* its on a league of his own, because the show has so many lead character and there is not a single person that can be pointed as the main character over the others, the plot its just wondefuly written with many plot/twist.its a survivor story in which there are so many possibilities, many character with complex personalities and morality, this its not the typical show with good guys vs the bad guys, its all about scheming and backstabbing."

2012-04-07,harleyjbanks,Absolutely the best show ever,10,"simply the best show i have ever watched. i am also a skeptic and quick to point out flaws and hollywood exaggerations. i cannot even put into words how good this series is. it has reinvented cinema for me. i generally only watch bbc and national geographic, etc as i cannot tolerate most of the rubbish on tv. i sincerely hope they make so many seasons of g>o>t that the polar ice caps will completely melt before they take this off the air... i have recommended this show to all my friends at work and outside of work. every single one of them are hooked and cannot stop watching. so a million teabags for game of thrones and everyone who helped put it together. you are the best thing that has happened in my life since particle physics. mrs. targaryen will you marry me?"

2012-04-08,beth8507,"A good show, but....",6,"i tried to read the books before this was ever a series, but the books moved so slowly, i lost interest. that happens to be the case with this series at some points. but i guess that happens in many series i've watched.i think the show is good overall, but i just have one huge complaint: the way that sex has consistently been portrayed in this series thus far. every time there is a sex scene or a supposed ""sensual"" scene, i am almost always repulsed. sex is always portrayed in a very negative light in this show. the men are the biggest douche,bags and then women get disrespected and treated as sexual objects. they are prostitutes and whores, or it's molesting your sister, or raping your forced-to-be-married-to-you wife.at least in spartacus, hot men were shown and there was equality on the nudity field. that doesn't happen in this series. and at least in spartacus some of the sex was actually respectable and some was about love. i have yet to see that in this show.i just hope it changes, because sex isn't suppose to be a thing of disrespectful douche-bags and dehumanization of women as it is consistently done in this show. it's repulsive in its current form.after reading other reviews, i have found that i am not alone in my opinion. lots of people, from europe especially, agree that americans just don't know how to behave about sex. this show accurately portrays the authors and producers screwed up attitudes about sex. plus, i also agree that sex is way overdone in this show."
2012-04-09,benodea1,"Watch it, NOW!",8,"often i see fantasy shows or movies on television, and as an avid reader, set out with very high expectations, hoping the show or movie will live up to the high standards set out by the book. sadly, it is often the case that the producers have either chosen a bad book (terrible to watch, but easy to make into a production), or a long book (amazing to read, but cringe, worthy when seen on screen). george r.r. martin's books are perfect in that they are the right size (per book) for a 10 hour series, and that they also contain the right mix of politics, sex and violence as plot devices. too much politics will result in a boring drama-fest, too much sex results in a story-lacking, poorly made porn film aimed at enticing male viewers only, and too much violence results in a hideous gore-fest that begins to become repetitive and almost boring, making the viewer tired of seeing the colour red. game of thrones successfully incorporates all three of these 'touchy' elements into a watchable and incredibly enjoyable television series, one of the best, possibly the best tv series i have ever seen. having read all the books, i can safely say that most, if not all the content in the series matches up neatly to the content in the books. the producers don't overdo anything, keeping to what is written and favouring a complex plot in the place of aimless special effects and video tomfoolery. if you are reading this review, unsure of whether you want to devote 70 hours of your life to this series (because once you start, you won't be able to stop until episode 10 of season 7, at which point you'll be crying because the series has ended), i would have to wholeheartedly advocate the series as one of the best you'll ever see. watch it, now."
2020-10-13,kathryn-leamon,Could have been great but too rapey and a rushed final season,10,"i wanted to be excited about this show but i was miserable watching it. while the characters were somewhat complex and the world,building was cool, the constant rape or threat of rape was unnecessary (and aesthetisizing rape for the camera is beyond disgusting. i just want a good fantasy series without the constant threat of having to sit through some horrible rape scene that wasn't even in the books). the magical elements felt random, unexplained, and under-utilized. the final season felt so rushed and unfortunately disappointed everyone."

2012-04-18,adampenfeather,The Vilest Most Peurile Garbage Ever Broadcast,10,"banal, puerile, putrid rubbish entirely bereft of art or merit filled to vomit point with the sickening ugly machinations of a diseased mind. how the participants who found themselves involved in this gross festering blight will face their folly in their old age hell only knows. the script and the acting is a excruciating embarrassment to behold.it is a disgrace to the film industry if that is where it claims its origins.it deserves to do more than just flop it should sink without trace in the deepest darkest cesspool imaginable never to see the light of day again, but no cesspool owner with a trace of self respect would admit such a vile despicable creation. a monkey with a lobotomy could have come up with a better screenplay. my colleagues consider my comments to be a tad mild."
2015-06-18,marcsteele95,Westeros is a far cry from Middle-Earth.,10,"for far too long did i put off watching this series because of my pre,conceived notion that it was a re-hashed lord of the rings rip-off. i have a feeling that many people who have not yet experienced game of thrones are those who have the same misconceptions that i had. i did enjoy the lord of the rings trilogy, but i found this tv series to be on a completely different level.sean bean's performance as the steely-eyed lord eddard stark is commendable, but it is peter dinklage and his portrayal of tyrion lannister, the witty and wise dwarf born in to privilege, that steals the show for me. it is very rare that a tv show can truly give the viewer a roller-coaster of emotions, but game of thrones certainly lives up to that billing. there are scenes that will make you laugh (though this is far from a comedy), scenes that will leave you sobbing, and scenes that will have you screaming at the action on the screen. episodes will finish and leave you with your jaw on the floor, eager to find out what happens next time. in short, you do not have to be a fan of epic fantasy to enjoy this series. if you are a fan of emotive story lines and fantastic acting along with some amazing special effects, then this is definitely for you."
2012-04-21,rod-s-edwards,Better than the books !,7,"saw series one & was so impressed by the quality of the plot & the acting that i went straight out & bought the series of books (6 with 2 still to be written). unfortunately, from book 2 onwards the books do not keep up any sort of pace & could easily have been condensed into 2 or 3 volumes. so, enjoy the tv series which is very true to the books (except that most of the main characters are portrayed as being twice as old as they were written). yes there is lots of sex & violence, but not more than would be expected at that time in (fictional) history. this is ""sparticus blood & sand"" not ""zena warrior princess"" series 2 is looking just as good. hope this helps."
2021-03-10,sreedhar99,All time best,9,"one of the best television series i had ever seen. the ending was a bit odd, but, that doesn't take the sheen off the series. would watch it all over again anytime."
2012-05-28,ramiagonistes,Something for everyone!,10,"first of all let me say that i have never read the books and had no preconceived notions about this show before watching it. i was hearing and seeing buzz for ""game of thrones"" and decided to see what all the fuss was about.i can't tell you how happy i am that i did! i don't know where to begin but let me start off by saying that this show has mass appeal. you would think that it would primarily catch the interest of fans of the book series or the same kind of geeky guys that are lord of the rings buffs. this is certainly true but once you get virtually anyone to watch an episode or two they will be hooked!to make my point i will use my fiancée as an example. she has no interest in any kind of fantasy type movies involving sword fights, dragons and mystical lands. got certainly has plenty of those things in spades but what it also has, and ladies please don't hate on me because you know it's true, is a shitload of drama! there are so many acts of betrayal and backstabbing you don't know which characters are frauds and which are trustworthy and honorable. imo the best thing that this show has going for it is it's cast of multi,dimensional characters. there are so many characters to follow, each of them unique, that it can become overwhelming at times. however, i would recommend that you don't grow too fond of anyone of the characters because in the crazy world of game of thrones anyone can be taken out at anytime!"
2018-02-08,wikota,The best show out there ever.,10,"simple as that, best show ever. a must see. totallly amazing and i love it. since season 1 to season 7, its just perfect. i cant wait for the last season coming in 2019, i´m sure the wait will be totally worth it."
2012-04-27,johnmac100,Awful,10,"well.... i just finished to watch the 2 episode of season 2 and i'm not impressed!! from the first few seconds of the first episode were that young boy have his face painted with black pen not mud (make up artist fault for sure) or the awful acting to the non attention to details. i really don't get it. even the story is sooooooo predictable that it make me roll my eyes to see another american rubbish medieval series. this for me is a notch better than zena warrior princess and that's mean not good. please do not compare this to lotr or you're dam too stupid to see the difference. i'm sure the books are fantastic to read but i hated the non attention to details in this series (people and places to clean, wolfs are husky dogs, clothes are to new and out of history context, etc....) but thanks for sean bean charisma and acting skills to make this series a bit more interesting then a pair of tits here and there. anyway not enough for me to watch the all series. overall... great to watch as a teenager perhaps or if you don't care of the above. peace"

2012-05-25,h_treno,"Highly understandable, even for those who have not read the books.",1,"just when i thought that i would never discover a medieval,themed tv series that was worth watching, i stumbled upon the game of thrones.i have always wanted to buy the song of ice and fire series by george r.r. martin, but never got to, which meant that my only idea regarding the show was that it would be like every other medieval-set series. boy, was i wrong. here are some reasons:the sets are wonderful, and could easily be differentiated. you'll never confuse winterfell with the wall, or king's landing with any other location. the combined elements of sex, violence, greed, love, etc, makes it very real. the absence of censorship is also good, because it removes the limits of the show, resulting to a very good series. lastly, the key actors are simply superb. (after watching the first season, i have made it a point to ensure that i will be the one who kills all the lannisters, especially joffrey - the antagonists are so antagonizing that whenever i remember them, i actually feel a sense of hatred surging inside of me.i can't wait for more! well done, hbo!"

2013-08-01,sebastianwaldberg,Quite bad actually,1,"so everyone is complaining about the series being to slow paced. i don't deny that, but the books are as well so there's not too much that can be done there. one thing that annoys me though is that this series get most of their good reviews because people like to watch the sex scenes, they barely even care about the plot. there's plenty of places where you can watch naked girls, i could name some for you if you want...another thing is that the plot has become to boring. during season 1 it was good and seemed to build up to something even better but then what happened? i know that the writers are just following the books but you can't let the audience get all excited for something big to come and then just drop it in the way that they did. the last thing is that i think they are plagiarizing the lord of the ring way too much, sure george martin has said that it has been one of his inspirations writing the books but really it's quite embarrassing to watch. to the people that has watch got but not watched lotr i recommend you do it and later on see what you think of the series.this series has almost become unwatchable for me nowadays and i'm not enjoying it when i watch it, i feel like the only reason why i watch it is to be done with it."
2012-06-03,ross-allen77,Extremely Good But Sensationalized,5,"first i must say that i have never seen a television show on the scale of game of thrones. the sets effects and costumes are amazing and really bring the world described in the books to life. everyone, especially the child actors, are extremely well cast and all give convincing performances. the story is compelling and does make you want to see more however, for me, there are a few things that let this series down. do not get me wrong, i love many american series and films, however, no one, not even the americans themselves, can say they are known for being subtle (or particularly realistic). the sex in this series is gratuitousness and feels like its just been thrown in because they think the audience will get bored if there isn't something going on every second. this really detracts from the realism of not only the events but also the relationships between the characters. i know that a certain amount of sex and violence comes with the genre and i didn't think the violence was too bad however, i find it hard to sympathize with characters where the majority of their personality centres around sexuality (e.g.constantly using prostitutes or raping women every five seconds). to be fair, however, the non,sexual relationships, such as between ayra and her father feel genuine and real. in short, i think game of thrones is a very good series and one i will definitely watch the second series of however, i feel the sensationalism detracts from the reality of the characters and their relationships."
2013-06-16,ckouchii,Overrated,9,"don't get me wrong this show is awesome cause it makes you really go inside the story of every family but i think people just overrated it too much details and unimportant elements are added which lower its quality also in my opinion, the amount of surprisingly murdered characters makes me want to stop watching the show in the end of every season but again must admit that it got the charisma that attracts me and forces me to watch it till the end. the costumes, castles, the variety of areas and the weird creatures are what actually makes game of thrones a special show wonderful show but i guess there are other amazing shows around too."

2012-06-04,jrzanaglio,As true to the books as possible given the time restrictions,5,"i watched the first season before knowing anything about the storyline, and it sucked me in; it was totally incredible! since then i've listened to 4 of the unabridged audiobooks in the series, all of which were extremely well done from my vast experience with audiobooks. i knew the storyline before season 2 began, yet i still couldn't wait for each new episode to air. having read the books, the episodes helped to fill in bits i may have missed or misunderstood in the books, so the 2 mediums melded together nicely. this isn't a typical cliffhanger series with new stories written each week to fill a quota; it's a television adaption of the books which are gritty, ruthless, and are completely unpredictable in their turn of events, just the way you would expect things to be if this world actually existed. it stays within the story's boundaries given the limited time allowed for the series. like the lord of the ring's, both film series are linear and tell the story, but both book series are more colorful with much more depth to the stories, more sidestories and character development than the time restrictions allow. i would recommend to anyone who likes the show even a little to read the books or listen to the audiobooks (roy dotrice really makes the characters in the book come to life!)."
2019-12-01,jimboli,Dire ending,8,"i gave this a one star. hear me out. this series started off great, was in line to be the one of the best series ever made. however it ended so badly the rest of the series was voided. i know some people still rank it high because season one to six were so good. but if i watch a film and the first 60 minutes are amazing but the last 30 minutes are awful, well for me the last half hour is still important. so for me this is a total fail. i won't be rewatching any and i wish i hadn't started knowing the ending would be so poorly rushed and delivered."
2013-07-25,lienic,Brilliant!,7,"i must say this is the best series of its kind, i have never seen something as deep, real, well done as this one.the argument, music, scene is as best as it can be. there are 2 things you must like to fully enjoy this series. first is medieval stories and the second is mythology. in each case the most enjoyable is the relations between people, and that has no era...after this you just need to know that: everything you expect to happen will not; every character can become the your hero of the episode; , all types of people are represented in the story and you will know at least one of each kind very well during the various episodes; and the most important, it doesn't mater if you like someone or if you hate them, in a real war everyone suffers and the majority dies.so, in conclusion, expect a lot of emotions from you side as during each episode you will for sure feel a lot of hate, angry, love and sadness."
2013-03-13,jjsteeler8,Best TV Show by far,9,"yes, this is my favorite tvshow, and i have seen a lot of series such as lost, breaking bad, white collar, greys anatomy and many others, but still this is my favorite one. no i have not read the books but my cousin have told me that's the same thing. i love game of thrones because of it's story, the scenarios, the actors, the visual effects. i mean this series has everything anyone could love of any tv show. the story at first is a little bit strange and you may not get anything but after at leas t5 episodes of the first season you know very good the story and how is it going. and if you relate with a specific character it may be killed, yes in this tvshow many main character got killed but i think this makes the series more special, it's completely different to other shows when the main character never gets killed. the custome its another thing that makes game of thrones very special, its absolutely awesome and perfect, again, even more than other series such as lost or ncis. i can't simply wait for more of this series."

2017-08-28,meerootzky,"This review is about the season 7 only, may contain spoilers",7,"so... we have finally reached the time where there are absolutely no books, to get the source material for the show... first, i am a big asoif fan and i really enjoyed the series... until now. benioff and weiss just prove that they completely don't know and don't understand the characters of got, and absolutely don't know and don't understand their audiences. and what is worst that they don't care.first lets address the elephant in the room: ed sheeran. what were they thinking? probably something like: ""it's okay to have a cameo of a metal band mastodon, so let's get another one... this time from the hottest star that will give us pop cred! damn, bieber isn't interested? who is the other one? ay, mate do you have a daughter? ask, her whats hip this season... and will get him to sing beside the fire, and everybody will be happy! and for a good measures let us throw a funny line, about it being his new single. genius! can we get rihanna as a dothraki bed,warmer in the next season?"" who actually thought that it was a good idea?! it do not fit. the main audience (i mean people who grow up reading the books and are really invested) don't mix with such a pop turd like sheeran. sure, the casual boob-n-blood audience do. but lets ask them anything about the series... and the answer will be: ""yeah boobs! ...and this snow guy and the boob-queen with dragons. yeah boobs!"" with this out of the way let's take shots on the actual show... and yeah i dare to address the boob-crowd!welcome to the land of coincederos where everything happens via coincidence. in the earlier seasons and even in the books there where some coincidences, but season 7 level of coincidences/deus ex machinas/teleports and time traveling is just ridiculous... in the prison scene (no spoilers) when it's revealed that everyone know or are connected one way or another... how many people live there in the 7 kingdoms? like a hundred? by this time i think less that a hundred, because the characters without names are just tokens, not people tokens... right? the deus ex machina level of this season is just cringe-worthy or should i say dany ex machina? and the rules of time and travel... what rules?another thing... remember when your favorite got people were character developed? forget it! now it's just like: 'dude we should expand this ones character, to make the journey he or she had meaning-full and well organized... but we can't write witty dialog! no problem! just write a sitcom-esque dialog with a place for laughs and distract them with a fan service - i've heard that the manatees that write for family guy are looking for a new job, let's hire them... all! they will never feel the difference!"" the dialogues... wow... so bad.. the awkward pauses before the unfunny punchlines, the pretending to be clever and deep... made me angry... so angry... what about the distinct and nuance personalities of every character that martin created? forget about that! have a fan service! look missandeis boobs! another fan service! now let's address some of the issues i had with the show earlier: jon snow is the worst fleshed out character in the series (another think no one dared to address... but... check out jon in the books, then in the show... then i'll leave you with that...), so what should we do? let's make him a lovable duffus! brilliant! everybody loves a bit socially awkward lovably duffusess don't they? and also let's make other characters also lovable duffuses! yey! remember that one character that was in that one episode centuries ago, and is really important in the books? no? so what he has a flaming sword of bad-assness! yey! let's throw as many characters as we can! we still didn't used: the damphyr, patchface, strong belwas, edric, mya, quentyn, lady stoneheart, moqorro, aegon targaryen and other thousands of character! and let's us not give justice to characters we used once and forgot like: gendry, thoros, or beric. let's get them back and use unfunny line showing that we are aware of the jokes made about one of the forgotten characters. ""we are so clever and self aware."" yay! bravvvoooo! ""and also... flaming swords! yeah! bring it on!""to close my bitter review... i was skeptic to the thought there's no source material to look at in the last season. but they really made it work. i was waiting for this season just like the other guy... i was never going to write any critique about any thing, but i am so horribly disappointed... so angry... that i could not even wait for the last episode... the bitterness is rising and gaining it's strength every day, leaving me broken... i don't know if i can even finish watching the show... i was waiting for the book for so long... and i will wait a bit longer i think. i also hope that martin will finish the book different than the show... to reward the long time fans, who really care about the fates of his heroes, and who as i am are poisoned by the strangler of benioffs and weiss's ideas... anger."
2015-06-08,bassk-420-657874,The shark has been jumped.,10,"it always felt like this show was sitting just below excellence. feeling the need to take a cheeky giggle at a nipple or dick every so often to make the viewer pay attention.d+d the producers of the show clearly think you're not very clever if you watch this program. you need a pair of boobs every so often to keep you going through a story far too difficult to follow for a tv simpleton. that's nonsense, and yet they do it every episode. no one in game of thrones is looking to fight for what they believe in, or for honour, or for freedom. they're too busy wandering from north to south and east to west finding their next companion for ludicrous out of the blue sex scenes. if it's not sex, then the character will probably die at any moment too. killing characters makes a show deep and clever, no one is safe...that's what you're supposed to believe. the boobs are classy, the deaths are clever. shut up and eat some popcorn and stop thinking about the world or questioning the dubious quality of this show. if you wanted clever you'd read a book, but lalalalalala there isn't a book like this anywhere on the planet and you should definitely not look for one!the way this story has proceeded is pathetic. shallow. half baked and weak throughout. characters have no depth what so ever. tv can be excellent and characters can be complex, just check out breaking bad for a quick and easy example. shows do not need constant death or constant sex to sell. we don't need silly one liners throughout every scene. the story to game of thrones was supposed to be epic, and yet it's now just one big story about how a pretty girl with nice boobs and 3 dragons is going to fly across the world and become queen.this is not good enough and the shark has officially jumped."
2012-07-15,clutch2006,season 2 episode 7,10,"i am only on season 2 episode 7, but the story line has rapidly gotten away from the book and i don't understand why. where are the kids from deepwood moat that help the young stark boys escape? i have read the series 4 times now and never remember the dragons getting stolen. how do these changes help the story for tv??? it is fun to watch the story made into a mini,series, but i think i'm done watching. they should call it something different, if they are gonna change it so much from the books. i'm really disappointed. they could have done better and, at this point, i don't understand the walk away from the original storyline."
2017-08-23,evandrocj,"Amazing, but don't justify 7 years of production",10,"no doubt this is one of the best series ever made, partly because of the final quality of the production, but i really think the creators could have focused more on the plot and on don't taking 7 years to bring it to an end. happy the one who will start to see when the last season is out."
2012-07-27,rashmisshetty,Love the series,9,"the tv series is one of the best i have seen in a long time. i have read all the books in the fire and ice series and the tv series remains true to the books in most parts. not disappointed one bit. my favorite character in the series is tyrion lannister and peter dinklage plays the character to the hilt. me a little disappointed that george r r martin does not belt out books as fast as i would want him to. but i guess it takes a lot of effort to come up with story of this magnitude and imagination. the story gets better as narrative continues. what is most fascinating about the story is the contrast in behaviour,attitude, morals of the different central characters example:arya stark and sansa stark.nobody is good or bad they are just different shades of grey , some closer to white like lord eddard stark and some closer to black like jamie lanister. waiting/watching how hbo will out do itself in the next season."

2021-05-07,hosseiny69,A stormy start and a dazzling but disappointing ending,10,a stormy start and a dazzling but disappointing ending many characters were abandoned..it was clear that the producers just wanted it to end.
2015-04-20,cstallworth,I don't get it.,7,"i am up to the red wedding, so anyone past that is very safe from any possible spoilers. there should not be any, but better safe than sorry.sure the production values are good, and so is the acting. but all i get out of this show, is the fact that good people are fuc^ed over and or slaughtered, and the evil people win. all i get out of this show is the fact that a piece of shi^ queen, and her insane inbread son the king, get away with all types of barbaric behavior, for years. i watch a show to see some good, some retribution, not babies and innocents being tortured and or must plain murdered. i am on a marathon, and am up to the red wedding. may be in season 20 there will be someone to root for. soneone to avenge all the evil and brutality. or is this evil and brutality what draws people to this show.? i like good winning but i do not want to wait 10 years.."
2014-12-12,niklerus,Brutally overrated,1,"can't see why this is so popular and gets such a high score on imdb! at rare instances it is fairly enjoyable but most of the time it moves forward in such a slow pace that you will ask yourself over and over again; why are people so crazy about this show? disturbs me that it has a rating close to breaking bad, which has rightfully earned a high score (i give it 10/10). i wonder if it is the teenagers enjoying the quite frequent display of tits and ass?it's a high budget production which shows and most of the actors do a decent job even though i find peter dinklage to weak an actor to have such a high profile on the show.game of thrones is a sleeping pill and the occasional exciting moments are not worth it.now that i have started watching it i can't stop, sleeping pill or not, i still want to know how it ends."
2019-05-20,rohit-nsit08,Worst ending possible,9,this has perhaps the worst and boring ending i have ever seen
2019-06-28,adis_gates1980,Best ever,10,"for me maybe the most powerful series of all time! but all of us who have watched everything from the first to the last episode, all the tension, the pain, the sadness, i think we deserve a relaxing end and a bit more sadism. as such, we remain empty, confused. i personally prefer not to have seen the last episode because i would remember the series as perfect. so ... huge minus the latest episode .. i think the resident wanted to leave a strong impression on the viewers, and he succeeded. but in that impression prevails the grief and sorrow at this end of the series. i have the impression that the last season was made rush, and awkward. i'm going to remember the series at the wrong end"
2021-10-09,wurzel1963,Biggest disappointment of anything I have seen.,7,i don't get it. i do not understand how this got such high reviews. it is nothing more than soft porn / passive raping / slasher.two moments i did enjoy were when the irritating young king was killed and the end credits of the last episode. apart from those two moments i found i was easily distracted. paint drying is more entertaining than this collection porn clips and blood thirsty killings. i will never promise to watch another box set to the day i die because of this utter garbage.
2019-04-23,teodorsavic,Milking a dead cow,1,"loved the tv show, the story, the cast, the play, scenery, everything.. until the last couple of seasons. nothing is happening, the entire episodes go by in some random boring scenes and then the last 2 or 3 minutes something actually happens. this tv show could have ended 2 seasons ago, if they didn't keep it on life support i order to earn some more money from it.
this could have been easily 8 or 9 stars but the last season really made me feel extremely pissed off. they could've at least made the last season good as the couple of the first ones. episode two ended and still alnost nothing happened."
2019-05-28,philip_reema,Confused with the way things ended,10,"so i watched got, the whole 8 season back to back in 2weeks. i doubt i will ever love a tv series as much as i loved got. as everyone else has expressed, i am of the same opinion that season 8 is a big let down. i feel cheated and hugely let down by the ending. jon was resurrected for what!
underwhelming death of the white walker.
cercei was assumed dead, no one confirmed.
point of the the big secret that jon is a targarean and true heir to the throne, was?
bran being the 3eyed raven did what exactly??
arya, the girl with no face and her power, used it for what?? yes she killed walder and his family but that could have been done without those powers too.
bran the broken is king now!! what???
i am still in denial and have my own ending which i am going with.all that said, i would watch the whole thing again and again for the amazing characters and story."
2019-06-01,dmkpor,It could have been a great ending...but it wasn't.,3,"overall game of thrones is a stellar character,driven medieval fantasy with magic and dragons. the title tell you all you need to know. power. the pursuit of power, the attainment of power, and the difficulty of holding power. the question is, can they stick the landing. they did not. they had a choice in season 8 to be shakespearean or to be dynasty. to be or not to be a tragedy or to be a cliche hollywood trope. trope it is. in the beginning the stark clan is not much of a power player but the lannister are. by the end they both are consummate duplicitous players. the ""gaslighting"" of daenerys and jon over the revelation they are aunt and nephew, which neither were aware of until revealed to them is the worst part of the epic failed ending. a few more minutes in each episode of them attempting to deal with the information, showing them attempting to stay connected physically beyond the meager attempts shown would have made a difference. it left me wondering, does he still really love her? one doesn't know because there no scene of him or her alone struggling with his or her thoughts holding something that represents each other, crying or clutching that object. hell, jamie and cersei got a better fully realized emotional death scene then daenerys. and daenerys was just as psychically wounded a character as cersei was. why is her death scene so mechanical, cold and to borrow a phrase, done ""with extreme prejudice?"" the justification. she is turning into colonel kurtz"" and ""hitler."" actually, she is ""gaslighted"" into it by the starks. she is no longer useful to them and way too powerful to control. she has the dragon. that makes her a superpower. it's hard to kill the dragon now. she is not. her willingness to use violence is open and has always been known, but so is arya's. she and jon and arya are probably the least duplicitous main characters in the series. the rest of them get others to do the dirty work. the other epic fail of the series end is the unwillingness the treat the starks and tyrion as the cunning players for the game of pursuing the throne. they are portrayed as survivors and heroes of the game for the throne. they are not. nor is tyrion. as for the assassination of daenerys, jon is reduced to a plot prop as ""an errand boy, sent by grocers to collect a bill "" to borrow another phase. finally, drogon torching the throne and melting it to the ground isn't because it's represents evil. it's because it belongs to daenerys and no one will ever sit on it again. end of story."

2016-10-02,ts-ricardo,The world's most expensive snuff film.,1,"i might very well be late to the party, but i couldn't go without reviewing this series.it actually scares and sickens me that 'game of thrones' has been receiving such high praise all throughout , i honestly couldn't find anything redeemable about it, but i still gave it two stars out of ten in case i'm forgetting something (hardly, though).since it is based on a book, some of my points may also apply to g.r.r. martin's ''work'', who looks as much a psycho as the directors of this atrocious show.'game of thrones' is the most wicked television series (include movies) i have ever seen, a madman's hymn about their own deranged fantasies. from the very first episode you get the feeling that something is wrong: that violence and senseless gore are the norm, that limbs and heads are being chopped just because, to trigger the inner sociopath in the audience. i have no doubt whatsoever that the creators of this show get aroused at the sight of spilled guts and the slit throat of a newborn. 'game of thrones is nothing it pretends to be. it tries to be political and full of intrigue, when it is not. the half-arsed politics are just a means for another death or sex scene, which is all this series is about. the world's most expensive snuff film. one (automatic) excuse you'll hear from the fans, should you negatively critique their beloved masterpiece, is that it is a realistic portrait of medieval times, when very clearly it is not (for anybody with the minimal grasp of european history), and, in fact, just another disgustingly sold lie to keep this show's easily gullible audience glued to the screen, drooling at the rape of yet another royal vulva.keep your children away from this. worringly, many are watching this vile, depraved and repulsive soft porno right now. 'game of thrones' is a blatant insult to human intelligence and decency. shame on everyone involved in it."
2013-05-19,arranbreck18,Outstanding TV Series.,10,"this tv show is an amazing vortex of love, betrayal and gore. all of the violence is realistic and the sex/adult themes are handled maturely. i have watched ever since the first episode and it hooks and you in and keeps you watching. there are many characters, so, to hold attention, there are only a few characters focused on per season, and they are developed very well. you will find yourself loving or hating these characters and the acting is just incredible.each and every actor plays their part. this is a television masterpiece and should not be underestimated. if you are not a watcher, then you should begin watching and you will thank me personally , and find yourself siding with houses before you know it.i cannot describe the magnificence of this show in a review, so you should watch it and have an opinion of your own. i, myself, do not understand why so much hatred goes toward this show, but i strongly disagree and hope that others who watch this series agree with my opinion.in short, this tv series is magnificent and deserves every award that it has won and its rating of 9.4/10. it is worth the watch - definitely!"
2016-06-18,andromar-522-60376,Disappointed about Arya's story line (may contain some spoilers),1,"arya revelation is so dumb. there is no twist in what happened so far and what i remain with is the feeling that all her story was for nothing actually. only cheap tricks on the audience to create something interesting on her story line, when in fact there is nothing deep behind that: she walks carelessly on the streets when she knows she.s followed by an assassin, then her wounds which at first seem deadly, miraculously heals almost entirely over night. all these only to run away from what she was meant to be. so unless hbo comes up with more on the background of her story and a continuity of her training as a black assassin in the next series, it would be sad.edit after ep 10, season 6: arya finally came up with something to back her story up, but sill there are some gaps in how she really left house of black and white with no repercussions.. jaqen h'ghar once said: "" she is meant to be more than a faceless"" . so is she becoming more than that or he forgot about his statement. was all of that a plan for her or just a coincidence ?"

2013-04-04,enigmaoxox,Absolutely Brilliant!,9,"when i have free time and look to be entertained, i seldom reach for a book or engage in the arduous task of reading through an expansive novel. so for me, whether or not game of thrones remains true to its original roots factors little when it comes to the entertainment value of a movie or television production.when it comes to cinematic entertainment, i want to be fully engaged in the story and characters presented on screen. i want to be surprised and kept on the edge of my seat by clever writing that makes the unpredictable twists and turns of a story plot actually make sense. actors, whose craft is so convincing, that whether you love or hate the characters they portray, they passionately inspire you to feel something even if you find yourself shouting at the screen like a complete buffoon as if watching some sporting event. and, if left biting my nails at the end of each episode in anticipation for the following week's program ,-- i'll gladly pay the extra monthly fee to hbo just for the privilege! game of thrones, in my humble opinion, is all that and more. in regard to overall quality, i find it even surpasses the majority of expensive movie productions being released in local theaters. while i'm hardly a professional critic, history expert or avid reader of fiction novels --- i am a happy and passionate fan of this superb hbo series and simply wish to add my sincerely applause to the cast and crew that made this hbo production the enormous success that it is. thank you!"

2019-05-21,emre_xxl,A fascinating show with a terrible ending,1,"game of thrones is undoubtly the biggest tv show project to it's date. it has the quality of a blockbuster movie fx, cgi and acting,wise, and even a better scenario and story telling because it's based on a very well-written books series, a song of ice and fire.but everything changed after the show catched up to the book series it's based on, and producers started to write their own scenario. the quality of writing gradually declined after season 5 when this happened and hit rock bottom at the and of the show. the ending was terrificily dissapointing for most of the fans, and made literally no sense in my own opinion.it could be a show worth of 9 or even 10. but last seasons made the show a cliche-hub and even ridicilous sometimes. i'm sorry for the wasted opportunity."

2013-01-11,jacksonrapley,Unjustified negativity,10,"firstly, to dispel the views of many a reviewer, i am not a fan boy of either fantasy nor the books from which this television series are adapted from.secondly, i would like to spend a paragraph addressing the views on violence and nudity. i cannot for the life of me understand the accusations of sexually explicit content and hideous violence being completely unfounded, doing nothing for the show. in that accusation alone you disprove your claim. by admitting your repulsion, you have simultaneously admitted that the tone and setting have worked perfectly. you are supposed to be repulsed. you are meant to think these scenes are common place, and against your will or not, they absolutely do add to the tone that the writer was attempting to achieve. a time of different morals, casual exploitation, and a world where men rule and women are objects. this only makes the leading female characters of the show all the more enthralling when they dominate a scene and act as a catalyst for huge plot twists. joffrey's mother is a constant schemer and her character contrasts perfectly with the ""hundreds"" of naked women on screen (a gross over,exaggeration).to comment on the violence and nudity in such a manner only depicts to a viewer like myself that this show, simply put, does not adhere perfectly to your tastes. personally, without the violence and adult themes, this show really would be about as gritty as silky knickers. grow up and accept the fact that in this day an age, you cannot get the budget to produce an adult-aimed tv show and omit violence. where it differs from lord of the rings is that it attempts to at least partly set itself against the back drop of the notoriously gritty middle ages. what were you expecting? fairy's? every single act of violence serves to remind you that this is a vicious age. it comes from all characters, sometimes feeling forced, sometimes feeling gratuitous. more often than not however, it comes from the characters who themselves love violence (the hound, joffrey etc...) given the sheer volume of plots, sub-plots, characters and material to process, i think you are being completely unreasonable expecting some critic friendly genius masterpiece that equals the sopranos for complexity and realistic drama. the sopranos is set in a real city, in the current age, don't be so ridiculous as to cast the same eye over these two shows.i saw a review whereby somebody had watched ""6 minutes"" and dismissed it as drivel. you honestly expect somebody to take your review seriously!? it is without doubt a slow burner, the characters are not given enough screen time per episode... maybe because it is an hour long and there are 7 divisions of character to depict. rest assured early viewer, the characters screen time will add up by the second series. you will begin to understand in greater detail the motives and development of them, and if you can stomach the odd bit of violence and sex- hell, if you are even enough of a shameful human being to actually enjoy these things on screen (as i am) then you will love this show, you will appreciate its place on the television today, and you will ignore the opinionated television snobs who have watched two episodes and feel it necessary to moan about the adult content, on an adult themed tv show. don't watch it, don't give a review on it. i have never felt it necessary to watch sex in the city, i know it does not appeal to my taste. if i did, i would comment that it is shameful rubbish that warps the minds of human beings far more than an epic fantasy drama set a thousand years ago does. but i don't, because it is not a show that is meant to appeal to me. it is not made for people like me.game of thrones is well worth a chance. i gave it a chance and i do not regret it."
2019-05-26,jphommek,Favorite show,10,"i don't think they'll ever be a television show that is more talked about than game of thrones. even with an underwhelming last season, it is still easily the most we'll made and beautiful show you can hope to watch on tv."
2019-05-21,balaban-lolobi,8th season ruined everything,10,quite honestly all i can think about last season is someone intentionally sabotaged the show . it was like they were in a hurry just to finish it and get rid of it.
2019-01-12,wildflowerxxx2004,The biggest rubbish I have EVER seen.....,10,"unfortunately, after finishing seeing all the series, after all that wasted time, i can only say that it was the biggest rubbish i have ever seen.....and, i also have one advice for parents: keep it away from your children!!! as faraway as you can.... it is a disgusting image of a savage, primitive world, based solely on torturing people (mostly young women and children) and animals...."
2019-05-13,arshadmansoor-593-370859,Fantastic Season,6,"this tv series is magnificent! i read a book and i must say that a game of thrones is one of the best books i've read. so when i first heard that hbo will do a series on the this book i was thrilled but i was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. but i must say that i was wrong and that the series is better than i thought it would be. much better!while i watched the first episode i had the same excitement as the time when i first read the book. hbo has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. sean bean was born for the role of eddard stark. costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. actors are perfect for the role they play in the series.for me the biggest surprise of the series i figure daenerys targaryen. emilia clarke actress who plays daenerys targaryen is more beautiful than i imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book.the wall is a lot different than i had imagined, but in a good way.the series revolves around eddard stark and his family. he has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. eddard stark is ruler of the north and close friend of king robert who needs his help in ruling the seven kingdoms.the seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since king robert took the throne. but nothing is ever as it seems. within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. to the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten."
2013-06-22,benmyers20112,Absolutely Amazing,1,****contains spoilers****this is one of the best tv series i have seen in a long time. i am yet to read the books but if the tv series is anything to go by then the books will be outstanding.this has to be one of the only tv programs i have ever seen where main characters are killed off throughout the series for instance eddard stark being beheaded in series one was a massive shock to me as i thought he was going to go far being as he was a main character. also the battle of the red wedding was another shock being as not only one main character was killed off there were 2 potentially 3 and the fact that they slaughtered a pregnant woman.this is a must watch.

2019-05-21,chenhuiatschool,The last season is just disappointment,10,"i have been trying to defend this show's last season since ep.1 however i couldn't even convince myself for the terrible ep.6
nothing can be so disappointing considering it had such great season 1,5. so complicated people relationships and after all, great details and storytelling. now they just threw everything into garbage, including my love."
2019-05-20,spyrospal,Awful 8 season,8,if you don't see the last season of this series don't bother!2 years of waiting for this finale????? are you serious? for my opinion stop watching the series at 7th season.4 stars for previous seasons only!
2013-07-29,jackdance,Captivating,9,"not for a long time has television seen a show of such allure. game of thrones has taken me as well as thousands of other viewers by our ears and eyes into a new world, one that we become emotionally attached to. when starting such a series, one must be skeptical, but no fear, this is a ride you want to stay on. perfectly cast, and entertaining and informational to even the people who have not read the novels, the creators of the show have hit this one out of the ballpark. i personally have become engrossed and am always craving more of my favorite house's adventures in westeros.thank you, hbo, for taking me to a new place for an hour at a time."
2014-02-17,siran424,A good quality show......,2,"the sheer size of the cast and the way in which the show manages them, by providing ample time for each and every single one of them in itself is a master,piece. coupled with an amazing plot and some fantastic dialogues this truly is the best in tv as of now.the ""computer generated imagery"" in the show is almost perfect.locations are perfectly chosen and are apt for the various situations that arise in the show.it also has a good mix of action, drama and fantasy.as for as the deviations from the book is concerned, i don't know anything as i haven't read them..."
2019-05-20,tonimichelle2,Stop at season 6,10,never have i been more devastated and shocked by the ending of a show. it's truly heartbreaking that they made 6 seasons of the most amazing television i'd ever seen and then ended it with 2 seasons of utter garbage. i encourage everyone to watch the first 6 seasons. i give them 10 stars. my overall 1 rating is because breaking bad is once again the best show ever and it should rank higher.
2013-09-14,nicolaschavez1,"""Game of Thrones"" is a great TV series full of passion and adventures.",1,"game of thrones is an american fantasy drama television series created for hbo. this is the series show, which i like, and inspires me to create a huge story of ""the caribbean's kingdom"" which is my ultimate goal concern. game of thrones is my selected story: written by george r. r. martin, a media veteran author, with many relevant writes on movies and tv stories. in 1991 he finally shows his talent with the acclaimed tv series, ""the son of ice and fire"" subsequently in 1994 he appeared with his fabulous written series ""game of throne"" which rocketed him to the sky, but succeed sometimes, is a little hard to drink. the critics. started to compare him with j r r tolkien's ""lord of the ring"" "" and "" middle,earth."" but even the normal similitude determined for the genre, the comparison is counted improperly. these guys, david benioff and d. b. weiss, work in the adaptation for hbo; it is an adaptation of a song of ice and fire, george r. r. martin's series of fantasy, which the audience has received with a great acceptation."
2013-03-10,martstebbz,pure fantasy,1,"wot a television series, if you like anything fantasy then this is for you, it has it all, i'm just gutted the seasons are only 10 episodes long(or is it 12, not sure ) then its a long year to get your fix of another.....great stuff and keep it coming...longer seasons please please please. if you love fantasy then this is definitely for you, the casting is superb, the acting is superb, the costumes are awesome, and the scenery is something else, even the music is brilliant, i cant put down in words how much i love this show, and count the days to the next episode or season, i wont even watch any trailers that are released so that i get more compulsive viewing...again 10/10 sheer brilliance, i'm going to read the books next."
2021-08-03,blaz-novak8,Shame,10,"it had every chance to be among the greatest shows ever made, instead it will be remembered as the prime example of a show becoming completely botched. while the production values in the last 2 seasons are astonishing and the show still looks amazing, nothing could paper over the grand canyon sized cracks of the writing. even the best characters turn into complete and utter morons, the show goes from punishing main characters for their bad decisions to giving them plot armor that even a nuclear bomb going off next to the character couldn't destroy and when convenient for the writers, characters get the ability to teleport. our joy turned to something worse than ashes in our mouth."
2013-03-17,lewisflinders927,Beyond excellent,10,"what more can be said about this that already hasn't? if you're sat reading this review wondering weather or not you want to sit down and watch this then stop reading and watch it.for those of you that have chosen to carry on reading then let me just try and begin to tell you just how good this show is.from the very first moment you watch this show and see the opening credits you will be propelled into a world of betrayal, love, honour, adultery, blood, guts, war, dragons, mystery, and a vast army of different characters bringing this all together for you on your screen.it truly is a feast for the eyes. if you want all the above in one tv show then is it.so go out, buy it and watch it."
2014-02-09,shwicylily,Get ready for awesomeness overload!,10,"the first time i watched this show i was stunned! it is just so good! i have watched all the episodes, and i still can't believe how detailed and complicated this show is! got doesn't dumb things down, or make them simpler so anyone can understand. you have to really get into the show, and most of all, expect the unexpected. in this show, nothing is obvious, nothing is as it seems. main characters are killed, dreams are ruined, and most unusual alliances are made. don't have a favorite character because , surprise, surprise, he's dead in the next episode,and so is his wife, and mother, and unborn child, and even his pet! yeah, i'm talking about robb stark. the show is also very detailed, has good special effects and cgi, and watching this show you'll get sucked right into a new world full of new places to explore, people to meet and kill, and cultures and languages to learn! watch this show, and expect the unexpected, but be warned, you'll be suffering from heartbreak in a few episodes!"
2013-03-23,ghostila,Bad,10,"i don't like fantasy stuff and this show is just the worst i have ever seen, i can't understand why so many people like it. it's just horrible and annoying, i hate it! first time i saw it i almost puked, the characters were so annoying and even the main characters died, what is this show even about , death and war? i mean the actors are so emotionless and boring, you can see that they hate to work for this tv show. i mean seriously it's the first time i saw this show and i already hate it, how is this even possible without sucking so much? who is the audience that likes this show, who? nerds and wow-players, i mean seriously why do people watch this when there are so many better shows."
2019-08-18,martinokeeffeis,Game changer,8,"what a show. despite season 8 feeling rushed it was still the greatest tv show ever produced. top quality writing, plot development and a fantastic cast which really made you step into westeros in every episode. will be missed."

2013-03-30,casperdae,Just read below!,10,"to create a show as complicated and beautiful as game of thrones you need many ingredients. first you must add a dab of medieval england and lord of the rings. you then add a pinch of sex and nudity. 3 table spoons of war and violence, a whole bag of love, deception and revenge, you mix this with the lengths people will go for power and add a little dwarf and there you have it, the beautifully crafted show game of thrones!the genius of game of thrones however is not all that i mentioned above but rather the characters. everyone in the long list of complicated characters is so different yet all seem so real. the genius dwarf tyrion, the honourable eddard stark and the cunning littlefinger. all these characters hook you in so much that you in a way don't care about the main plot as long as they live. that is why i believe game of thrones is a must see."
2013-06-07,stephanierf_10,Not a flattering reflection of the book!,10,"***spoiler alert***spoiler alert***spoiler alert***spoiler alert***i'm reading the first book and i'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what i just saw on episode 1. i don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? i only watched episode 1 of season 1 and that is all i will watch, for reasons i will make known below. before that, i would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.characters: first of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which i'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? jon snow is not at all what i pictured him to be...i mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. however, most other characters do look a lot like i would have imagined (esp. arya and ned), just not jon.when the show began it completely butchered the scene of the night watch men who encountered the others. the wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. i know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. the execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about bran's big question? following the execution, the dire wolves scene was mishandled as well. the actor playing jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. the actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. i was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is far less important than, say, the scene where ned and robert were underground paying respects to the dead. that scene deserved more than it was given. they didn't bring robert and ned's relationship to life, instead they make robert look like a man,whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). the king should be hardened, but with a softness that only ned can bring out in him...mark addy is not robert baratheon. no, no, no. i'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...boo!the sex scene with the imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...i mean that was just completely unnecessary. so many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. the book did not handle sex this way at all! also, daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. i'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and i don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. the sex scene between her and drogo was not handled well either because it made drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). they didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? i mean, really? that scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). now, the sex scene of cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...i will admit that much. pros: the costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. that's it. you can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though. overall impression:-the necessary scenes were rushed. -important details were completely neglected. -some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged. -sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women. -most of the nudity is unnecessary and is overwhelmingly uneven (all full-on naked women) -props and scenery are nice. -whorehouse scene completely fabricated.please read the book. you'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry. now i'm off to read the book some more, but i think i've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall ""a game of thrones"" experience. i don't even know if i'll finish it now, but i definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.last words: the actress playing daenerys is so beyond wrong. i actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!bleh! >:("
2013-04-04,amy_smith_93,Wow,6,"i kept being pestered to watch this... two weeks later, i'm completely hooked and on my second viewing of both series.the best thing about the show is the fact that you always want to watch another episode after one has finished. it's quick paced, and with so much going on at once, there's never a dull episode. somehow, you really start to connect with their world and grow strong emotions for characters (ahem joffrey i hate you)i also love how you don't know who's going to die next... purely exhilarating and i can't wait for more of season 3 to be released!after reading these reviews, i can't understand how anyone can rate this less than a 9 , there are very few flaws if any, and it feels like game of thrones fills a huge gap in tv. there's nothing like this show and i'm dreading for the day when we are given the last episode... just watch it to believe it."
2014-05-12,upasaniapurv,Dinklage makes a better Tyrion than one in the books!!,10,"i have been a game of thrones fan way before i saw the actual series. i have had the privilege to read the books (some more than once) and i find the series one of the best written works ever. the tv series on the other hand digresses (naturally) from some topics. even then, it is one of the best series i have ever watched! tyrion lannister for me is by far the best character on the show. he is witty, charming and multifaceted; the fact that peter dinklage has successfully managed to capture and emulate. there are several other characters; cersai, jon snow, arya and danyerys who stand out.all in all, the one of the best series to watch!!"
2019-05-28,conyeo,Bad ending .😫,1,great beginning but the ending was such a big disappointment .
2019-05-20,emira21,I wish I could give it a 10...,1,"i loved this show more than any tv series i've watched before and although i wasn't particulary a fan of fantasy genre, i devoured all the information i can find about got and read all asoiaf books as well as watching documentaries about its lore and history. got marked the beginning of a new era for me.needless to say, this show marked the beginning of a new era in tv too. characters weren't one dimensional, not like they were simply good or bad, it wasn't like we rooted for one person and hated the other throughout the show. adding to the multifaceted portrayal of characters, the uncertainty of their faith and the unpredictable nature of the show was just great. it's deep and complicated while being digestible enough to not be overwhelming or preachy.starting from 2011, i fell in love with got and i didn't think that any show will surpass the perfection that it is. i wish i could give it a 10 with all my heart but last season killed this show for me. it was clear from season 7 that things weren't going to be good as it was with grrm but it was still plausible and worth,watching under the circumstances. i knew that season 8 was going to be rushed and irrational in some small ways so i've kept my expectations very low. somehow, benioff and weiss managed to destroy even that as well.last season was not just bad because it wasn't the got we used to watch, it was bad because even gossip girl or pretty little liars had more logic. season 8th's execution was very sloppy and the scriptwriting was lazy as if it was a high school play.benioff and weiss made millions through this show and i find it quite unethical to let their fans down this way. we know that hbo wanted 10 seasons and they said they can finish it in 8 seasons and why is that? just so they can continue their lives with millions in their pockets disregarding everyone that got them to where they are right now?the sloppiness of the last season can even be seen by the simplest mistakes they've made: water bottle, jamie's hand, starbucks cup... come on people you bring dragons to life with maginificent cgi work, i think you can spare 30 sec to delete these things!if you haven't watch this show yet.... just watch it until season 7 and wait for the new books to come out! this way it won't ruin you."

2017-10-26,micharv,"A Story of Dragons, Queens, and Heroes: For Adults",10,"""when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die. there is no middle ground"" (cersei lannister, game of thrones). game of thrones is a spectacular tv show that has unexpectedly drawn me into its complex world, and i highly encourage anyone who enjoys great acting and imaginative story,lines to watch this television show. game of thrones is set in a medieval land where good and evil are at a constant struggle and seven kingdoms fight for control. well- developed characters face harrowing challenges and embark on quests full of death and glory, which categorize game of thrones as an adventure-drama. when i watch an adventure-drama, i expect to see exciting scenes of action unfold and plot lines that develop and take unexpected turns. i want to be engaged in the action as much as the dialogue and expect to see character development throughout. game of thrones is sure to keep you entertained for it includes: stylized action, drama, and fantasy. ""if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention"" (ramsey snow, game of thrones). i rate game of thrones 10 out of 10 stars. my expectations are met each time i watch the show as the plot progresses and action unfolds. main characters face challenging ordeals and often meet their deaths in the vicious, yet realistic, fictional world of westeros. strong violence and upsetting content drives the dark tone of the show, which helps make it an even better drama."
2013-04-23,aron-h-strandberg,Old Memories Re-made,7,"game of thrones is a beginning of an epic journey of series. a story that brings back good old memories. drama, war, magic and epic conversations. i am referring to lord of the rings movies. game of thrones is still not the same, it's something new of it kinds with it's own touch. i love it and it hurts to meet people who haven't open their eyes for game of thrones.i am not a professional reviewer. this is my personal experience and i m not here to sell it, i share if for those who read these review. because you don't want to miss the ""epicness"" of game of thrones. i give it a 10/10.p.s. not a big fan of shivers? then don't watch it..."
2013-05-08,nelsonc51959,Hater's Beware- For the new viewer,3,"this review is not about why this show is so great (see my 10 ranking) but a response to the haters who's comments i can't fully comprehend.if you have never watched this show before and want a true perspective, see below: 1. if you absolutely ""in your bones"" hate fantasy, then this show is not for you. even though this show is 95% about people and their attitudes toward power, government and corruption, there is 5% fantasy. if you can't get beyond the 5% then don't bother.2. yes there is a lot of sex. if this bothers you then don't watch. is the sex always necessary to the plot? no, but it also doesn't derail the plot either. pay tv like hbo has a lot of sex. if you are a puritan don't watch. the story and characters are so good that the ""overdone"" sex scenes are a minor issue.3. yes there is a lot of violence. if this bothers you don't watch. the violence is there to serve the plot. this show is a fantasy but is more heavily based on medieval history. would you be shocked to know that people lived harsh, short and often brutal lives 600 years ago in the real world. if you want pc and sanitary homogenized entertainment, then this is not for you.4. confusing plot, my response is yes and no. yes, there are a lot of characters. yes it is hard to remember all their names. yes it is hard to follow all of the character interactions, what they are trying to do, who that hate, who they love, etc. if you want a tv show that ""spoon feeds"" you an easily digestible plot and a few easy to follow characters, then this is not the show for you. if you (like me) like to be challenged by a tv show and forced to think, analyze, guess and scratch your head, then you will love this show.4. the acting is amazing- i've seen reviews that ""slam"" all of the actors. are all of these people crazy? have they ever seen good acting before? do not believe any of these nay-sayers. amazing acting and amazing casting.5. the writing is excellent- is is shakespeare? no, but its extremely well written as is the source material. since i originally read the books by george r.r. martin, i have tried to read other books by authors like stephen king, dan brown, john grisham, etc. i've found that martin's writing is far superior to these other authors. the show's writers utilize martin's prose and often improve on it.6. stereotyping (typical fantasy stuff)- wow, i can't believe this criticism. well yes.. there are dragons. and yes.. there is magic. this is about a stereotypical as it gets. the entire point of the show is to take your typical ""fantasy"" and turn it upside-down. there are no totally good guys. there are no totally bad guys. someone you hate in season one, you may love by season 3. characters also act like real people. they are fully fleshed and not just cardboard cut out's. i guess if you are looking for stereotypical fantasy, this isn't it, but there is no way this is stereotypical."
2017-11-02,kbjornholt,Love this Show,10,"a world filled with medieval fantasy and historic pretense, game of thrones is a lust filled, war,driven, lord of the rings-esque epic. it follows the standards that accompany the fantasy genre, such as knights, kings and queens, and the presence of dragons. cersei lannister, one of the main characters, is known for saying, ""when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die."" as politics seem to be getting more and more violent, cersei lannister seems to nod towards our violent politics and policies set in place by governments around the world. putting a new twist on the genre, george rr martin manages to take modern problems, such as political corruptness, and incorporate it as the main plot line of the whole show. following 3 main plot lines, you watch as the characters battle for the title of king of the iron throne, the night's watch protects castle black and the rest of westeros, and an estranged princess across the sea slowly builds an army from nothing. game of thrones is a show that exceeds my expectations of what fantasy should be. while it has its fair share of epic battles, knights, and far off lands, it delves so much deeper into the main characters of the show; you feel like you know each character personally, and have struggled along with them. i give game of thrones a a+; it combines all the aspects of a typical fantasy, with a new twist. it is a must see for those interested in this genre."
2019-05-20,firstime911,Is was good until the last 4 episode,1,"the series was excellent all the way until the last 4 episode of season 8. this is totally a kill, the ending was the worst of all"

season 7 9/10
a lot of build up for last season character development is still on track. great build up for the final season
season 8 0/10
absolute garbage, it would have been better had hbo cancelled the show if they wanted to be done so bad. they rinsed their hands for sure. they throw away key characters stories that they have built for years and just end everything abruptly with no explanation. especially since the show is historically known for the amazing detail they put into the show. they went for straight shock factor and that's what they got a whole lot of fans shocked at how perhaps the greatest show ever ended up being the biggest disappointment ever. hbo really let this one get away. i guess the writers were so busy correcting the garbage of star wars episode 8 they put out and focused on episode 9 when they should have been focused on finishing got the right way! somewhere george rr martin is pulling his hair out with what they did to his story. better yet he is probably laughing since he knows how to take time and put a proper ending to his book. he now knows what not to do when he finishes it."
2019-04-29,cutiemii912010,GOAT,6,seriously!!! whatever i'll say about this show has already been said....no doubt the best show in television history. i'm gonna watch it all over again from season 1. i don't want it to end 😔
2019-04-29,tedhemberger-415-310,I started watching game of thrones two weeks ago.,10,"this episode is by far the best episode created.miguel sapochnik did an amazing job.arya came through on the clutch like she should have and deserved to.spoiled watching this show. my filmmaker wife turned me onto it and it's inspirational in so many ways as a filmmaker myself to continue forward in our industry here on imdb to change and grow into what i want to be.thank you miguel. thank you db wiese. and thank you got.my perspective on the way shows are done has changed after watching what can be accomplished when thousands of crew members get together in a foreign country and work 17 hour days to create something worth watching.it took me 8 years to watch this show. now i can't binge watch to see the demise of circe and have to wait like everyone else. i think that is why shows were made.i anticipate next sunday like you'd anticipate the super bowl.keep killing it ""best show in the world"" keep killing it."
2013-05-18,onewhosewordsrweapons,Quick Review - No spoilers,1,"i held out on game of thrones for quite some time for a few reasons..if i had read the novels , i most likely wouldn't have (to be completely honest , medieval fantasy fiction has never really been my thing).. george rr martin may have just changed all of that... the show has stricken a chord with some folks, which just lends it even more credibility if you ask me..it is brutal. beastly . revolting. disgusting and heartbreaking. it's also beautiful , spirited, uplifting, soulful and inspirational..watching it is an experience, one that seems to resonate. this show does , in a way, what breaking bad is also doing for me - engaging me in such a way that i revel in what is my own sense of what it is to be human..and needless to say, i am entirely invested in the characters - which leaves me even further in suspense, as nobody is safe!the casting team and the acting crew also deserve props for this one as well.. with the exception of just a few independent scenes , the acting is superb..it would really easy to chew up the scenery , yet they walk the line extremely well. the production is , of course, outstanding. everything from costume design to the invention of the languages used was well prepared and executed brilliantly. it is a bit ironic to think of how skeptical i was of the show , given my initial reluctance to sit down and watch it, and now, how much i enjoy it . matter of fact, i don't think i could trust a person who has watched three episodes and does't thoroughly enjoy it!"
2019-05-07,mouhamedlaminos,First impressions aren't everything,9,while it starts off excellent and full of potential it quickly loses steam due to some lazy derivative writing would recommend it but there are better fantasy alternatives out there however i'll compliment the great acting and production values
2019-05-25,bajraktarifatjon,Why?,10,"i don't understand everyone who is hating on s08. was it worse than the other ones? probably. but they had so much storyline to cramp into 6 episodes and i think they did a pretty good job at it. yes, it would've been much better had we had a s09 or even a s10 just so that they can explain a lot of plot holes. but come, i see people rating the show a 1 just because they don't like how it ended and honestly, no offense to anyone, but that's just dumb. i'm not saying you don't get to express your opinions, just try to look at it in a more objective way than just what you think would've been best. honestly, you lot can argue as much as you want, but game of thrones is still the greatest show ever made."
2019-06-17,metallicaterina,Such a shame,10,"great series up to 5th season where it was going along with the books. worst ending ever. we had so many expectations, the story was so rich with so many opportunities to evolve but clearly the writers were not skilled. they managed to destroy the whole story. if i knew that it was going to be such a disappointment i wouldn't start watching it in the first place."
2019-05-13,abouhiedeb1999201,Worst episode in all the show from beginning,10,they have corrupted the while idea of the game of thrones with this episode
2013-05-30,psaikke,The 3rd season is amazing!,1,"i'm a big fan of the show. after the phenomenal 1st season i went to the library and borrowed the first four books and started reading them. i must say that martin's way of structuring the story and the amount of characters makes the reading quite difficult. somewhere in the middle of the fourth book i gave up and decided to watch the show first. the second season was great, although mildly slow,paced. enjoyed the slowly increasing supernatural elements like lady melisandre's magic, the horrible walking dead and, of course, the dragons. the last two episodes were action-packed and left me yearning for the next season. now i'm watching the 3rd season only one day behind the original showings in the us and i must say that it is breath-taking! the action, the characters, the pure evilness of the characters, the fantastic elements, the effects and settings.. the sinister dialogs (especially tywin's ""heart-warming"" moments with his children tyrion and cersei), ahhhh, this is something never seen on tv. having read so far, i think i know what is happening in the last two episodes of this season, and without spoiling anything i can say that the viewers will be stuttering! can't wait to see how the story continues on the screen. extraordinary work, hbo!"
2019-05-20,tallerthanyoutoo,"Details details details details details, oh sh** we only have 6 episodes left ummmmm just write something down! What should we write? I don't care just write it!",7,"so season 1,5 were very detailed and dragged on and on and on! almost too long! but, it provided a very well detailed story for fans to enjoy! characters decisions had consequences and their deaths had meaning! you didn't know if someone was going to live or die because no one was safe! no one wore ""plot armor"" season 6 was fantastic still but seamed a little rushed things happened rather fast but they were still detailed enough to the point of realism. the characters that were introduced and the ones we said goodbye to had weight! season 7 was like a gift to the fans! everything that you wanted to happen happened! but it was almost too much of what we wanted! and it all happened too fast! in past seasons if someone said, i'm going to this place, it would take a few episodes for them to get there and someone probably died along the way! in season 7 someone would say i'm gonna go here and then in the next scene they where there as though no time passed at all! season 8 sooooooooooo much was forced! where was the build up? there was none! we here was the development! there was none! it was just pay off! but the pay off fell flat because there was no build up to it! there were two or three deaths that had meaning in this season and only one of them that i wouldn't have changed anything about! all the other deaths just happened! that is really the only way i can describe it! they just happened! there was no weight to them, no feeling of dread, no sorry! they just died! so idk why there wasn't another season really develop what happened, or even just a few more episodes! but honestly i went from this being my favorite show to not really being able to recommend it to anyone. this show is the epitome of shows that just don't know how to write a good ending."
2019-05-22,agiorgos86,Season 8 killed the show,10,"you would have the best tv show if it wasn't for season 8. some episodes were amazing like ""rains of castamere"" ""the door"" ""dragon stone"" ""hardhome"" and many more. and then season 8 begun. you built night king to be soo powerful and you kill him off in one episode with arya to be an assassin???? and if that wasn't enough you turn dany into a mad queen maybe female hitler but ok aegon would save the day. and when the time comes you say ""hey you know what aegon is a nobody we'll just exile him to castle black and without need for night watch to exist"". the whole aegon thing building up was for nothing. and then at the ""council"" you discover democracy in a show that was all about conspiracy, murders, stubbing in the back making the finale disproofing what has been done. good job on disappointing everyone game of thrones."
2019-05-20,keshanwasala,Disappointing!!,1,"i wish night king killed them all and rule the westeros, that would be a better ending than this disappointing!!"
2013-06-13,thekingoftheworthless,The Game of Porcelain Thrones (S1-3),10,"art thrives on limitations, or it can also thrive on big budgets. but i have never seen art push so far to these two extremes that it becomes an overdone and overbearing nightmare that never gets to the point. it's a chess game that never ends. i thought law and order was dull.i truly believe that this book series would work better as films, because cuts would be needed, and believe me, i would cut out a lot of scenes in the hbo series. hell, i'd cut characters out altogether, rob and arya stark, and the other stark kid who has noodles for legs, and others. you can retire these characters with no warning right now and i would not have caught on. until they do something important, i won't care. sorry, mother of dragons.this show takes itself too seriously that there gray characters and gray persona's matches there gray on gray suits and landscapes, even when you see red and gold, its lies. it's hard to care about the kings slayer when the biggest things he has done in the series is bang his sister, pushed a kid out a high window and had his stranger hand chopped off. even though there are a few scenes with him after that which seems to have a potential to launch into something interesting, if not good. whether they use this to its advantage or not, remains to be seen, most likely not.the only character that stands out in anyway is the dwarf character. he is not a good character, but he is the only hint of a character we have.there are too many characters in this story, even for tv show standards.there are 32 maine characters alone!!! (one or two of them being killed off, even so...)no wonder the show has weak focus. there is simply not enough screen time for any of the them, which makes you forget about most of them as soon as they leave. and i love how they just keep adding new characters, because that is exactly what the ultimate solution is, right? reminds me of no country for old men.this show needs to learn to leave well enough alone, when to not drag and when to move on, learn to be comfortable with edit, and being serious and gray does not make this show epic or deep, let alone smart, it is just underwhelming. the walking dead isn't this serious.i'll still watch got like a sports fan who still sticks with their bad team, but i'm hoping as the show goes on, it will undo all the issues i have had and finally make a story that is worth a damn. put you pieces where they need to be and stop stalling.i just saw season three episode nine, and congrats, my friend, you have actually made me care about people in a scene, but in the most basic and cheap way possible. its never comfortable for anyone to watch anyone get an abortion in that fashion, but if screwing someone or getting killed is your only wow moment these characters ever get, then stop writing and find a different hobby."

2013-06-24,rockincd,Best TV Show Ever!,9,"i have been watching the tube since they were small, round and black & white back in the early '50s and game of thrones is the best production i have ever seen , by a wide margin. everything about the show is off the charts from the writing and acting, to the sets, costumes and locations this show just plain keeps you on the edge of seat for the whole time you are watching. and, then you can't wait for the next episode. fabulous storytelling a tour de force in the arts. this is must see tv and tv at its best. you used to have to go to the movies to an ""a"" movie at that to come anywhere close to the quality of game of thrones. this masterpiece of art touches the viewer's emotions in deep places and that is what great performing arts is all about. you either love of hate these characters who are brought to life so vividly by the actors and writers and directors. and, what is very interesting is you see the characters evolve before your eyes and your feelings toward them change as the tug and pull and rejection and revulsion work their way into your consciousness. viewers feel passionately about game of thrones. i can't wait for next season."
2014-06-17,tirthacr7,"A visual spectacle, with a gripping storytelling of the bloody wars of WESTEROS.",1,"perhaps the most complete comprehensive and epic narrative in the history of television. adapted from george r.r. martin's ""a song of ice and fire"" the series takes us through to the land of westeros where medieval feudalism and misguided chivalry exist in tandem, where five major families fight for the control of the ""iron throne"". filled with honor and betrayal, complete with dragons to zombies, this show promises to get better even more. when king robert comes all the way to the north- the ancient kingdom of the starks to seek help from his best mate ned stark, the honorable lord decides to comply. the queen is a lannister- the villainous among the great families. elsewhere the remaining siblings of the deposed targaryens are also preparing to get their kingdom back. in this whirlwind of events starts the first episode. truly speaking its very hard to leave your seat from then on. after the sopranos' comes another masterpiece from hbo. not seen it yet- well frankly you're really something. coz' its simply the best."

2013-06-27,peterbdesigner,Over Rated,10,"after all the hype i was expecting much better from this series.. the story is slow and episodes can pass without anything happening at all.. characters invite you to like them and then they do something stupid or they die.. i find it impossible to become emotionally attached to anyones character ( by that i mean i don't know who to support or believe in because they usually die within a few episodes of becoming central to the plot).. its just a very frustrating series and seems to be mindlessly continuing without any real method.. overall, 6/10 may be harsh.. acting is great and set is even better.. but the average rating (9.4/10) is simply not right.."
2019-06-26,didozizoo92,Disastrous Ending,7,"it seems like a ten years child wrote this ending,where all his loved characters are kept safe"
2014-02-05,sweetey15,A Brilliant Graphic Drama,5,"this is an excellent drama show that i would recommend to everyone who can handle it's explicit content. game of thrones is produced by hbo so this should be expected. however, despite it's explicit content it is still an outstanding drama show. game of thrones is a series that requires patience when it comes to plot development, despite this the show can easily hook you with cliffhangers and brilliant acting. the effort and detail put into this show visually really pays out creating a show that feels real, gripping and enthralling. this show is centred around the conflicts and interactions between the many houses in westeros. centering around secrets and betrayal, war and family,ties, this show is more than just a fantasy series. the highlight of this show is the interactions between it's many characters and the complexity of the plot. because of this complexity keeping up with plot lines and characters can often get confusing, but eventually things begin to work themselves out as you watch more. i enjoy how well the writers have adapted the novels, even with the plot lines differing in minor ways. this however, is mainly to help with the budget and also to help out the viewer since there are even more characters in the books which, if added, would likely confuse the already sprawling and complex storyline. all in all game of thrones is a series i highly recommend to anyone who likes a brilliant plot, fantastic actors and great writing."

2019-05-13,csb1041,Season 8 - Not Good!,10,game of thrones is a classic example of how a single season can make users lose interest in the show. season 8 has good writing and exceptional visuals but there was too much unnecessary content in the middle and too much fan servicing.
2019-05-20,oalmahri,Still by far the best TV show ever,9,"i know that so many people wouldn't agree especially if you just watched season 8 , however my judgement is based on a full show with everything brought to us in it. we had lived together with the show for almost 10 years and i have been extremely enjoying every minute of it.
the massive production is something that you can't get over it and will be very hard to beat it in the future.
it could be better i agree , but what we have seen is tv masterpiece and we were lucky that it was our generation .thank you all for the efforts and for the show."

2015-11-09,theamazingbeeford,"""Winter is coming""",10,"the hbo masterpiece, game of thrones, is truly one of the greatest shows that has ever been created. set in the fantasy world of westeros, got presents audiences with a very mature and unpredictable story about war, politics, family, and death.,pros: the story of this show is best of any show that i've seen. the main plot is intense, interesting, and ever evolving. the show features many great and memorable characters (some you will love, and rest you will hate). the lives and deaths of many of the characters are very emotional and deep. the show is incredibly unpredictable, with many unexpected twists and turns. got makes excellent use of its hbo budget, featuring set pieces and cg that rival many hollywood movies. the cinematography is absolute excellent and visually appealing. acting is fantastic and the show paces very well. you do not need to have read the books or be a fantasy nerd to enjoy this amazing series. the amazing story, great characters, and beautiful cinematography make this one of the greatest shows ever created.-cons: this series is not for the faint of heart, as it contains brutal violence and graphic nudity. i wouldn't recommend this show to anybody under the age of 18 as it is an adult oriented show. this is not really a bad thing, but it does put restrictions on those who can watch it. the show contains no significant flaws other than the occasional slow episode (which is expected from time to time).i would give a got a solid 10/10 as it is indeed a masterpiece that all tv watchers should watch, regardless of what genre they prefer."
2014-02-10,archmister,An overall brilliant show that keeps to the book!,10,"game of thrones is a must see for fans of all genres, especially those of fantasy, adventure and well directed dramas. if you are a fan of titles such as lord of the rings or spartacus then i would recommend for you to watch this even more as it is essentially a mix between the two just with more drama and even better written dialog.the show contains a great amount of incredible acting from new actors and ones you may have already heard of. their performance however is greatly aided by the fantastic writers who make the show very excitable and thrilling.so grab your popcorn and beverage friends as you get ready to watch one of the best shows ever to be produced and shown on television."
2014-01-12,mp_planitzer,Game of Thrones is a masterpiece,10,"great series. better late than never! a series which will be released in,depth of all individuals and one for an identification of a middle age universe.i love how the author takes you along on a long unpredictable journey into the magical universe where the battle against good and evil plays a large rolegame of thrones beats all the movies and all series!to call it a series is almost a shame because it feels like a long incredibly good movie.i am amazed almost in love."

2015-11-04,xxragnarokxx,Wow... Just wow...,10,"this is my first review on imdb and i was honestly so disgusted by this ""adaptation"" that i had to write this just to let out some steam. apologize in advance if it's a bit 'ranty' and 'rambley'first let me say, obviously, that i am a fan of the books. i actually had never read them until recently, and with all the hype for years about the show i figured i'd finally see what all the fuss was about. but i had to read the source material first; like i said, love the books. martin has built a kind of tolkienesque world more at a human level with a dark and black/white/gray grittiness you normally get from something by joe abercrombie or mark lawrence. but hey, not talking about the book here, talking about the ""show"".like i said, i was super excited to watch this show. i had heard it was very faithful to the books and that the acting was amazing and the effects over the top and it was the second,coming-of-the-lord- of- shows and yadda yadda, it's amazing, right? as i read certain scenes in the books: such as danny going through the house of the undying, or lord beric fighting clegane with a flaming sword i couldn't help but to imagine the bad-assery in my head and couldn't wait to see it on screen. yet after watching a few episodes i just had to say, wtf! okay, the wights and others looked amazing and i was very excited from the get-go, (not necessarily the exact adaptation of the book but artistic licence is okay sometimes). awesome way to start off the show! aaaaand that was about the only great thing i found about this over-blown, terribly acted, big budgeted, softcore-porn pos. words cannot describe how utterly disappointing and just plain gross this show is. the acting is good by a few characters, i'm a big sean bean fan and couldn't have imagined a better eddard stark and most of the characters look faithful enough and close to what i imagined so that's fine. (jon snow though -_- looks like he should be lead singing in one direction, not a bad-ass wight slaying black brother that can ride for days with a seeping arrow wound. but i digress...) anyways most look great until they open their mouths... did i say terrible acting? well i'll say it again, the acting mostly is on par with one of those monthly syfy exclusives (sharknado anyone?)and i know that adaptations rarely if ever stay %100 true to the source but man this is taking it to another level. things they change just for the hell of it make me wonder if they even read the books. arya being good at shooting a bow from the start for example, when the arya from the book mentioned many times how she wished she could learn to shoot. what reason was there to change that?? just a small example, but the show is riddled with the small slaps in the face like this so you get my point. not only these small changes but huge story altering changes as well. i understand sometimes budgetary issues get in the way of certain scenes but for the love of god don't puss out and re-wright everything just for the seeming what-the-hell of it. oh and i hear they're bringing ned back to life in season 6, nice job fellas! haven't seen writing this good since my mother used to force me to watch guiding light as a child.i won't go into detail about every little thing that disappointed me about this show because i would be writing all night and no one wants to read a hundred page rant. i just think that this show gets waaaaayyy too much credit and acclaim.i'll finish by saying: if you like the books, avoid this one. ever read eragon? ever watched that movie? well that was pulp fiction and lord of the rings and the godfather compared to this utter garbage."
2013-07-31,artur-witczak,"Very nice production, I watched every episode with pleasure, BUT...",10,"it will be more a comment than a review , lots of information can be found, also recommendation's. but... i read every book before - 1 season was almost perfect - in mater of keeping script accurate to story from book. second should be a warning sign for everybody ""watch out ! i'm starting to be a different story"" third season was a nail to the coffin - in the middle, about episode 5 or 6 i start to suspect that elvis presley with yeti will jump out from the next corner. maybe we will see yoda or lord wader in this production soon.i don't want to spoil anything so no further details. i understand the needs of some extra sub stories to build tension or explain some more complicated trails but making complete fiction is a different story.i strongly recommend to everybody - read the book carefully - it's worth it ! you will discover a different , and amazing story.what about hbo production - really good when we are talking about tv entertainment. i watch every episode and i enjoy it. ( apart of script- to-book accuracy )"

2016-01-22,priyanshrastogi54,I would rate it 20 out of 10 if I could.,6,"game of thrones is the best tv series till date. it is the best thing ever happened to the television. it has everything fantasy, horror, action, advanture, dragons, sexual content, love. i started watching this tv series last month. it had characters like ned stark, khal drogo. when they died i felt like how can they die? they were the most effective characters in season one. and after the death of robb stark and his mother i don't think any of the character is safe. they can kill anyone at anytime. no matter how effective character is that. the suspense is increasing as time is passing. the white walkers, one of the best mystery creatures i have ever watched. it was the last episode of season 5 and they killed jon snow. like seriously. he was the most focused character in season 4 and 5. after watching that now i can't wait for season 6. who will get the throne khaleesi or house of starks (jon snow, bran stark and arya stark) or the lannisters or the white walkers. waiting for season 6 dreadfully."

2015-06-21,terrymel-762-761772,A lot of wind but no direction,10,"i tried many times watching this series but always found the first episode so tedious that i kept giving up. then i found myself with a lot of dead time at a job once and ploughed through the first 3 series thanks to the blessing of fast forwarding. so yes, the production is epic and the scenery stunning and some characters are worth following.but the plot devices are so clumsy it is painful! the main beef i have is with the military campaigns that eat up hours of the story but never comes to fruition. instead they peter out in one quick assassination or a quick battle and the whole thing is forgotten. we then follow another campaign for hours that ends up in a dead end with no advancement to the story at all. also there is way too much sex and sadism, but apparently people like that in their series. i'm not anti,sex, i just like the plots of adventure movies to get out of the bedroom from time to time, although that has slowly been phased out through seasons 4 and 5. the concept is great and as i said the production value is amazing but there is no satisfaction to be had at any point. for me story telling is about watching heroes (sometimes flawed ones), overcome odds to achieve something that changes things for the better at some point. but there is little of that if none at all. all we get is series of overlong cat-fights, doomed campaigns and pointless travels that achieve nothing in terms of viewer satisfaction. killing off main character is all well and good as a shock tactic but it looses its impact if it happens every 2 minutes and we are left with no-one to root for, and then what's the point of watching. then it just becomes cinematic masturbation of seeing how depraved people can be and how grand the scenery can be. but as i said all this without the human element is utterly pointless."
2019-04-29,mohamed_aiad,Don't Underestimating Assassin,9,"a lot of people says that the night king shouldn't die easy like that as arya killed him, but i think there is a lots of events that creators of series want us to see how powerful she is (arya) after years of trainings sh became a complete badass assassin that mastering all sorts of disguise, sneaking and swinging sword techniques, so all she need is to know where the night king is and the killing thing is here job. finally i saw the killing of night king scene is very logical to me."

""hi, i'm a white male, and got is the best thing ever since ever.""i give the story 10 of 10, the acting 10 of 10. what ruins this show is the editing. how many times must i pause and explain to other watchers what is happening? additionally, how long do you have to make them wait to buy in to caring about one character or another? but not to worry, if you are about the tune out, boobs. watch because boobs. i get the context and need for the nudity and sex and rape...but it must support the story. if it doesn't it is just porn. and there is nothing wrong with porn, but i am not necessarily sitting down to watch got to get off. i am watching for a good story. too much of this sexual content essentially spoils the story for me. but, i am not a white male. if i was, i might welcome the sexual interludes even though they do not enhance the story. it would be the same to me as including random fight scenes with no explanation, dialogue with no meaning, or characters constantly introduced and then never seen again. where's the substance? oh, right, its hidden behind that boob.sorry,-just misses the mark. too bad. i'd rather read it now."
2013-09-01,jordan-tyndall,Nothing Quiet Like It,1,"game of thrones can't truly be placed into any specific category due to its incredibly organic stile of story telling.when you watch movies, such as lord of the rings or the hobbit(yes i understand that they are both tolkienian), you know which characters have got ""invisible plot shields"" which make them impervious the lethal danger, yes frodo gets stabbed and poisoned by the morgul,blade but that all works out for him fine in the end.in game of thrones characters are treated as people and don't get give these mysterious powers to evade death by pure fluke. you will form emotional bonds with the characters and each time a character is killed of it just makes you become more and more connected with the game of thrones universe.game of thrones also probably has some of the strongest characters in books and movies alike because you can really elaborate on you feelings about a character and 2 people may have interpreted a characters actions differently depending on the persons outlook.this is a very mature show and should be treated as such so if you just want something at and listen to as your eyes glaze over while playing a video game or reading a book then this is not for you. in order to really appreciate the depth of the series you need to pay attention to the context because if you miss a bit you may loose track of the entire series or even show as a whole.the only thing which i can say that some users may not like is the large amount of graphic sex and nudity in the series, but that isn't anything to demote it for, just be warned not to watch it in front of children.to conclude, game of thrones is a fantastic tv show if you are watching it and not just using it for white noise. i would wholeheartedly recommend game of thrones as long as you are mature and over the age of 14."
2013-09-02,naseko,"Good, but I'm looking for perfection",9,"i'm a big fan of the work, read all the books of a song of ice and fire and come here to make a brief review of what i think of the series. the first season was very good (maybe because i had not read the book and everything was new), but from there, the producers began to change and omit details not so important, but with no need. the actors and scenery were well chosen, i feel the show when i'm reading the book and vice versa.although the median score, the work deserves a production height, the height on a budget, of course this show was a good start, but i cheer that it won't be the definitive work.in short, 10 for the books, 7 for the show."
2019-05-20,khalid_0054,Should be 10 but season 8 ruined it all,10,"the whole serious is marvelous, from acting (except some protagonists) to especially the music and visuals. unfortunately, d&d ruined this masterpiece. i can't downgrade the rating below 9 because of the last season only, i feel like not doing justice for the whole series, especially the first 5 seasons. thus, for me 9 is a fair score despite giving the last season 3/10."

2015-09-29,enesburaksenel,HBO knows it's job,10,"game of thrones is the best hbo show ı have ever seen. george has created a beautiful world. dan and david has adopted the story to small screen very nicely. show has many lovable and hateble characters. it has the best intro i have ever seen. it has nice soundtracks. acting is a class. show is very graphic if you are not good at watching gory scenes like oberyn's death then i don't recommend this show to you. i̇f you like movies like lord of the rings then there is no doubt that you will love this show. first season : it is the most violent one but the show is very complex and you can't fully understand the show without knowing their names second season: i̇t is the worst season but it is still great. many remember able moments like the battle of the black water third season: season that we lost starks many great moments like the red wedding fourth season: the best season many great moments like tyrion's trial, the red viper vs. the mountain, defending the wall and oberyn's every single scene. fifth season:the one with the highest budget many memorable mentions like white walkers sequence, fighting pit scene, meryn trant's death and jon's after all my rating for got is 10/10"
2019-05-30,wtdogg,Unmatched,1,"amazing series and unmatched in the world when it comes to quality of acting, production, writing, etc, etc. believe the hype. opinion: if i had stopped watching entirely after s8e3, i would've been happier. the final season is top notch in quality of everything except writing. they were obviously rushed to get the series to a conclusion with little to no source material, and the dialogue and plot development suffers greatly in s8. the final twists would've been more acceptable and understandable if it had been longer and more fleshed out. instead this epic saga concludes with a lot of unhappy superfans."
2019-05-20,markusm-793-558026,Disaster !,7,last episode ruin the whole series.. who wrote this episode is so stupid and diabolic..
2018-05-01,marypapadr,My initial rating was a solid 10,10,"my initial rating was a solid 10, but while watching seasons 5,7 i was tempted to lower my rating even more. i was a fan of the show, before i was a fan of the books, but i fell in love with the beautiful writing of george rr martin. even in a world of dragons and blood magic, there is realism that can be found in the story. there are no ""bigger than life"" characters, but instead flawed human beings that you can actually empathy with.this is why, when i was seeing all the opportunities the show runners missed or choose to miss and some of martin's cleverly crafted storylines turned to failures (see dorne, the greyjoys and even daenerys character development at times) i was disappointed to say the least. non the less game of thrones is an excellent show. the cinematography, special effects and direction are breathtaking at times (see battle of the bastards episode) as a lot of people have pointed out before me. i understand the difficulty of transferring martin's immense fictional world to screen and at this point i have chosen to separate the show from the books (as the show runners clearly intend) and regard them as two totally different things. if anyone misses the suspense of earlier seasons, i recommend reading the books. they are about 1000 pages each, but we all have to wait until 2019 anyway and winter is coming."

2021-07-12,leomags,One of the Best I ever watched,10,"this show got me stuck on my new tv, i ask myself why i never watched it before, but i'm glad i finished in one week because if i had to wait every week one episode to drop i'd die...everything is so great, the performances, drama, violence, cgi, scripts everything, i really loving watching and i hope to watch more of them, thanks."
2020-06-15,becky_cutcliffe,Absolute brilliance,1,"while i worried that the torture would be too much for me to handle (i have a weak stomach for that!), i'm so glad i pushed through! yes, it's quite gruesome and horrible at times, but the story is so engaging and detailed and unique! will definitely watch again."
2019-05-14,miguel_garcia010,Season 8... why?,1,"i enjoyed season 1,7 very much. i became a true got fan. almost every episode i was stunned and thrilled to see more. and i couldnt wait to see the next episode. that all changed when i saw season 8zi think that the production team didnt have the financial possibilities to make season 8 better. it seems that they want to put an end to it quickly.
scenes are shortened and important moments are omitted.i'm sure season 8 is a real flop
i expected so much more."
2019-05-20,jd221331,What the sh....,4,all the seasons build up for what?! what was all the prophecies for? nothing. they lied to you. sign the petition. terrible last season.
2013-10-13,cameronporter95,The Best,10,"how is this show not number one. i mean i'm a massive fan of breaking bad. but game of thrones is on a completely different level to any other show out there. including breaking bad. it has proper developing and unfolding story lines that are planned out from the beginning. it's unbelievably gritty and the character development is astonishing. the characters are real and you feel real emotion when something happens to one of them. game of thrones treads where no other show ever has, it's full of twists and it lulls you into a false sense of security before stabbing you in the back. you really have no idea what will happen, and it's the unpredictability combined with the shear boldness that makes this show so much better that any other. where other shows have main characters that you know won't die because that would be the end of the show, game of thrones doesn't have any one main character. so they could do anything."
2019-05-16,sasuke_italy,Trash ending,1,"dumb and dumber ruined the whole series in only 1 season, that's a great achievement.."
2014-06-11,debater-mouse,Amazing Show!,1,"this is the best show on tv today. it may be the best show in the history of tv series'. it is definitely not for everyone. the sexual content and violence alone will turn a lot of people away. if you can handle this part then you're in luck. get ready to go on a thrill ride. emotional, exciting, intelligent and tragic. this show really has it all. one warning is not to fall too much in love with any particular character or dynamic. nobody is safe when playing the game of thrones. and with a tag line like ""all men must die"", well you get the picture by now. amazing actors, amazing sets, amazing filming locations. this show is...amazing. enjoy!"
2015-05-08,yagmurkagan,"Born a king, raised a prince, dead as a poor guy (possibly)",1,"first of all, i don't say this show sucks, but it sucks hard comparing to the books.this show began with a great potential, until they started to be unloyal to the book series.i personally think that the relations, wars, etc. are well told in the books, however, they decided to change these in the tv series (which i don't know why), they started by not even mentioning really important parts, they also started creating new stories which are stupid comparing to the ones within the book. and the new story they created is really became dumb.i cannot believe how george martin let them to ruin a masterpiece like this.all i ever wonder about this show is why did they decide to ruin this story by changing it this much (and changing it with untalented scenario writing), instead of writing/creating a new story,not related to got.my beliefs for this series are similar to peter jackson's hobbit trilogy, which was ruined in a similar way. those movies were not bad either, but jackson changed the story too much, and it led me to think the same , why ruin this one and not create a new goddamn story not related to hobbit?i simply cannot understand. if they stood loyal to the books in got (i admit it's impossible to stay loyal %100, but i'd expect at least not changing the story), it'd be a great, i mean really great show.but now, it has become only a ""good show""."

2013-12-08,rob_donia,Wow,3,"i am not a fan of this genres or dramatic tv shows in general but after the recommendations of few friends and the imdb user review rating for this show, i thought to myself, well, i should sit down and watch at least 1 episode and boy was i glad i did.i went through 3 seasons in a couple of weeks and i am left speechless, blown away, hocked , more like addicted, crazily in love, and can't wait for season 4 to start.while it is true that few actors, maybe one or two, are a little wooden in their acting range that did not put a dint in the overall experience watching this series. by far and by any account and measurement this tv show is absolutely the best thing to ever make it on tv. i just finished the third series last night so i am still shocked by you know what....."

2019-01-06,mojibafshar,NOT that much BIG and EXCITING,10,"50% of people watch this title because of the recommendation of the first 50%! in iran, 90% of people watch and recommend this title because of sex senses and i'm sure about this one. i'm living with them trust me! this title is relying on its sex senses to keep the audience motivated. full of negative points such as people behave like lying, flattering, drinking too much, treason, pay attention to pleasure houses, marching an army not just because of the sake of realms etc... okay fine, all of these are correct on that specific era but there was honor too and unfortunately, i don't see that too much!
in the end, i have to say this title is not that big and exciting that the world says but it's worth to watch."

2013-12-21,jagutivera,outstanding series!,10,"game of thrones is an epic medieval show, that is, from the looks of it, had a big budget that is utilized nicely and well executed. and takes a lot of time, but that's reasonable. also, it is based on a series of books. although, i admit that i haven't read the books yet, but if this is really based on the book, i can imagine that the book is also terrific. about the budget that i mentioned above? let's talk about that.plot: well, the plot is based on the book, and it's a story about political control and power, hence the name of the show. now this is where the show shines; there are lots of unexpected turn of events and twists that will jump at you. even the main character could die, or the least unexpected one could die all of a sudden. because of that, you will never know who are the protagonists on this show. unlike the other shows, the protagonists survives, fights the antagonists, wins and saves the day. this show isn't like that.props/materials: you can see that they really had spent the budget on the props and decors that well. they're really decent. their props had a simple, if not, nice design. like the tents in tywin lannister's camp, decorations in the king's landing castle, their weapons. not to mention the needed extras. that would take a lot of work and budget. soundtrack: orchestrated medieval soundtracks. while they're not much significant in the middle of the show for me, i really love the music on the opening intro. actors: great acting, and you never see someone who puts their head or looks in the places that they weren't meant to, and has a pale acting. i didn't see anyone that look liked they were struggling with acting. characters: i haven't read the book yet as i said above, so i'm not sure that the personalities of the characters are different apart from the book. but chances are that they are in their same qualities and background when compared to the book. this show has lots of characters that you'd love to hate, you'd love plainly. but great, nonetheless. effects: the opening title is astounding, that it looks like it's also an intro from a blizzard/old school age of empires strategies game. while effects aren't much that present in this show, they're lifelike and well looking. two examples are daenerys' dragons and the blizzard behind the icy wall.overall: the tension in seasons increases as the plot passes. this is an example of a show that has a big budget and it was used well. and also, the reason while they only film 10 episodes per season and why they take much time. it's quality is very high that it looks like you're not watching a tv show but a movie instead. for those who are going to start in season 1, it might seem boring, weak and chaotic at first, you might have no clue what is going on in the first place. by the time you start season 2, it's different. i really like this show because it somewhat depicts the system and the society in the medieval times."
2019-05-14,nick-sorrells,Worst final season of any series I've watched,1,they take every promising storyline and drives it into the ground in the last few episodes

2018-10-23,stuart-betts,Dull,2,"i gave up on episode five as i found myself bored stupid. i love fantasy, but this so called epic was as captivating as a watching as watching a magnolia wall dry. two dimensional characters, dull script and sean bean proving again he can't act."
2021-08-23,whiskyfeet,Shame it ended after 4 seasons.,1,"i give it a star for each season it had.i heard hbo wanted it to go for 10 seasons so they could wrap up all of the characters in a fashionable way. still, four seasons was probably smart, you never want to overstay your welcome i suppose."
2020-08-27,antonkocharyan,One of the best series of all-time.,10,"i totally enjoyed the show. however i was a little disappointed that jon had to join the night's watch again at the end, but then i realized that king bran did what had to be done , give justice to the people of the six kingdoms. without justice, as we know there's no peace. on the other hand, i didn't expect bran to become a king at all, but it was a good surprise from the writers of the show.
and yeah - i loved how drogon didn't kill jon. my opinion is that he recognized a targaryen in him - so he burnt the iron throne instead - the real reason for people killing each other. a great ending of a great show."
2014-07-20,sami-kiiskinen,Awful show,10,"i watched the 1st episode from season 1 and i have to say i'm disappointed. after the 1st episode i already know this show doesn't have anything to offer for me. so i won't be wasting my time.i love fantasy genre in general. i have my standards and habits. i was almost shocked when i saw how this series is riding with nudity. breasts visible all the time, naked women being toys for the guys. this was awful. i don't mind watching brutal scenes every now and then but i just can't see any reason why there has to be so much nudity.good fantasy story rides on with it's good script and not with nudity. this series is more bold and the beautiful series with soft porn scenes.tl;dr waste of time."
2019-04-29,milarsen07,A masterpiece,1,a show is only as good as its writing and direction. game of thrones masters both and only gets better by the seasons.
2016-04-12,dineshbansal007,Best Show Ever,10,"i don't believe there has ever been anything like 'game of thrones' on tv. the sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. the actors (and i mean really all the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make,up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make television-history. and the writing is just phenomenal.there have been a couple of great tv-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale and quality, 'game of thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. a joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – television. 10 stars out of 10."

2014-02-17,djfishr,Great Series,10,"game of thrones is a great series to follow up, specially when it highlights the importance of our past and history. the character engage and show how the settlement and growth of the ion throne is caught. the lifestyle stands in the evolution. the royalty of the movie is well done how it shows the social stratification. at the end my rating is 10/10 and would tell the director and actors to keep up the good work from canada. the other thing i would like to point out is however game of throne does it , they make the series end with this feeling of you wanting to watch and want to wonder what will happen the episode after. they should correlate the kings like khalisi with joffrey. seriously jeffrey is such an character, which you really want to beat up and hate. they should've not killed the lord at the beginning because the lord dragged me to watch this movie. that scene was not fair at all. and also the son of the lord and the wife of the lord. they should've kept creating more troops and army to takeover and make the lanisters suffer. i really wonder which time period does this movie aim at, and also they should really have a better sense of geography. locations are very important, and that is barely shown in the movie. the movements are very important. and it's very hard to find out.thanksgreat series to watch. one of my favourites."
2017-05-15,ciaran16,Simply the Best,2,"game of thrones is simply the best television show of it's genre. it never disappoints and has a large cast of actors who are perfect for their roles. this is my individual opinion but i would highly suggest watching it. i never thought i would enjoy it as much as i have but that's because game of thrones delivers on a great story, compelling characters and a vast world which was created by george rr martin."
2014-04-09,vavavoom_14,Something for everyone.,1,"i didn't think i would be such a fan of this series because i'm not big on fantasy. but game of thrones has it all.epic drama epic fights epic story linesepic back,stories (without having to do flashbacks) epic characters brilliant humour and epic sex.it takes a while to get into because there are literally hundreds of characters that get introduced, but they all serve an entertaining and significant purpose until they eventually die an incredible death. it's easily one of the best shows on television at the moment, because it has something for everyone, and did i mention it's rather epic? just don't watch it with your kids."
2019-01-16,keithhiger,Cant stop watching,10,i watched nearly half a seasoned straight until 5 am simply because i could not stop.
2015-06-14,philosoraptor1,"Complicated, not enough dragon action",10,"game of thrones is well made and has excellent acting. however there are a ridiculous amount of characters, each with their own mission and agendas. you might be able to get the gist by reading accompanying wikis and utilising the rewind button but you really have to pay attention. this is not an easy watch. i stuck with it for a good two seasons and concentrated really hard.i often enjoy fantasy films but not big on historical themes unless there is an excellent storyline or humour in there. this may have affected my opinion of this series. they talk a lot throughout the film. there is action but it can get confusing figuring out why people are hacking each other to pieces again. i just wish there was less strategising and more dragons."
2014-04-07,binbarcelos,Its like Gossip Girl in the medieval times,10,"i watch the series because my boyfriend is a fan. i've tried to like it, but it's hard you know?i don't mind violence and sex, but i think this is the only thing game of thrones has to offer. for me it's just terrible, the characters are the worst human beings portrayed on tv. they don't know loyalty, friendship or respect. all i see is gossip and betrayal, with tons of sex and naked girls just because.even after watching the first episode of the third season i still don't know what the plot is. there were so many screen time for silly fights between lovers i tought i was watching gossip girl."
2019-05-08,jasraj423,The best show ever,9,"game of thrones have been the most amazing show ever and it continues to keep its fans elated. they always leave us on a cliffhanger. each episode of every season is phenomenal, well,written and adapted.no doubt, this episode was amazing too. it had those thrilling moments and conversations. so much happened and things changed drastically. just hoping the final two episodes to be amazing as well."
2015-03-01,khantalhano1,Best series Ever,8,"this show is damn awesome. the location, the characters, the targeriyans, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet, wolves, the night's watch, the wall, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the noob who becomes the king, the cunning lannisters, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word khal drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon baelish, and much much more!i don't generally prefer tv shows because they run too long and the story keeps never ends. luckily my friend recommended that since entire season 1 is out there, why not watch it all? here's the twist, each episode is a master-piece. i watched first episode, my mind blew-off in bewilderment of the 'pure' violence & love, the characters displayed to play the game of thrones. the baratheon king is a extremely cunning character, who never takes the center stage and yet remains purely in power. the starks are the most lovable family with an unfathomable family pride. the all- powerful lannisters, a family or kingdom in themselves. the bastard dwarf is one of best characters i have ever seen in any tv show. a character so tiny yet so powerful. tyrion lannister's dialogue delivery & portrayal of 'the bastards' is absolutely stunning. he is chatty and witty, probably the only lannister without the trademark characteristics of a lannister!and i could go on and on about the other characters!more than anything, all episodes remains absolutely loyal to the title, 'game of thrones'."
2019-12-05,aomar8008,Ending was Disappointing.,10,"it is sad to watch how they ended up the show. the mystery of circles of white walkers, white walkers magic and everything that we were waiting to be unveiled for 7 seasons was gone in a second. similarly, danny was instantly turned into mad queen. the story is squeezed to fit in 7 episodes and is changed. it would have been better."
2021-04-13,letmeshowyou2111,Why why why,10,"could've been the best tv series out there, it's still pretty good if you pretend season 8 never happened.season 8 was so carelessly made, they didn't even proof check the thing. you'll find a mistake in nearly every episode."
2019-05-20,abaysi00,don't watch season 8....read the fan theories.....those are better.,10,honestly...after season 8...it all feels empty and unanswered.i'd say: don't watch season 8....read fan theories...or better yet...make up your own ending...and wait for the books.
2017-03-24,edistiesto,I am deeply impressed,7,"it contains sex,war and all the primitive stuff that attracts us.but it also contains culture,intelligence,fantasy,psychology,mind games,and everything that makes a film great.thank you producers!this is the kind of movie that pulls you out from the outside world deep,deep into the fantasy.during the 60 minutes that it lasts,you will not think of real life problems or something else.it is beautiful,thank you!"
2019-05-09,langa140691,Disapointed with season eight,10,i have good moment with episode 1 and 2 in season 8 but i was disappointed with everything that happened after that

2019-05-22,atheerxperia2,thanks,10,i dont have any comment to write now thank you for your time
2014-03-27,sufiblob786,Best TV Show that's still on!,3,"such a good tv show, nearly as good as breaking bad. but it needs to tune down on the unnecessary sex and nudity! sean bean is such a good actor and i hate the fact that they killed him off but that's the thing with game of thrones, it's unpredictable so you never know what's going to happen. i love the fact that at the end of every episode something big happens and it keeps you guessing for the next episode and breaking bad did that but i think game of thrones does it better! peter dinklage is an awesome actor especially in this show, series 4 is starting soon and i sure as hell hope they don't kill him because it would then get irritating, and killing off all the characters would get repetitive, the acting is very good, however for some actors, it's not the best. but if they kill of peter dinklage, i will stop watching."
2020-11-07,gunner_sa,Best Art Work on Tv ever .. from beginning till the end,8,first. i'm not sure why everyone is mad at the end.. i guess cause i didn't wait for 10 years as you ..... i watched it from beginning till the end for the first time in 3 weeks and god oh god what a show..... i watched it as a long movie and i enjoyed alllll the thrill ... the characters ... the deep story and the music ..... the ending was great for me and perfect for each characters....i guess the new viewers will love it more than those who started watching since 2011.
2014-04-20,bhoutist,Awesome !!,1,"game of thrones is a great series, not mainly because of it's great visual effects, fast action and cinematic looks (although those are pretty good too...), but because of it's characters. they are all extremely believable and interesting, they really are the heart of this series. should those characters be taken away, then everything collapses dramatically, for sure. almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. with every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. the only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective. but that's a detail and doesn't nearly compare to the greatness of this series. i really recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it!"
2011-07-25,valerie-barca,Good adaptation,9,"very pleased with the first season very like real life (ahaha)though this reminds me how sad this story was.pros the center of the book tyron lannister is a real hit in the series cons the wolves are more second world war german pets to me hope the dragons wil save the non,human reputation...hope the rest of the troup will keep on playing a few more seasonsworst case scenario would be a success, with all of us waiting for the word the end written on paper in 2021or even worst, worst... audience failure...martin commits suicide and a no end book awful !!!hail to the north !!!with some chance, this could be the harry potter saga for those over 30 with a princess in the foot and knight in the ankle.let's enjoy what it lasts."
2020-10-14,franciscakos_1996,Another disappointing ending,10,"i'd have given it a 10/10 if they haven't made us wait years to give us such a terrible last season. they peaked at season 6 then it just went downhill real fast, character developments got destroyed the plot lines that were beautifully written got ruined or completely thrown into the abyss. sigh what a disappointment really"
2019-12-28,krazy_kalle,"Everything awesome, but the Ending. Should've been another season",9,"as most review probably point out, the last season is mostly terrible.first 7 seasons are a completely great piece of art. good story, great plottwists, amazing characters, and a good amount of action (sword fights and stuff)but in the last season, stuff is going down. character arcs make no sense anymore, the last part of the story is completely rushed (it's not even bad, it's just badly told).sadly that is something that makes the show nearly impossible to rewatch because in the end, nearly everything that is happening is nearly pointless.the only thing that could save this show would be to refilm the last season and make it two seasons and to rethink some decisions, but that is unrealisticmany endings have been unsatisfying in the past (dexter, mass effect trilogy, lost, etc.) but this show for me was the biggest buildup with the worst ending until now.so 7 stars for the first 7 seasons from me, or 3 stars taken away for the last seasons let down."
2015-02-01,raed-alsaned,Best TV series ever,10,"game of thrones is the best tv i have ever seen in tv history. the story is very deep and the character as well. the soundtrack is epic.game of thrones has drama , action , comedy , tragedy and very emotional moment that the fans will never can forget.the quality of the production is very high and the directors know what they should do to make the series amazing as same as the books. there are many actors that i like them such as john snow , robert stark, oberyn martel and so on. i highly recommended game of thrones for all people who like drama and action as this is epic which can't happen again for the long time. while i watched the first episode i had the same excitement as the time when i first read the book. hbo has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. sean bean was born for the role of eddard stark. costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. actors are perfect for the role they play in the series."
2014-05-01,mr-irish-jacko,Great show and a very great Cast! (SPOILERS)!,9,"game of thrones is a lovely show. its something you will get attached to very quickly,as the characters have unique personalities a.k.a arya stark,john snow,khalisie these are the few of many. i only started to watch game of thrones a week ago and watched all of them i instantly fell in love with the show its a beautifully made show with great actors and the sets where they film is astounding,it's really creative and when you watch you'll instantly fall in love with characters or you'll hate someok now i will get into characters no.1 joeffrey, he's a guy who you will want to murder but you don't,he's a son of the royal family the ""lannistersno.2 the starks, since there's a lot of the starks i'll cut it down no.1 arya stark,a sweet but stubborn little girl who is tomboy and loves boy activities besides what other ladies would no.2 john snow a great fighter who signed up for the knights watch, but the only family that he thinks he has left is his trusty companion 'ghost' who is a dire wolf"
2019-05-20,nmr-user,Astonishingly Disappointed,10,"i'm not one to follow a series as it is released. mainly because of my impatience as a viewer. i get so involved, that i have to fuel the fire all at once. eight years in the making, the suspense was. boy, let me tell you, the imagination was surpassed ten fold when i actually started the series. it was a bit slow to begin with, though once it took flight, it soared. the writing, character development, portrayal, and the wonder. astonishing. unfortunately, the series stumbled, then tripped. the swan dive was horrifying. such potential ripped from the very soul of the once beautiful masterpiece. with no effort really. all by just the last two episodes. it pains me to have to leave such a terrible review. a 6/10 is actually a bit courteous. i feel sorry for those that followed from day one with such patience. maybe reading the books will make something better."

2019-05-14,falasene-amoor,Disappointed,10,"unfortunitly very poor scribt, writing and events they burned most of the powerful charecters and removed their roles
they just give a childish girl a dragon and told her rule 😅"
2015-01-30,aakashgupta-icai,The best show ever !!!,7,"the best thing about this show is how close it brings fantasy to reality, keeping in touch with the imagination and exhilaration of dragons. the thing i personally hate about movies or shows that are based on novels or books is how much they leave behind, but got not only appreciate george's (author of the song of ice and fire; the books the show is based on) work but takes it a step further by adding a sense of surprise even for the book lovers.there are plot twists and treachery at every corner, and this is not your every day show where the protagonist gets away with almost anything. the show is the best ensemble of politics, war, fantasy and every thing else (including dragons, you just cant get enough of them). the cast and creators have done a fantastic job. the cast is the best set of actors that make you love or hate the character in an instant. you will see dwarfs in a completely different light after this show. and you just cant hate joffrey and cersi enough. and if all the above doesn't get you hooked to the show ... there are boobies and a lot of them."
2014-05-24,dgr63,Game of thrones,3,"of all the characters, there are always some favorites. for me, i liked that, because i think an intelligent, nuanced and capable of surprising the reader character, tyrion lannister is, as i suppose it has happened to most. though i will say that arya stark and jon snow (whose character reminded me of ender, from ender's game) are also to my liking. also there are hateful and evil, but without them there would be a good story. among the negative things i've found, i note that, despite the maps, i struggled to follow the routes of the characters at times. i was also like that it was not necessary to describe the costumes of all the characters every time they appeared. whichever is the main protagonist of the chapter, some descriptions were more."
2014-05-26,tcrank33,The best thing on television since the Wire.....,10,"i gave got a 10 out of 10 score of course, how could you not? this show is the best thing that is on premium television and all of television period. you could argue breaking bad possibly but bad and i had a falling out, it became boring to me at points up until the series finale....holy crap!!but it still does not compare to got. yes true detective was amazing but not as big or as epic as got. i was a huge fan even before the show started. i have read all the books and when i heard hbo was going to do the got series i lost my mind and was so stoked so i read all the books again to catch up before the show started. i have not missed an episode and do not plan to. i recommend this show very much. it has everything; drama, action, romance and crazy plot twists. george r.r. martin has no problem killing off main characters which just adds to the excitement and suspense because no one is safe...."
2019-05-13,tsuroesp,Last two seasons are a joke,10,"an overall masterpiece but the last two seasons are just inexplicably dumb. bad writing all over. bad decisions at every step. the moment the show got ahead of the books it all went downhill. still worth watching, especially seasons 1,4."
2019-05-20,bernardosc22,Lost about 80 hours of my life seeing this,10,"loved the series (10/10) up until the very last episode, which utterly ruined everything (1/10). before this episode i would recommend the series to everyone. now i don't recommend it to anyone.
disappointing to say the least."
2019-05-08,mike242121,#1 show of all time,1,i began watching the show the day before season 8 premiered and i am now finishing season 7. greatest show of all time. the episodes are an hour long and you cant even notice. i tell myself one more and i watch 3 after that
2014-06-04,morbiz,The Bad Guys Always Win,1,"this show is probably the most disappointing thing watched in a long time. at first, i didn't mind the concept of the good guys not prevailing. however, as the show goes on. it becomes more of a parody of itself, and in some cases – unrealistic. there is no sense of balance between the protagonists and the antagonists. the antagonists always seem to prevail despite the overwhelming odds against them. its funny when people state that this is 'realistic' and i should watch a bugs bunny cartoon if i criticize its cynical nature. if you think about it, if the antagonists and the protagonists would have swap places. people will find this show cliché and predictable.lets stop pretending that this show is morally grey. if this show was morally grey the lannisters wouldn't act so obviously evil. while the starks wouldn't act so righteous and just. making the starks uphold honor unlike their nefarious counterparts is a trick. the writers want you to get emotionally involved and like these characters. they do this so they can shock you by killing them off. the lannisters will always win no matter what. the very fact that most of the relevant members of the family is still alive and most of the starks members are dead should tell you something. even when they're against a noble house that is just as powerful as they are. they managed to kill off the prince of that house in the most anticlimactic way. the prince isn't even all that honorable to be honest. you see – in game of thrones even the anti,heroes don't win. evil prevails and gets rewarded and you can't be even slightly good like prince.the arrogant fans of this show/books is also aggravating. always saying this show is a realistic fantasy, and should read harry potter if i want a good vs evil showdown. well guess what.. this is a good vs evil showdown, and rather then being realistic, its just nihilistic. you see, real life isn't as dark as this show. even during the middle ages most the public lived a somewhat peaceful life. yes people were a lot more brutal and cruel compared to modern standards, but they still had a trace of morality. the people in this show have no morals, and the ones that do are killed off. of course there is people like jon snow and that targerean queen. the problem with them is that jon snow is always a underling to corrupt officials. and the targerean queen is too far away to make a difference. there is also the stark kids but they're not a threat to the iron throne. the writers obviously want the good guys to remain powerless and non-threatening so it can give you the illusion of being 'dark' and 'edgy'. sorry, i didn't fall for your magic trick. i find this show extremely juvenile and predictable."

2019-07-31,erika_lemmens,Stop watching after season 7,10,"why why why end this show like that.... so many options but this was by far the worst one. no confrontation with cersei, quickie to end the winter king, suddenly turned crazy queen, i can keep going on like this. shame!"
2012-06-06,mabbs88,It's not TV. It's HBO.,10,"by writing this review i know am not adding anything further than what all the other top reviews have said. however i felt the need to spite the terrible narrow,mindedness of the low reviews of this show.game of thrones is another exceptional piece of television produced by hbo. the depth and breadth of the series plot and it's characters is incredible. i've not seen anything as impressive on television since battlestar galactica.if you are having doubts due to the shows minority of naysayers, don't! this is quality entertainment and television as it should be. the writing is gripping, the production values astounding, and the performances by the cast a joy to behold. if i had only one criticism of this programme is that is too good and it is very cruel to make us wait so long for it's further instalments."
2019-05-25,leslieethel,Easy rating,1,this show would be better if it was breaking bad. it wouldn't let me just post that so this part is filler.

2014-09-03,lukepowerlfc,Brilliant - no spoilers here,10,"i love game of thrones. i thought the first few episodes were a little dull, however they explain a lot about the story and if you plan to watch, i'd suggest you listen to them carefully (of course i was on my phone and looked up wiki pages to explain what i mist) the overall series is brilliant. if you haven't watched it, i'd suggest you do, it's for everyone, no matter what you like, you'll be hooked on it. i myself a big lover of the whole dragon/sword fighting, my mother who is more into soaps, my girlfriend who loves the likes of twlightlight and my brother who hates the whole sword/dragon type series all love it, no matter what you like you'll love got."

2014-07-14,joshrichards733-53-948126,1/10 compared to books,10,compared to the game of thrones series of books. arya stark is complete and utter wuss. where as in the tv series they review as a i innocent girl. but in the books she kills the hound kills a man in the pub kills 2 guards too escape lanister jail. also dinklage is too good looking for the half man. in the book he has one eye and no nose from his attack not just a scar. and he is completely horrendous all that dinkalge is is small. also the ages are off rob and jon are supposed to be 14/15.not 25. and arya is 10. and sansa is 13. not 15 also joffery is 12 not 17. i think it is ruined compared to the books.

2019-05-20,chaoticchristine-86-988278,Last 2 seasons were ruined,9,"everything about seasons 1,6 was great, everything made sense. seasons 7 & 8 had bad writing, things were rushed and most of the plot made no sense whatsoever.it's a shame they ruined such an amazing story exactly at the end. the last episode got me laughing so hard, the writing was incredibly childish. it's like a bunch of people wrote on a piece of paper what they think season 8 should be, put everything in a pile, and they just drew randomly a paper from the pile and built the season after that.thanks for six great seasons :p!"
2019-05-02,mibs_959,Used to be a 9/10... after S8E3 it became 1/1000,9,how... how can you prepare us for this moment for over 7 seasons and end it like that? honestly? arya killing the white king like that? pfff... what a joke.
2014-08-24,joe-feghaly,Simply brilliant with near-perfect acting and writing.,8,"the show has brought in some of the most talented children i have ever seen. they are much better actors than a lot of stars today. it deals with real life conflicts, following george martin's masterpiece. it is a production that you know that they've worked on from the bottom of their hearts. they want to surprise you more. this is one of the most talked about shows in the world, yet the cast and crew always have a sense of improving. they give more and more every season.the only downfall of this show is the presence of some boring episodes. however, these episodes are essential to get the story going. the only thing that i found that some find extremely appealing which others find as a huge turn off is the presence of dragons. but the thing is, those dragons aren't just added for the sake of it. they incorporated well into the story. plus, the cgi team is working brilliantly on them."

2014-09-07,karlhepton,Best Show Ever .,1,"this is easily the best show on tv at the minute possibly ever. most unpredictable amazing show i've ever seen. the first season starts rather slow as its mainly character introductions but stick with it it takes a while to learn everyones name but you'll get used to it. it doesn't really pick up in action till around episode 6 so i recommend you give the entire season a chance by the end of it you'll be hooked. i've never given a 10/10 to anything but this show comes closest. season by season there all pretty solid each season seems like a different show due to the large storyline changes. game of thrones has some top class actors such as sean bean, peter dinklage, emilia clarke, charles dance, lena headey, nikolaj coaster,waldau and many more i constantly recommend this show to everyone i know and everyone loves it."
2021-01-24,manmohan-s1313,The best series I ever watched,10,"be cautious before watching this series you might get addicted to it. everything is good in this series, i only feel bad about jon snow in the ending"
2014-09-18,mewler,The Best,1,"do i think this series is currently the best on tv? yes i do. every aspect is spot on. i haven't even touched the books, but this show makes me feel like i don't even need to. the characters all have an extreme amount of depth (despite the massive cast), and the plot leaves you wanting more with each and every episode. i've turned several friends onto this series and have yet to have one not fall in love with it. we've gotten to the point that each year after the season finally we become deeply depressed until the new season begins. that may not be healthy, but this obsession is just another testament to how amazing got really is.i don't really want to give anything away, so i'll stop here. if anyone is debating whether to start watching, don't hesitate!"
2019-05-20,ryanmsilva,One of the Best TV Shows,10,this show had a lot of exciting build up for 7 seasons but then the 8th and last season seemed a bit rushed. overall it was very enjoyable.
2019-06-12,thoar321,Last season very dissatisfied,1,was very very dissatisfied with the last season of got very anticlimactic took seasons to build relationships with characters and for the last season to end like this is a disservice not only to the fans but the actors and actresses who acted and we're amazing and put there reputation on the line just so the directors can focus on other projects really speaks to how the directors actually feel and gives them little credibility towards future projects cause they've done it to got on one of the best series out just the last season didn't seem like it had any juice they were going through the motions cause there were tired of doing the series kinda of like falling out of love they fell out of love with the series and kinda of gives a sense they were going to write the script and have it be a lame script one of the most series finales ever next to the show lost lol.
2014-10-07,gallladder,"Every episode contains drama, and excitement!",8,"this show is one in a million. the difference between game of thrones and other shows is simply this. every episode is grabbing, i found that in breaking bad, or in sons of anarchy, or in true detective that the episodes are not reeling you in every time. but in this masterpiece, i find that i am always interested to watch. one aspect of brilliance includes the dispersion of the various character story lines. e.g. daenerys targarean, or jamie lannister, or arya stark etc. this technique enhances the viewers attention, and gives the audience something new to look forward to, rather than three or four characters that are followed the whole episode (like other tv shows). overall, this is my favourite show, and is excellent. no other show competes with got, winter is coming!!!"
2014-10-12,amiyak4-130-390719,Simply Mind Blowing,4,"the best tv series ever best direction best special effect best screenplay amazing cast it is full of thriller. the best thing about it is u can never guess what is about to happen.. i am just waiting for season 5.. in season 1 i thought ned stark is the main char..then he died then i thought his son robb stark is the main char then he died in then you all must have predicted the scorpion ll win n imp ll be spared but see what happened.. i have never read the book but i think that's why i find it much interesting got u cant predict.. here is what i think ll happen.arya stark , imp ll never die..and the hound ll survivesome cool characters are : arya ,imp ,hound ,jamie and the bastard(forgot his name)"
2015-06-04,antoneoo-jesus,Bran Stark and dragons!!!,10,"brandon stark the second son of ned and catelyn never showed up in season 5 until now (episode 8)... before his disappearance the old man told him he will fly not walk, so i guess he must control creatures beyond crows, wolves, or hodor... he must control the missing dragon for daenerys targaryen, and the real war begins... he must seek to get the north back and no more escaping, no more climbing especially with his sister sansa stark at the north in the meantime they could do a great job ruling the north and defend it against stannis baratheon's army. if bran stark never show in season 5 it will be a shock to all of us, we want to know what will happen for him..."

2021-08-05,rachelscherschel,Just Can't Do It,1,"i loved the books, and given how many of my friends liked the show, i was excited to see that it came with hbo+ i knew there was nudity and language and i was prepared for that, so i figured i'd be just be able to latch onto the award winning cinematography, costumes, and sets, and enjoy watching the storyline come to life, and if be able to tune out the rest of it. i tried. i really did. but there comes a point where the directors seemed to add in beyond graphic nudity and excessive language just for the sake of it, which personally ruined the show for me. like i said, i had read the books and friends watched the show, so i obviously didn't go into it blind. but i just couldn't make it through. it would be interesting to know how much of the series didn't have graphically nude people in screen can't the amount of time it did. if someone is willing to tune some episodes, is love to see the results!"

2014-11-17,xthebalistic,Amazing! (English),10,"game of thrones is my absolute favorite series. it has everything you could want from a good series. love, hate, joy, excitement, sadness and of course sex appeal. the actors fit their roles perfectly, and the roles perfectly in the story. the story is over time becoming more demanding and branches to dozens of people. the scenes are also incredible and win the heart of the viewer. for every fantasy fan game of thrones is simply required. with his history, his characters and his scenes of game of thrones is one of the best series ever. so i recommend everyone to buy the series, it sure is worth it.,,game of thrones is an incredible experience"""
2015-08-08,littlefingered33,WoW,10,"very intriguing and the most binge worthy show ever. my favourite show ever as the world is so vast and brilliant. from characters like joffrey and littlefinger and even minor characters like yoren and bronn have their own background and story you can invest in. i strongly recommend this show to anyone who has never seen it and have to say that even breaking bad is trumped by this show. not only is there interesting characters and even more interesting story lines there is also dragons and white walkers. my personal favourite characters are the villains such as both the boltons and karl tanner and of course joffrey but my favourite character is arguably the hero of the show,jon snow.i very strongly recommend anyone to try this show. as i watched the first 4 seasons in just a week."

it's so so so sad to see final seasoning is so boring, ruining the characters from s1-7. i expect bran has some contribution after becoming three eyed raven, but he did nothing. and why the king of while walker can be killed so easily? like just 1 sec arya jump from the back, and he just dead like that.hope can retake season 8 for all the got fans"

2018-03-02,fouadmabchour,Nothing much needs to be said.,8,this is one show which has captured the attention of masses like no other. the characters make sure that there is always something more to offer i was amazed at the buzz this show is creating in terms of fan theories.

Still recommend people watch it!,1,"regardless of how disappointing a lot of people found the last season you have to give respect to the cast and crew for giving us an amazing series that we all thoroughly did enjoy over the years. from ned stark's death to the red wedding... king joffrey to ramsay bolton... hardhome to battle of the ... it has been an honour to watch one of the greatest tv series of all time.. i will always recommend that people who haven't watched it binge through all the seasons this summer and apart from the last season, enjoy it for what it is... and that is a fantastic show!"
2019-05-25,turak64-190-449926,Shame the Internet hate bandwagon had to happen,10,"it's still one of the greatest shows ever to be on tv and only time will tell if season 8 will get the respect i think it deserves. i think people either expected the impossible or were gutted that they don't get the satisfaction of having their predictions come true. a show that was loved because of its unexpected twists and turns, had an unexpected ending that for some reason that had annoyed a lot of people. obviously everyone would have liked a few more episodes or perhaps even one more season, but it's certainly not as bad as all these arm chair critics claim it to be."
2015-06-03,tommysirett,Fantastic!!,10,"amazing, never been so addicted to a series before, such a thrilling storyline and you never know what is going to happen next! the characters in game of thrones are brilliant, you grow to love some of the characters, and loathe others which one of the main things i love about a good series. the whole story takes place simultaneously over different areas of westeros, and are constantly being priced towards a finally solution, who will claim the iron throne? no one knows! it's such an exciting series because you can't anticipate what is going to happen next. there are many twists, shock deaths and retributions keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the series and in my opinion game of thrones is the best thing on television at the moment, no doubt!"

2019-05-11,zemahesham,6/10,10,last season sucks no logic bad writing no answers building characters for 7 seasons and just end them badly
2019-03-30,billb0313,Incredible...if you need a nap,7,"total snoozefest. utterly boring and a waste of acting talent, set design, music...etc. here's a little secret on how to watch this series: watch the first 2 minutes where they explain what happened in the previous episode. fast forward to the final 10 minutes (it's the only part of the show where anything happens) and watch the final 10 minutes. rinse and repeat. i plan on watching every episode in one sitting. should take about 2 hours."
2019-05-14,prthmv,Best Series eve..... Garbage,9,"from the very first episode, this series has been setting up great expectations and delivering more than i could imagine. it begins with slowly and naturally introducing us to the ton of characters in the show, all the while keeping us hooked on to amazing story. this has everything one could hope for in a show and more. the brilliant world created here has kings, warriors, slaves, giants, beasts, magic and what not, and yet seems very real. every action has consequences. i guess this justifies why it took george r.r martin so many years to write the books these are based on. everything about the show is wonderful, that is untill they ran out of the story from the books. i haven't read the books this is based on. but i could clearly feel that some thing has changed drastically since season 6. this series suddenly seemed like any other series. for me, the show has been severely degrading since then. there have been some great moments and good episodes. but the over all story seems random. it feels like they are planning these great moments and fights, and then randomly connecting the dots in between.
it is very frustrating to see such an awesome show end so badly."
2015-02-16,osama_qht,great show,10,"great show, it contains a lot of conflict between rulers and inside the family's. every one is trying to claim their own interests and benefits that's what makes it so special. they way they make it so good is incredible each time you think there is a number 1 star or hero they kill him so they can make you feel curious more to watch what will happen next. the seven kingdoms... each family thinks they are the right full rulers and try's to claim the iron throne back; and my opinion and i never read the books; later on there will be joining of families to be stronger and every family will try to betray their allies to gain what they want no matter what. 10 out of 10 for sure. recommended..."
2015-02-17,goldenreelawards,Overrated,8,"perhaps the most overrated and pointless show in television history, filled with a cast that wants to do something original but just can't tap the vein, a writing team that can never truly come up with great dialog or enough memorable moments, and so much useless nudity that anyone who truly appreciates story over pointless attempts to gain viewers will be turned off within ten minutes. the show does do right, though, with how it rests solely on hbo , hopefully it stays that way. this way, people who have regular cable will never have to sit through such a boring and overrated show. the only thing that people have right is that the camera-work on this show is actually decent, but breaking bad topped this thing in every episode, and sometimes an episode would go by in brba without a single great camera angle. got is overrated to the max, and that's the truth."
2015-03-25,davidborstein911,One very sick show,10,"the question is not why we would watch such shows as why they would make them. they may simply want to test the limits of the art of film/show making. perhaps they foster serious discussions of difficult subject. in my opinion, they are simply not worth the price of the film stock they are printed on. arty crap is still crap. don't waste your time on this. this is the kind of sick, nausea,-inducing garbage that the said crowd, especially westerners. this was probably the worst piece of cinema i've encountered, considering its very thin and simplistic plot, shadowing the disturbing atmosphere of very sinister subjects which were specifically, incest, rape and murder. the people who made the show and watch the show are just sadly very sick humans. this show is immoral, perverted and completely filthy. i watched the pilot and i felt so dirty and disgusted; all i saw was meaningless sex, degrading women, incest, perversion and extreme violence. where have our morals gone to allow shows and movies like this to be so popular??? i don't like fantasy stuff and this show is just the worst i have ever seen, i can't understand why so many people like it. it's just horrible and annoying, i hate it! first time i saw it i almost puked, the characters were so annoying and even the main characters died, what is this show even about - death and war? i mean the actors are so emotionless and boring, you can see that they hate to work for this tv show. i mean seriously it's the first time i saw this show and i already hate it, how is this even possible without sucking so much? who is the audience that likes this show, who? nerds and wow-players, i mean seriously why do people watch this when there are so many better shows pure filth!!! 0/10"

2019-05-22,micrudolph,Draws you in then cheeses you out,9,"the final two seaons completely ruins this show. the first four seasons of brilliantly complex and brutal political drama, are followed by season 5 and 6 where the show still tries but looses it's way a little. in season 7 and 8 it decends into a typical hollywood blend of cliche ridden action film and trivial romance. it doesn't even succeed very well on those two parameters seen in isolation. there is much better action and romance out there. the only reason to carry on watching at this point is to get conclusions on the dense story line and character development one has invested in over the previous 6 seasons. over its final two seaons, the show however lets down almost every single story arch and becomes entirely plot driven. the characters turn into hollow shells of their former selves and their actions hugely inconsistent. all the decisions they take and everything else that happens is entirely written to drive the plot forward in a rush towards the ending. it leaves you cheated and hungry, yet my score is 6 of 10 based on the brilliance the show was for most of its first two thirds."
2019-06-19,verum-04856,Pointless,10,"i read an interview with the actors of the series who said that it was disrespectful to demand to retake the 8th season. no! this disrespect of the unfortunate screenwriters to all those involved so end a wonderful show. disrespect for actors, film crew, fans. all this work was in pointless.after the two seasons everything went downhill. well, no wonder , after all, martin himself was responsible for them, so they were so good.well, this last season is a terrible burden. and the final ... god, how stupid it is. nagging about striking drones again?!?!. how terrible it is. how innocent people suffer. seriously?!?! the old silly songs again?!. therefore, they have shown this scene for so long in order to convey the message. three times arya covered with stones. intentionally lengthened scene.well, and electoral democracy from the mouth of tirion. lord, to whom, for whom do you say this? the plot, the characters waited for depth. but the screenwriters are 16-year-old pimply teenagers who protest. well, you can protest against taxes. or snow."
2015-03-13,ram-jac,What it's all for?,10,"murder. dragons. murder. nudity. oh, did i mentioned murder? that's pretty much it. this is what this series is about. and i watched season 1 and 2. it was horrible and i'll never get this time back. what's the matter with this generation? the hype surrounding this series scares me a lot. no sympathy at all, no memorable characters (because they all die right before they do or say anything memorable). the one and only thing i liked is the camera work. one of the saddest things is to see so many great and talented actors in this senseless series. i'm disappointed. i'm disappointed that this kind of series is so popular. so otherwise i would recommend to stay away from the series , now after watching the whole season - i 'd say : get the f outta here!"

2016-11-04,fredrik-hjarner,"Unfortunately, a waste of time",10,"once again i am in front of the tv seeing an extremely over,hyped series. i swore that i'd never do this mistake again after the last flop of trying to watch ""heroes"" and drawing the correct conclusion that everything that is too hyped is bad.this time the hype was overwhelming! i decided (against my gut feeling) that i try and watch whole season and continue to watch no matter what, because otherwise people would just make the classical argument that ""you can't know if it's bad if you've only seen a few episodes"".actually, in fact, a very important point here is that actually all you ever need to see in order to judge is the first episode of a series, the so called ""pilot episode"". producers know that the first impression is important and so the pilot is the most expensive episode of all. if the pilot is bad, the series is bad.nonetheless, i watched the whole first series. game of thrones is not good, it is just hyped.the acting, music and graphics is not bad, but the story is. it is boring to watch. episodes end with cliff hangers that promise that something exciting is going to happen in the next episode. but nothing exciting ever happens and you feel tricked.never again will i let my mind be hijacked by group mentality and hype."

2011-04-20,camelspottergr,"Sadlly, not quite what i expected..",7,"well. i took my time to register just so i can write my first review.i always read viewer's reviews and many times i come to agree. sadly this is not the story here, for the majority of the people who watched the pilot episode have so many good things to say about the series that i happen not to.first i would like to say that yes, it sticks to the original plot and many significant events and dialogues are kept intact. graphics are good, the whole scenery is good, clothing and such.but.. it lucks the atmosphere and some of the dialogue is thrown to us like something that has to be said just because it has to for the sake of the plot and character's depth. (like the part where viserys talks to his sister for what it will take so long as he as his army). also come to say about the atmosphere.. they found a forest,painted it white and there's your haunted forest. not dark, frightening and clostophobic as it is described on the book. atmosphere lost there... also the crypts where all the uncestors lie dead.. they found a dungeon and that's it.. the part where it ends and bran gets thrown out of the window was made in 10 minutes, on one go..just so they can call it a wrap. the words again ''the things i do for love'' are said with no character depth, no real emotion. he just said it without mining anything.. thinsg like that make this series as shallow as it gets and far from the book's atmosphere.though it seems to follow closely to the text all the other things that ,to me, matter as equal are paid no real attention thus making this not quite enjoyable.. lets all hope it will all get fixed as it goes. thank you for your time reading this!"

2018-12-13,olenoess,The 9.5 is no longer warranted.,10,"let's be real here, since dan & dave passed the books they have been making really bad decisions. nowhere close to as good character development. watching seasons 1,4 is a pure joy in terms of intellectual prowess, watching seasons 5-7 is predictable and made for the masses. game of thrones excelled because of the intellectual hype, so many smart people were talking about it as this new big thing and whatever they talk about the masses want a piece, no series ever was as fun to debate and have discussions about as george rr martins epic. character development has soured and there are so many gary stu and mary sues, the scene where they go north of the wall to get a wight is so badly written, why does he not just kill drogon? why do none of the dragons just land and smash the night king, ludicrous. i am not even gonna get started on euron or the dorne storyline which is worse than æ soap-opera.dan & dave do not get enough flack for ruining this masterpiece by excluding george and the books, it is so easy to see that they just want this series to end and reap the rewards that they will get after, miguel sapochnik is the real hero of the show."
2015-05-01,marijnmanche,"Brilliant, captivating, in-depth story.",10,"well then. game of thrones is one of the very few movies/shows i can stand. i despise cliché story lines, bad acting, predictability, game of thrones has none of these letdowns. a brilliant story, constantly playing with your emotions, head and heart. the impossible becomes possible, a world where anything and everything happens.amazing, detailed cast, incredible portrayal of the monsters that lie, sleeping, inside all of us.there is no 9.5/10, so i will stick with a 9. there is almost nothing wrong with game of thrones, one or two things that could be better, but overall, the single best show i have ever watched. if you want to be taken on a wild ride, through magical lands full of wolves, lions, dragons, stags and golden roses with extremely sharp thorns, game of thrones is definitely the one to watch!"
2015-05-05,staticnot,Books are better,1,if your a fan of the books this show will infuriate you. if weiss and benioff wanted to write their own story than why did they have to buy the rights to song of ice and fire. grrm is a brilliant writer and has created a world many people love. weiss/benioff have taken his amazing source material and rewritten it very poorly. changing story lines to point that make little sense. changed characters personalities and arcs. killed off characters who still play a huge role in the books. and most importantly taken grrms amazing dialogue and replaced it with poorly written garbage. i know books have to be changed for screen but a complete rewrite is ridiculous. could've just wrote your own story and left westeros alone.
2019-06-04,h_sko,Never forget The Game of Thrones,9,"even though season 8 is a disappointment compared to the level of game of thrones, rating this series 5, 6, and 7 by the fans just because the final season was ""bad"" is unacceptable, 6/8 seasons of this show were perfect, season 7 was good as well, season 8 not the same level, but it is and will always be the best series ever existed"
2019-05-29,mikeywarmke,A good Ending,5,the ending to this show was indeed a very controversial way to end a phenomenal tv show that has been going on for the last decade. but as someone who had just recently started watching the show and i can say for one that this ending was exactly how it was going to end. from season 2 there was major foreshadowing leading to daenerys destroying kings landing and how she would win the throne. this was bound to happen i am one for this ending.(they should've dragged out the long night episode)
2020-09-05,sonivasu-54459,Too Long And Pathetic,1,a too long pathetic show. i will ask you not to waste your time watching this.
2019-04-26,jobje_havenaar,Why this is different,10,"after so much has been said and so much appraisal has been given one can only tell his own story on how he fell in love with this series.i started watching the series when the first season came out, and it wasn't love at first sight. complex storylines, a whole history that you had to dig into as well as an enormous amount of characters you needed to get familiar with. after a couple of episodes i even stopped watching since it felt like i had to put in so much effort and there was not enough action going on anyway.how wrong i was.i gave it another try because even though the series was hard to grasp in full, it still triggered the sense that it was something unique. this resulted in a bingewatch of the first two seasons. i got so impatient afterwards, that i bought all books and read them before the third season. surprisingly, watching the third season and knowing the story (the red wedding!!!) beforehand still didn't make the tv,show feel like any cheap version of the books. in later seasons it has on occasion, but who can blame the writers with such an ever expanding story and number of characters? grrm is still struggling with this, looking at the amount he needs for the books :)now that the final season is here and the battle with the white walkers is ready to start, i cannot help but feel deeply thankful for what got added to all the viewers' lives. it created understanding that people are not just 'good or bad' but act because of emotions, family, history, etc (with certain exceptions ofc like joffrey, he probably embodies more of pure evil than the night king). also got gave me all of the emotions i can think of in such an intensity that i rarely had in real life.it feels so sad that it will end! i think writing my first review ever is also part of me saying goodbye to my favorite story.everything new to watch from now on will never be the same. thanks to all whom made it possible!now i'm going to rewatch emotional, heroic and disastrous scenes again before the battle of the night king begins."
2019-05-20,smaloney-42565,Watch Game of Thrones and be excited for what comes next.,3,"first and foremost, i watch a lot tv and have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. despite a relatively disappointing finish, game of thrones was a fantastic show. (season 7 and 8 are pretty ugly ). however, i can say the same about the incredibly popular show the office. fantastic writing and acting across the board, but some disappointing moments best forgotten. season 1 though 6 of got are incredible, and everyone deserves a watch. you will never see anything like it. regardless of how people feel regarding it's finish, everyone should be excited for what the future holds. game of thrones has set the bar for t.v shows and t.v enthusiasts should be ecstatic for what comes next regarding shows. writers and directors learn from each other and will look up to game of thrones as inspiration for their work. this is what i am most excited about; not the spin offs that i am confident will be coming soon, but the shows that will become even better than thrones. game of thrones will not be remembered as the greatest show of all time. more importantly, i believe it will be the reason the best shows exist."
2019-04-29,srinidhic,Goosebumps guaranteed,10,just a cracker of an episode. arya. your a freaking amazing killer. omg. can't take the excitement. insane. out of words.
2019-05-20,amer-36260,How do I recommend anyone watch it after s8,10,"i had no issues recommending this series to anyone. and most thanked me for introducing the series to them. but after the ending... what's the point when it's not any longer a whole story. it used to be a multilayered story that you'd get engrossed in. but after season 8... alot of the build up meant nothing... so watching 1,7 seasons seems like a waste of time."
2015-06-14,lelya-99485,Shocking violence,9,"very disturbing scenes. impossible to watch. disgusting. that's not what i expected from the 'medival times' show. i only like a dragon and white walkers. i wish this show was more suitable for younger generation. it's not fantasy show its a horror fantasy. whatever the write ""adventure drama fantasy"" it's a huge error. it should indicate that it has violence in the most horrific way! calling it just a drama would be a joke. very disturbing scenes. impossible to watch. disgusting. that's not what i expected from the 'medival times' show. i only like a dragon and white walkers. i wish this show was more suitable for younger generation. it's not fantasy show its a horror fantasy. whatever the write ""adventure drama fantasy"" it's a huge error. it should indicate that it has violence in the most horrific way! calling it just a drama would be a joke."
2015-06-18,harjotrandhawahr,Awesome show,10,"with many shows and movies about post,apocalyptic futuristic societies, george martin's game of thrones is a refreshing change. it is a stunning mix of fantasy, drama, and medieval warfare. the book series turned tv show is truly audience engaging with its great cast, attention to fine details, and suspenseful storyline. the cast of a show either makes or breaks it, in game of thrones the cast definitely makes the show. before the end of the first episode, the audience can't help getting attached to certain characters and hating others. one character that the audience can't help but hate is prince joffrey, who attacks a helpless boy who is pretend sword fighting. after joffrey gets hurt he has his father, the king, order to have the boy killed. a character that viewers can't help but love is arya, the daughter of the king's best friend. arya doesn't follow the social norms set for girls, she wants to learn how to fight, be rough, and ride horses like her brothers. when caught pretend sword fighting with her friend she fights back against the prince not caring about his status. jack gleeson and maisie williams bring these characters to life. without the amazing actors and cast there wouldn't be a huge following of the show, which includes over seven million people who watch the show just on tv not including those who watch online. the details are an important part of any book, movie or show. this show is no different because there are so many small details that could easily be forgotten. one would think that the style of clothing, type of armor, or even silverware used to eat wouldn't make a different in watching the show, but it truly does. the clothing distinguishes the poor from the rich, and those who live in warm climates in the south from those in the north in the cold. the armor displays that someone is a knight, or a war soldier. the silverware exhibits financial status. each noble family in the kingdom has their own personal symbol, and when they travel or go to war, flags with the symbol are carried with them. these details didn't come without extreme cost .when watching it is easy to understand why it costs over five million dollars to film each episode. it probably would have been easier to film in front of a green screen, but that would have taken away from the authenticity of the story. the show is filmed in authentic locations all around europe from iceland, spain, croatia, ireland, to malta. when reading a book or watching a movie, it is usually easy to predict the ending. it often times ends when the boy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. this does not happen in game of thrones. all sixty minutes of each episode is action packed. it is nearly impossible to predict a certain character's fate because of the action packed scenes and suspense, even if they seem like a main character. when watching the audience can't help but sit on the edge of their seat not knowing what's going to happen. when past events are tied to recent event, it creates a ""ah ha"" moment that helps viewers understand a certain character's actions in the past. what makes game of thrones great is that it is truly unique, with the use of mystical animals. however, a comparable show is vikings, in both shows the goal is to become king by overcoming numerous obstacles. if you're looking for a show that is action packed, and full of suspense then game of thrones is the show for you. full of great actors with whom the audience can't help but form an emotional attachment to. the attention to fine details creates a sense of authenticity of how the people in the kingdom live. a major point to consider when watching is that no one is ever safe. it never turns out the way the audience anticipates, the future can never be predicted. it will leaving you with a cliffhanger ending."
2015-06-20,spartakarls,Game of Moans :(,10,"got used to be the show i couldn't wait for but now i find it stale, repetitive and the story just isn't moving forward since the end of season three. gratuitous violence doesn't bother me if the violence portrayed is integral to the story or helping to move it forward but now its just shock and awe meant to appeal to the simple minded. season 5 droned on for 7 damn episodes of nothing really happening other than rape, attempted rape, watching a small girl scrub a floor till she goes blind, barbequing another small girl, more small girls get tortured by a pedophile in a brothel and the queen is forced to walk naked through the streets (wow, martin and/or the show writers must really hate women). i get that the writers want to have intrigue and develop the political story but they squeezed all the action into the last three episodes and then it was so predictable, stanis dies, jon snow dies (everybody likes him so of course he has to die), jamies daughter would die, kalesi's flying fire chicken would save her and despite it all the story has barely moved anywhere in five seasons.got is one of the highest production value shows ever made without a doubt but if hbo seems intent on relying way too much on a set recipe of shock and awe, naked people, over the top violent situations (not necessarily violent scenes) and making the audience guess which key characters are going to die instead of an actual progressive story that people can remember from season to season i'm gonna tune out just from pure boredom.actually i think i'm done with this crap show, i won't support shows written by pedophiles. seriously anybody who writes that much sadistic sex and bad things on women into a story should be checked up on by the police. red flag anybody? ramsey bolton should peel the skin off the parents of the child actors for their greed to allow their kids to participate in such scenes. i know they're actors and it's a tv show but they are also children! for christ sake hbo, pushing the envelope doesn't mean abandoning the last vestiges of human morality for the sake of ratings."
2015-06-20,ceo-66032,Series without any ethics and with nothing good to feel about,8,"after seeing today in game of trones how father let her kid/daughter being burned alive, i realized that author of this serial, as well as hbo may need professional (medical) assistance. actually, since the beginning, it is hard to find anything that would make anyone feeling good. seems normal people are in this series only and exclusively heading to miserable ends (being brutally killed, beheaded, burned, skulls being crushed by bare hands to name a few , and any similarity with world around us is pure coincidence) while negative characters are in full swing!so what is the message of your work mr martin? enlighten me, please.as far as i am concerned, g of t is for me finished.mr martin your g of t stories may make a lot of money but are in the essence sick, barbarian and ethically worthless works. no one learned anything from you, neither become a better person by watching your work. wonder if your kids watch your masterpieces and how do you feel about the moment that motivated me to write all this.tom/malta"
2019-05-25,aishazulfiqar,Best show ever despite the last season!,7,"for me game of thrones willl forever remain the best ever tv show. the acting, the characters, the storyline is something that goes out of this world and nothing can ever come close to it! even though season 8 wasn't the best, i still love this show and will rewatch it over and over again! it's a big of part of my life and i don't think anything will ever replace it! i wish i could go back in time just so i could rewatch it again but sadly i cannot. anyways i miss game of thrones so much but all good things come to an end! for those that haven't seen the show definitely watch it!!!!"
2019-04-05,zainq-53132,Lovely tv show its amazing,7,i always likely to see game of throne but at the wnd feel so badly.this season is ended season
2019-01-03,c_wilkerson-95198,Great Television,10,"a series filled with exceptional characters, dialog, action, scenery, and score. the later seasons weaken slightly compared to the earlier ones due to the fact that they surpassed the most recent book, but they still move the story forward in a great way. don't miss out on arguably the best drama series in television history."
2019-10-13,meganprowse,A masterpiece..until the last season,3,the character development and world building in this series is epic. you fall in love with and come to despise people. the characters are so multilayered no one is actually truly good or bad which makes this a fascinating watch. the plot is unpredictable and you are constantly on tenterhooks as there are so many lands and intricate relationships going on that someone is bound to come undone in a dramatic fashion at some time.now for the bad.. after following the characters for years and becoming extremely invested in their outcomes season eight compared to other seasons was rushed and all the little details that used to make game of thrones great we're missing. all we saw was the big things lots of battles leading to quick victories by the good guys and and rushed crowing of the weakest candidate.
2019-06-01,saicooldudeyou,Still the Best Show Ever...but why oh why was the last season so screwed up,5,"one of the most epic tv shows ever created in the history of television...the sets, vfx, locations and everything let's you sit tight for the whole ride until then the road starts getting a little bumpy (season 7) after going a little further you realize there's no road (season 8) and you end up in the middle of nowhere and wonder what's the whole point of that ride in the first place"
2017-03-14,devphilem,Once you see it you can get enough of it.,5,"game of thrones is one of the best tv show till date. one of the main reason people love about this show is every character has an interesting story to tell. many reviewer don't mention about the casting , the actors cast for every character is spot on. no one character is miss cast.the show rightly depicts the various aspects of that particular era the story took place from costumes to the cultures. the show delivered quality episodes every time.it is a must watch show if you like fantasy or even if you haven't watch any before and if you are ok with blood and gore because there will be lot of killing and lots of blood and gore."
2019-03-08,gbreckell,The Final Battle,4,"perhaps there has never been or will be again such a magnificent, absolutely enthralling story of adventure beyond imagination. i have watched all episodes over again, read the books, and listened to all the audio tapes. the dragons are magnification, as is the mother of dragons, daenerys targaryen. i've waited too long this season. we are being built to the ultimate conclusion, then what?"
2015-07-29,saadtariq,"Until World's End, Nothing Can Beat Game of Thrones !",10,"i had watch hundred of shows in my life. but, got is the greatest show i ever watched in my life. i had so much attachment with each character. the got would be the legacy and trademark of hbo. they keep true to the epically written book, and they depict the characters in an excellent way. with a few exceptions i would say they have made what will be an epic show here, and i would really hope that they continue for all the books. the main problem is, that if you don't know the books you are quite lost with the characters and what happened to all of them. but i hope we will get deeper into the minds and backgrounds of those people! the cast for that is really well done and i hope for they can pass on the feelings i got when i read the book!"
2015-07-30,roy-46129,excellent Norse to English adaptation,7,"loving this new twist of old norse stories adapted to the medievel era. some characters are though much more boring than than the norse characters, for example cersei and jamie. sigmund and sigi, the incestuous twins that have a child(sinfjotli) that murders the king and his children. after this leaves his mother queen and sinfjotli eventually is poisoned. this is one of many examples on exactly who the characters in the series are based, not to mention that the entire story is ragnarok. white walkers, dragons and a very well placed loki in the form of petre baelish . if baelish didn't exist stark never goes to kings landing,john aryan lives, cersei and kids die along with daenarys and etc. one of the funnest aspects of the whole series is the way it hints as to what will happen next. for example the irony of tyrion telling oberyn you could at least wear a helmet or theon saying he will look like a eunuch. although i enjoy the series the books are well worth the read as the series does edit much of what it considers filler out. i enjoy the banter of the characters in the books more than i do in the series and of course my favorite parts are almost never put in the show. while the last season strayed further away from the books i'm happy to see it go in that direction and leave more surprises for us fans. unfortunately its norse roots makes it a story i've read before with more profanity."
2017-01-12,jarne_x,Best show I've seen so far,10,"this show is from another level, really!yes i've read the books, but still, i love game of thrones. sure, season one is a little bit slow, but it's for your own good because there are hundreds (probably even more) of characters that you need to get to know before the adventure can start. still, season one ends with a bang! (so please, don't give up too soon... you'll regret it)the story is rather complicated, but the acting, special effects, storytelling, music, ... everything is so well executed! even if you're not a fantasy fan, i highly recommend you this show!but please. don't get too attached to a certain character, because... valar morghulis."

2015-08-19,andrefellino,Drama of the Century,1,"finally, this is the show anyone wants to see. when i watched the first three episodes of game of thrones, i got disoriented easily because of the extremely wide scope of the stories. but as we watch more and more, this thing becomes the reason why we all carried on watching the show.many folks out there said that this show isn't particularly similar to the books, and they said that the show is deviated from the books, but this is really why we should watch it. if the show goes on exactly the same as the books, then the book readers have no reasons to waste their time on watching the show.of course, our gratitude should go to the mastermind, george r.r. martin, and the producers, dave benioff and dan weiss. they've made this show very interesting from episode to episode, and keep us watchers to be curious on whats gonna happen next."
2015-08-24,flyingosprey,Incoherent,9,"a. lacking cohesion : loose. b. lacking orderly continuity, arrangement, or relevance : inconsistent (an incoherent essay) c. lacking normal clarity or intelligibility in speech or thought.because this fault appears to have been deliberately built in by the screen writers and producers, possibly in order to extend the number of seasons over which the story is to be run, i can only rate this 3/10. without the built in incoherence, this could have lived up to it's 9+ rating.certainly the actors deserve as much, as i believe the acting to be superb."

2015-09-21,nektocrynos,Late to the game.,9,have been hearing all about this show so i finally thought i would see what it is like. have enjoyed the first season and glad i waited to watch so i can just binge an not have to wait to see what happens next.i always liked peter dinklage but he is killing it in this show. and i'm really looking forward to seeing what happens to tyrion lannister in the coming shows. i do hear there are so dragons coming and they seem to be teasing the hell out of them with those dragon eggs. hope there worth the wait and aren't a giant let down. when they do finally show up. nothing will be worse then waiting all this time to have a badly animated dragon pop on the screen.
2015-11-18,kingsharen,Truly addictive,10,this show is amazing it has an immense world that's ever growing. and it's unpredictable good watch most shows you can guess exactly where it's headed not this one. the story will draw you in to a world that you can't get enough of. i haven't read the books thou i'm tempted but i love to absorb the story through the show. you will get deeply involved with the characters and the world. i guess what my point is the series is one of the best things i've ever seen on tv i am truly addicted and am very excited for the next season. gorge e.r martin is a literary genius and hbo did a fantastic amazing job bring his work to life. my only complaint is i always want more.
2019-05-24,zohaib-86245,Disaster,1,we should learn from this all that how it feels to see someone doing their finest work on a painting but in the end sh£t on it and ruin it because the thing is that at the end final look matter's they totally ruined it.will nave recommend this show to anyone in the future.

2017-09-17,almuttplay,season 7 was quite disappointing,10,"i have to say this is the best show i have ever seen, and i am big fan of got but i was disappointed after i finished season 7, it wasn't like the seasons before, i used to see fights wars betrays good men got killed game changing kinda stuff, at this season yes there was a couple of fights and for sure a lot of enthusiasm but did't really like the ending, i can say that the whole season 7 was just an introduction for season 8, which now we have to wait long time to watch plus it will be sadly the final, which i really hope that there will be more to come."

2015-10-19,sterlingguilherme,A review for the Game Of Thrones series,10,"game of thrones is a fantasy/drama series produced by hbo and was first released in 2011. it has quickly grown to the most watched television series. it's adapted from george r.r. martin's series a song of ice and fire. there are 5 seasons to date and the sixth is set to be released april 2016. seventeen years prior to when the series began, lord robert baratheon and lord eddard stark start a civil war to unseat the targaryen mad king. they succeed and robert rules as king ever since, but the series opens when his rule is starting to be undermined by other factions. on the other side of the world, two targaryen royals have grown into adults and are planning to return to their kingdom and take the iron throne. while betrayal and civil war are becoming very real, to the north, jon snow (lord eddard stark's bastard son) has joined the night's watch and lives on the wall, a seven hundred foot wall of ice that borders the north, defending the realm against wild men and white walkers (literally snow zombies). the main themes for the series are, a struggle for power, violence, the corruption of money, and loyalty.first things first, game of thrones is meant for an adult audience. there is a lot of swearing, a lot of sex, and most of all, a lot of violence scenes that either made me look away, or made me feel sick. however, these things are what make game of thrones such an amazing and enticing show. first of all, game of thrones is big on politics. you will constantly be rooting for certain characters, trying to predict what will happen, and you will feel so close to the action. only to find out that next episode, your favorite character dies, the complete opposite of what you thought would happen, happens, and as you feel so close, you're ripped away due to a despicable antagonist who has no heart. game of thrones make politics almost romantic. there is one rule in game of thrones. do not get attached to a character. this show is ripe with death. game of thrones is brutal. frow literal jaw dropping moments, to gut wrenching scenes, the blood and gore is plenty. from majestic sword fights, to pulse racing execution scenes, you will always be on the edge of your seat. one thing that this show does, is it makes you uncomfortable. not in a way that makes you want to stop watching, but in a way that makes you feel like you're in the same situation as the characters.an upside and a big downside to game of thrones is that it can be a frustrating show. there are some brave and fierce characters, however, other characters (like sansa and aria stark) seem to never do anything useful but get captured or end up screwing other characters over, your favorite characters are sometimes left out of an episode, and characters choose to keep important information from each other that could end situations quickly. however, this happens in most tv series and just goes to show what great writing and acting is put into the show.game of thrones has, and will be one of the most popular tv series for a long time, and for good reasons.the show is beautiful, complex and rewarding as well as most of all, entertaining. as we wait for more seasons to come out, if feels as though winter is coming. . ."
2015-10-22,briansorigin,"Predictable, Old, Nothing to Root For",8,"really wasn't very interesting. i'd recommend not wasting your money on watching it if you can avoid it. the characters are great actors, but the plot line is actually very basic in the end. good guy wants justice, bad guy wins. with so many stories of so many kingdoms, one would think something decent and happy was going on. granted, they pop a wedding or two in now and then, but even those end up in massacre and death. so...i end my review with explaining the next chapters of the game: part 1 , good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. part 2 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. part 3 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. part 4 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. part 5 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. get the point?"
2015-10-22,joeyfazunila,freakn' awesome,1,"it was a nice tv series for me. the last tv series i watched are knight rider and mcguyver and it was a very very very long time ago. the actors and actresses from this series are magnifecently great and im glad that the other actors and actresses are given a chance to show their talents and craft not like our celebrities here in the philippines, they used the same celebrity over and over again. their character will be dead on the next episode because they are doing another role in other tv series in the same studio. but i noticed some problem game of thrones, why the director or writer they frequently changed what is already happened in the books."

2015-11-24,pokanik,"disgusting, overrated, pointless",5,"game of thrones must be the most overrated show i've ever seen. i've suffered through 5 season of this garbage so far and i simply cannot understand why anyone would ever like this show. you can sum up the whole show in one word: violence. this show basically shows people get physically and emotionally tortured and killed for five seasons. that's it. nothing else is happening. they're trying to make it look like a political thriller full of intrigue, betrayal and plot twists. but it's not. all the scheming and colluding the characters do leads to nothing, because they all eventually get tortured and brutally killed. there is no action, there are no battles, there is no strategy, there is no mystery, there is no magic. although they keep promising all of that since s01e01. there's just pointless violence.watch this only if you've already watched every other show ever made ever."
2019-06-14,sumocopter,Final season ruined the whole series.,9,it was one of the best series ever made until the final season. season 8; it ruined everything. 😡
2016-06-19,buxiangkan,Violent Porn is no Substitute for Creativity,1,"game of thrones is an intricate and interesting story that thrives off of shock, titillation, and disgust. it brings out the worst of human emotions within the characters and is a poor influence on the minds of its watchers (people who mostly just want an epic fantasy). the attention that this series has gained is an unfortunate reflection on our society. while i can understand the allure of such an expansive world with many amazing qualities of a good fantasy, i cannot personally support a series that makes light of nudity, women, rape, and violence. my rating is for the quality of the story as well as the cinematography. i hope that people everywhere will recognize the effects that this series has on their thoughts and emotions as they become immersed in this filth. i also hope that parents will recognize the importance of avoiding bringing these sorts of influences into the home."
2015-12-02,mutazbawaneh,the secret lies in its uniqueness,6,"i think the show really captures its audience, not through cgi dragons and mystical lands and what not, but through the idea of power and what it can do. the show captures the evolving nature of characters facing hard choices that call for even harder decisions, for example the evolving of daenerys's character throughout the whole show is by itself a good reason to keep watching the show, and this could really apply to everyone else. this is an important asset that we do not see that often with shows nowadays, most shows are focusing on attracting the audience rather than building a solid storyline to carry through the show. when i first watched got, i got hooked fast, because i was just bored watching the same ideas over and over again ( cops shows, medical crew shows, housewives shows, detective shows) definitely one of my all time favorite shows."
2018-04-10,fcbfcbfcb-74063,Latterly the best TV show ever,2,"this show is simply awesome the plot is interesting
the charcters are amazing
the cast are the best"
2019-05-20,trudeausucksdick,Season 8,10,"worse ending, season, ever. rushed, made no sense. 8 years for absolutely nothing."
2019-05-20,rohitshanker,A solid ending to a almost perfect show,10,"after the season finale, i feel like i need to share my honest opinion for this show.ever since season 8 came out, it is being bombed with negative reviews, i understand the reason and i agree with some of it. i personally think that this season was more close to the life. life is unexpected, unfair and i think this season proves just that.i think the show ended on a good note. as i said earlier ""life is unfair"" seems to be the most prominent in the last episode where everyone's fate is decided for one last time on the screen.for me, a solid ending to the show. i am glad that they went out of the way, taking risk with the writing for the last episode, knowing that most people wouldn't like it. it added to the unexpected."
2015-12-18,sandipandas,Picture Perfect,10,"firstly, you're better off watching the show and seeing for yourself than reading this review. however, if you still want to, you can go on. i really don't care if the show's storyline deviates from the books. what keeps me hooked to the show is the superb pace and detail that is associated with each of the parallel story lines. each storyline is handled delicately and a viewer will seldom feel a bias towards a particular one. every character exhibits true human character and is not just a vessel for reciting the script. for me, every character scores top marks in every department. also, you can't forget the setting and the scenery. their selection immensely affect the atmosphere of a scene giving it way more definition. the least that i can say about this show is that it is an intense work of art. to conclude, this show is just about perfect and i bet it will be the one to beat for quite some time down the line in its genre."

2019-05-24,deandeluca,What a send off.,10,i've watched this show from day dot. told all my friends about it and they've joined the ride. never read the novels so wasn't sure what to expect. what an epic roller coaster of a show this was. makes me want to actually buy the novels now to see if i have actually missed anything. to be honest not the ending i would have liked to have seen. but a good ending none the less. i would like to say thank you to everyone involved. you have made me look forward to your show every week.
2019-05-20,hakeemfrazier,If you haven't seen it yet...,10,don't bother watching season 8. it's a waste of your time.
2019-05-22,gabrielstroid,Dont thing im gonna miss this show after watching the finale,9,"loved the first 6 seasons, season 7 was good but i truly wish i hadn't seen the last season. everything was rushed, most things made no sense, bad character development and it left me with a bad taste. in episode 3 of season 8 there was not enough lighting, the way the night king went down was really frustating especially after his true intentions were never shown.i miss i really hope for a miracle to happen from hbo to remake the last season. dan and david are the real villains in this show."
2019-05-17,suzana_sevic,It WAS the best show,10,"got was all about 1. no plot armor 2. no one is only evil or good, everyone has its motives. 3. decisions and consequences, based on logic, which means, no surprises for the sake of shock value. 4. intelligent, witty dialogues and character development. story was important. 5. intelligent tactics & strategies.now its all about emotional drama with no real logical basis, plot armor & stupid decisions and twists. throwing away most of the prophecies and leaving the audience with no real explanations just for the sake of shock value. 7 seasons wasted on set ups, which didn't pay off. what a joke.d&d should never get any writing job again! they succeded in ruining the best show. congratulations! sorry grrm."
2016-05-04,victoriagigante-30856,They are back! Jon Snow is alive!,1,"it is such a beautiful and uplifting twist seeing jon snow coming back to life! it is getting more exciting and really can't wait for more episodes. the strong characters of every individual role complement each other which will hook you up till the end. jon snow is the hot topic at the comeback of season 6. he's presence making a positive view from the audience. his vital contribution to the whole story is really needed and you can't get him out. the fact that the previously very,dead jon snow is now very not-dead on game of thrones is perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in the show's six-year history. but that didn't stop the production team from trying to keep his return under wraps—and they went to some pretty crazy lengths to do so, like banning his name.game of thrones is now getting powerful, vibrant, exciting, and the game is always on!"
2021-05-12,serj_tank,FROM HERO TO ZERO !!,10,i was a huge fan since earlier seasons and every season was truly a master piece until season 7 i rated it 10/10 because it was perfect in all ways.but .... the ending ruined it all idk if it will be the ending in the books but the way they applied it was so fast and a lot of contradictions here and there so 3/10 is well deserved in my opining ... really disappointed & i'm sure mr george is too !
2019-04-29,jnetofrota,Its a Masterpiece Till the Last Two Seasons,9,"s08ep03 truly bad/lazy writing, no explanation at all to how arya got there, who the night king is, what he wants, nothing. features all the cliches that block busters have, basically is the best series off all time till george rr martin leaves it on the six season, from there is just lazy writing and proving that a high budget and good storyline is no excuse for producers to ruin it all for money, i will stil give 10/10 cause it was so f*cking awesome at the first 6 seasons."
2016-01-05,kibula,"stories about the sides of light and dark sides of man's mind,",10,"i delayed watching this show for a long time. and i regret it. it has to be the best shows out there. acting is superb, plot is good too. and, shock value is extreme. some people complain that their favorite characters are getting killed. but this is what makes them different from other shows. its unpredictability is its usp.seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of westeros. this is what the plot in short is. we come to see betrayals, seduction, secrets, loyalty etc. there are a lot of people who complain about nudity, but there is not that much. but yes its show meant for the adults. every season comes up with new twists and turns. i finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks. and now looking forward to the 5th season. 10/10 for me."
2016-01-27,marlidiz,"The Very Best, Complex Show I have Ever Seen!",10,"i love the cinematography and the actors in it. the story is amazing & the way they did their plot is very complex and interesting!!!!!! love it! i can't wait to watch the other episodes since i haven't seen the rest! but, i know it's good! i am thrilled that your typical knights & shining armor story is so vividly entertaining & gives a different element to the viewer. 100 thumbs up if i can! i can't wait to watch the next episodes. your show is the hit and i will watch this over and over again. everything is well done and made! why i think this show is hands,down? i will tell you why. it gives off the suspense in the right time and right moment. i will say, they did a very, pretty good job!"
2019-05-30,majoroswald-21607,Blah,5,did not conclude well at all i think john wick should be sent for d.b. weis and david benioff.
2019-04-16,fdparell,The first and (probably) sadly the last of his kind,9,"top many words have been spent by reviewing this epic serie. however the best part is the perfect mix of joy, cruelty and hope. the empty feeling of seeing die the best characters who we have been used to love has been seen as a frustrating act by many but that's the key and it didn't accidentally happen"
2019-05-21,senthilkumargoms,Game of thrones one of my favourite TV series ever,10,it's been an epic journey for me since the #got first episode and i was expecting much more at the #finalseason but i'm partially convinced by the end but that didn't fulfilled my all about #got whatever thanks to entire #got team and especially to #georgemartin
2019-05-20,salomezarandia,Ending..,10,"everything for nothing! characters who were trying hard and were working their asses off to achive something got in the end nothing and some random characters who were just ""lucky"" to survive they got everything for what athers died and risked everything about.... worse ending cant be written. but no justice at all how most of the times...."
2016-02-27,galinamore,just plain awful,10,"people, are you ok to like it? i can't believe my eyes when i see this rating. how come? the lunatic plot? the sadistic enjoyment of unnecessary deaths and brutally? the frequency of nude bodies made me feel i was in public bath or better say in meat department. oh, yes, how could i forget... false a la medieval theme decorations tat surrounded this bull ... this story is teenagers, who suffer from suppressed sexuality and dreaming about crazy revenge he will make on his classmates, who bully him everyday. everything is very dark and depressing and all he can do is to build the fantasy kingdom, to hide himself behind the tall walls and enjoy, enjoy beating his enemies and humiliation of queens.sad story. to enjoy this bull, the viewers have to share the same mentality that how it feels and how it looks. 2,5 is too much."
2019-05-22,alraisi-72635,The best show ever!!!!,10,the best show ever don't listen to anyone who says it's not good show it's the best from season 1 to season 7 are the best season 8 was trash but it remains the best show in history!!!
2019-02-05,solankitushar-84570,Nothing tops this,10,"whether you hate this or love this there is no middle ground. first two seasons are just ok because it takes time for you to remember large cast names and adapt to show's complexity . but after 3rd season the show is very interesting with some phenomenal action , gruesome and shocking scenes this show is a benchmark in today's television era"
2016-01-24,dautsadikoviq,Great addicting story.,1,"game of thrones has a great and addicting storyline. multiple characters with their own storyline that goes in depth. even the misses who isn't a fan of fantasy like story's at all is in love with the show. started reading the books because of the show. the best thing the story does is making you think that certaing things won't happen or that the story is impossible to evolve into something else from certain points. and yet you keep getting surprised and the storyline keeps evolving and getting better and better. besides the gread in depth story lines of the characters, the actors really know to play out the character. afther you watched the first season it won't take long before you have watched everything. please do yourself a favor and start watching game of thrones."

2019-05-15,spolak-59278,Season 8 is a disappointment,4,don't get me wrong this is still the best serie ever. but i agree with the rest season 8 is so rushed. the dialogues that make this serie so great are just rushed or are non existing in season 8.
2019-07-24,hhmhayes,"S 1-6 10/10, S 7 8/10, S 8 2-3/10",10,pretty much as said. this show was probably one of the best if the best show on tv until around season 7. and season 8 why oh why. it's sad because i loved this show so much and then season 8s awful writing (i won't say ruin it but definitely can't watch reruns without thinking about the bad ending. but other than that the first 6 seasons were almost perfect and won't fail you. until you get utterly disappointed.
2019-06-01,hariskalim,GOT could've been alot better!,10,"season 8 the first 2 episodes were good suspenseful however i cant say that for the rest of the season because things began to take place suddenly and the poor writing was one of the many problems in this season. season 1,7 were the greatest in my opinion in terms of writing, direction, suspense, and drama"

2016-04-27,kskatreg,Greatest TV Series of all Time,10,"game of thrones!!! loosely based on the english war of roses, writer martin added many outside elements to create an awe,inspiring fantasy series. his books were adopted into tv series.it is the political story about an in-power family and other noble families in the fantasy land of westerros to control the continent.this series is full of twists and turns and it is hard to fit this in a particular genre. many moves were not on the expected lines with new surprises in every episode.the directors leave each and every season at cliff hangers and audience has to wait almost an year to know the fate of their favorite characters.it hold an imdb rating of 9.5 as of now (end of season 5), which by no means a smaller achievement. the rating it hold in imdb tells it all!!!"

2019-05-20,buingocminh,It should be a 10/10,10,season 8 takes it down to 9. i don't think it's a bad ending but the way the creators of the show rush to it makes it a total disaster.
2016-03-19,calv-20438,Drop Dead Gorgeous!,1,"i've watched countless shows over the years, but game of thrones is the show that impacted me the most. it's an obsession and in my opinion it is literally the best show ever made! from the characters to the plot, from the huge world to every little backstory, everything is just so amazing. its hard to describe in words. game of thrones isn't afraid to challenge its viewers to hang on while it twists and turns like an angry beast, you will be challenged, but if you are able to endure, you will be in for one heck of a ride. the world of westeros has consumed me, i think about game of thrones even when i'm busy doing other things, this is the first time a tv show or movie has done this to me. watch this show, if you are a fan of fantasy, i guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!"

Shows ever.,7,"it's an amazing show.my friends keep telling me that it is a must watch.i watched it recently.i feel really bad for not watching it earlier.my friends also told me that it might seem not so good initially during 4 or 5 episodes.so,i started watching it at a weekend and oh my god,i can't stop myself after i get into it.i ate only 2 times in a day.i completed full 5 seasons in 3 days..watching it even midnight.it literally blows away my mind. peter dinklage(imp) is my favorite character.but all characters are detailed.the seems like it really exist.theme music is great. when jon snow died,i was like wtf.but i think he had a contract for few more seasons so it's no wonder if he comes back...maybe with the help of red lady. white walkers seems something out of this world..but they seems quite amazing in the show.when night's king,on his horse over the mountain, looked jon snow,it gave me a chill in my spine..that's the best moment for me. hbo has done a great work.it's better than movies. can't wait for season 6...a must watch show."

2011-10-09,patrick-deman2-1,Disappointing in any way...,10,"i didn't read the book, nor did i ever heard of it. second; i watched the first 6 episodes so far most reviews are mainly positive, but many of those are written by the book readers. if one feels that you have to read the book to enjoy the series this review is not for you.this series is a drag. i think thats the best way to describe it. its a never ending introduction of people whom may become important later or whom may not, you don't know for sure. its about intrigue, backstabbing, leadership, honor, good, evil all that.. but it doesn't deliver. some things happen, and if it does the show will definitely let you know ""something"" happened. even if its not that special it will become the main part of the story for to long.six episodes is almost 6 hours, nothing 'epic'/'grand' happened. all six hours is talk and no show. you might see a sword fight or two (not much more), but no battles or some breath holding scenes. even those who love this series cannot deny this. there are no real scenes in it, which will 'take you away', in lack of better words.so far, to me, this is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. you keep switching from story line to story line, and although they are put together nicely it just gets boring after an hour or 4. once again i'd like to state that nothing really happens.conclusion!?each episode has some brutal fighting with someone beheaded or loosing their eye before dying. it looks like an awful clone of mk fatalities. then out of the blue there's sex and swearing. i mean, what the freak?!!! what makes you people rank this 9.5 of 10? it is lousy and pathetic... i'm sorry, this series just sucks..."
2019-05-25,raghadab-76880,one of the best shows out there,10,even though season 8 was a mess but still the show has a place in my heart i will miss it so much :(
2016-04-05,craiggrantham-96071,Must watch,10,i heard a lot of people say this was good. i put of watching it for months and wish i never. it is the best series i have ever watched ever i love it. it takes a while to remember all the names of people and to remember who they are working for. do not watch it if you do not like blood and violence because there is a lot and don't watch if easily offended as there is a lot of sexual content in every episode nearly. i must say it has a excellent story line and keeps you wanting more and more every episode. some characters you grow to love and some you really hate them and i mean hate but that comes from the superb acting. game of thrones is fantastic.

2019-05-13,connorjbarr,"Seasons 7 & 8 should've been extended, because what we have is just rushed.",10,"game of thrones has established rules, travelling across westeros is a multiple episode feat, but nah lets teleport them around whenever we need them to be somewhere. maybe they've discovered all the locations now, hence the fast travel. also motivations, is another facet that takes time and also decent writing to seem genuine and not forced.this episode, i feel was a bit better than the disaster that was episode 4, but what's really holding this season back is honestly the writing. you've heard everyone talk about how it's rushed, and how plot elements have shifted dramatically to suit the end goals the writers have. it really is the case here. daenerys' flip to a tyrant doesn't feel justified, and the past episodes this season haven't fleshed out this change well at all. she wasn't always a noble ruler, but making the choice to torch all of kings landing, just seems like a plot device to push the 'targaryen cycle', the writers want to use for some reason.visually, this episode succeeds for the most part. the vast carnage going on is impressive for tv. it's clear the season was shortened to have grander episodes, with more demanding cgi sequences. i honestly felt we should have had more in between to help flesh out and build up to the decisions, made in these grander episodes. plot convenience is also getting stronger as we etch towards the end, drogon can apparently dodge, as well as wipe out all the ships and balistas with ease, makes you think why he couldn't accomplish this last episode. i could go on and on with little things that make this an underwhelming climax to some long time plotlines we've become so invested with all these years.btw the leaks for this episode were true, meaning the ending we're heading for does not look promising in the slightest."
2016-06-21,matzemiller,Masterpiece,10,"i just can not believe how good this series is. excellent actors, excellent dialogues, unbelievably good story,line, sets, costumes, atmosphere, camera, cuts, music etc, etc, etc. i am normally not a person who writes reviews for something but i just watched episode 9 from season 6. i had tears in my eyes, i was screaming in front of my monitor and i was totally exhausted after watching this cinematic masterpiece.i could have tried to write a very objective and proffesionall review about this series but at the end it is a highly emotional experience watching such perfectly made series like game of thrones."
2019-06-04,marymarysterd,Annoying final season.,3,"season 7 and 8 made remove two of ten stars. illogical scenes, things done in a rush, d&d are probably going to do some garbage with stars wars too since they don't have any book or something to inspire their work."
2019-08-06,siddiqmas,Great begining worst ending,9,i'm not going to review totally disappointed because of throne
2019-05-22,tahakhairy,best TV show ever,10,"no matter what i say, i can't describe how great is this show. basically, game of thrones is the best tv show of all time."
2020-04-15,daniel_fischermann,Outstanding - till season 7,10,"season 1,5 is outstanding. season 6 is good. season 7 was not great but also not terrible. season 8 was quit terrible and probably ruined the long term reputation for the series unfortunately."
2018-10-27,kthibeau,Awesome,10,are usually don't even watch tv and i downloaded hbo now and i paid for a subscription because i had heard that game of thrones was so good so i started watching it and i binged from season one to season seven it is the best show i've ever watched. i've never had a tv show draw me in and keep my attention for so long awesome awesome awesome .
2019-06-28,youssef_sasuke,Best show,10,you all are just overreacting dude. sorry my review is short... dont bother reading the rest lololol
2016-07-03,itrinium,"Absolutely epic, until the start of Season 5",10,"in my honest opinion, seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 were a masterpiece of cinematography, acting and storytelling, but something has now gone drastically wrong.season 5 was downright boring and season 6 has not fared much better, taking about 8 episodes to get into is stride and bouncing around locations almost aimlessly like a broken pinball machine.i am beginning to wonder if the author has lost interest in this huge undertaking or if there been a change of scriptwriter? based upon the first 4 seasons i would have easily scored 9\10, but the huge disappointments of the latter seasons makes me ""with regret"" reduce this to 6/10"
2019-05-24,sulan-29645,The best show ever,10,bad ending doesn't ruin the whole great moments we saw.
2019-05-12,ninsunaziz,"Dear HBO, Benioff, and Martin: You've saved my life (and attention span)",10,"i'm a student. i have a study leave of about a week and half. what do i decide to do? listen to the betrayals, wisdoms, and everlasting drama in the background while i struggle to revise. but let me tell you, i have no regrets whatsoever.game of thrones was something i'd been struggling with for about 2 years now: the whole nudity thing doesn't fare well with someone of my religious background, and yet i was in love with the terrifyingly dazzling world that martin had spun with words. it felt like a never,ending conflict, until a month ago:i found a censored version!that was my happily ever after- for a while, at least- until i realised that thrones is coming to a bittersweet, albeit fiery, end, and i've come to a conclusion these past few days:i cannot and will not live in a world where i can no longer look forward to seeing emilia clarke going from the beautiful daenerys whose heart must have been forged from the finest gold, to the stunningly fierce khaleesi who will burn down anybody standing in her path of greatness (both metaphorically and literally), or watching maisie williams' stone-faced arya plan five million steps ahead of every single baelish and night king there is in westeros, or witness sophie turner embody the ever-growing wisdom and beauty of sansa stark as she makes her own mark (or should i say claw?) on the world, or even just watch kit harington's snow reluctantly rise to greatness.that's only 4 characters. if i carry on with the others, we'd be here all day, as if i haven't kept you long enough.i'm just saying: hbo better start mining for new gems, and fast, because i'm not sure i can speak for all thrones fans, but i certainly can't and won't live in a world without the mightiness of a game of thrones."
2016-08-01,stefanhagenbinder,"exceptional first 4 season, season 5 and 6 lost track",1,"well, i really enjoyed the first 4 seasons. some interesting characters and also character development within credible plots and some twists. at first i didn't like game of thrones and needed a second attempt to watch it. once i get into the world of got i really like how the story was told and only a few faults i noticed. with the start of season 5 and continuation in season 6 the show lost me, just a few good scenes and developments. i didn't read the books, just started the first one. and i think the tv show writers did a good job on the original material by grrm. well, till they come to season 5 and 6. in season 6 they speed up some story lines and i don't really care about most characters, how can i if i see them only a few moments in a season? now the characters don't develop (no time for that) anymore, they just have to operate. and the writing lost it's subtle brilliance, but we get a better production value instead. i don't want to spoil and go into details, but there a some plot developments and character actions which are just poorly written, but it looks great. obvious the makers switched focus, for me the show lost it's high value and there are better shows to watch but as i can see among my friends and reactions on the internet most people agree with the show and where it is going. for me just the bran plot line could be interesting in the future and also the white walker part and the rest seems to be predictable. in the sixth season i started reading fan theories and reviews and found more interesting plot developments among the fans than the actual tv writers. to give it a rating: 8 of 10 because of the first 4 seasons, for season 5 and 6 i would give a 6 and 7 (of 10)."
2019-05-20,donnajefferson,Season 8 The worse,10,this season was rushed with only 6 episodes. the finale was the worse ever. i'm sorry i spent the last 8 years watching game of thrones. piss poor writing.
2019-06-16,megahobbes,Great show except most of the final seasons,5,"i'm not saying the ending was bad, but it was sloppy and rushed when compared to the subtle build up of prior seasons. it might not worth becoming invested in such a long series with such a bland and mediocre end. beyond that as a whole it gives a great new take on fantasy television and what the potential could be for future programming (minus the final season of course)."
2019-06-12,jortmanshanden,"A beautiful piece of art, even season 8",1,"sure making season 7 and 8 both 10 episodes long would've helped, but this show is the best piece of entertainment i've seen in my life.ending a show as popular as game of thrones is the hardest thing there is, but i believe it was done brilliantly here. the show has you on the edge of your seat until the very last moment, and there are tears on your face until the very last moment.
i didn't expect dany to become a mad queen and loved it, i also loved that in the end, everyone that's left gets to the place where they're supposed to be. it's a true ending that really satisfied me.the music in this show never failed to give me goosebumps, the acting never failed to shower me in emotions. the directing as good/better than the highest rated hollywood blockbusters. the writers had some missed opportunities, but they made up for that by having amazing twists and brilliant dialogue.
the mind of george is incredible.finally to give a list of seasons from best to worst in my opinion:
1. season 4
2 & 3. season 3 & 6
4. season 1
5. season 2
6 & 7. season 5 & 8
8. season 7thanks everyone involved to make this beautiful piece of art."
2019-01-11,andrewreidar,Such a great show.,3,"has great battles, and the suspense of anyone of the characters can die at anytime. during a battle you never know who can die."
2016-07-31,slowshows,"An Outstanding , Unique and Truly Magnificent Series",1,"this has to easily be the best show that i have ever watched , the setting is perfect . acting is just simply outstanding and the development of characters and settings as you progress through the series is what truly grips you , even the cgi is spectacular, much more defined and well balanced than other shows.. as you start off watching the show it takes time for the ambiance and setting of the series to sink in so that you can get easily accumulated every time you start watching again , a whole other world you sink into ; as you progress through the show you start to root for different characters and houses. the best thing is that there is no actual villain in the series but instead different houses that take people on different journeys. the only flaw i see for miles is the fact that there are only 10 episodes per season because once you start , you won't be able to stop yourself from wanting more and more...."
2019-04-29,ittarekamin,Sure amazing,10,"i have to admit that, what i have seen on this series equal to the top 100 moved all together. even it may prevent me from waiting any other series as i will never seen the same level of producation and filming that has been done on game of thrones. really really apprecated for exciting us."
2019-05-06,vikrant-53977,Boring,9,this series is most confusing and boring series and useless.
2020-01-03,joannegoodwin,Definitely my favourite series of all time,7,"perfect 👌 spot on #got. i envy anyone who has never seen a single episode of thrones because potentially you have all this to look forward to. for me unfortunately my time is up. phenomenal. this series sets itself apart from any other; the score, the dialogue, the acting, the effects, cinematography, it's all in a different class to any other series out there. sometimes it's hard to believe that this is a series and not a blockbuster oscar winning picture. it's a masterpiece. is it possibly the best series of all time???
""ask me again in 10 years."""
2019-05-24,dasilva_steven,Amazing show until season 8,10,this has been the most amazing show i have watched. i would wait and wait for the episode to come on. after season 7 i was excited to start this again and then huge disappointment. everything happened so fast and the ending was terrible. ruined it for me and many others.
2020-04-25,marianela-02278,The egomaniac(s) that made Bad season 8/ finale decisions,10,did you fire the writers for season 8 and wing it?? john snow's character was consistent through and through. he would have never killed her! the dragon queen wasn't supposed to be mad. she would not have burned the town. aria was the master killer. she was supposed to kill beautifully at the end. it seems like all your viewers that hate the ending knew the characters better than you and could have written the end to a masterpiece now ruined probably by some selfish multi millionaire ego(s). redo it. get the writers back and make it right!
2016-08-17,shivangiagrawalk,Why the World needs Game of Thrones?,10,"i've never read the books. (this post may contain spoilers)so if you're anything like me, you're going to want to hold on for well the ride of your life. trust me, you've never seen anything like it. get ready to have your mind blown and keep the tissues ready. oh yeah, you're gonna need them. (even you, boys) the world of westeros and essos was a complete mystery that took my breath away as it carefully, strategically and most of all enchantingly unwind,ed with every episode. you see, george, dan & david are all very smart. do not underestimate their tenacity with which they deliver to us the most brutally honest and fascinating stories of these multifaceted and extraordinary characters.oh the things they will do for - love, honor, duty, power and the list goes on. i'm not going to tell you anything specific about the show, because going in not knowing anything is the best way to experience game of thrones. i didn't know anything and thank god for that! it really was love at first sight.(i really do wish i could experience the magic once again)enjoy every second of the brilliance! get ready to love and hate the world of game of thrones! when you play the game of thrones, you either win or you die. brace yourselves because winter is coming!valar morgulis!"
2019-05-14,elsaweymohamed,The part is Weak,8,"the part is very bad , the action is quickly and understand"
2019-05-20,aviralpandey-62608,#Gameofthrones_bestever,6,"neither there has been a greater show like that , nor will there ever be ! no matter how we judge finale season but we will never come close to have a show like that 🙌💯
dont criticize for the ending but praise for the journey 💕
we should be thankfull to them to get to witness such breathtaking 8 seasons♥
thankyou !!"
2019-04-29,juliegayomandam,I was a cynic too.,8,i was a cynic too. didn't watch it until season 4. just one episode and then you're hooked. just give it a try. you'll understand why this is the best tv show ever.
2019-05-21,ameerhajyehia,not good,10,"nahhh this is not enough good cant be at the best.
only breaking bad"
2019-05-21,greinjulian,Excellenz Show with a sligtly weaker Last Season,10,"while everyone was afraid of a disaster, the last episode is in my opinion a worthy and surprisingly round ending to an incredible show. the amount of hate it gets is absolutely unjustified."
2019-05-07,ladybast-79898,"Could be great, if the writers didn't hate women",10,rape isn't the only way to develop a female character. i love fantasy and dragons and read all the books but i'm done with this show.
2019-05-12,com-16454,Gooooood should I do with my kids tonight,8,good yes please call him when you can call you and see how it went

2019-05-20,acbrown-25610,Finale was awful,10,i don't think they could have chosen a worse finale for a show that was so awesome for so many years. recently i thought avengers endgame was poorly written but at least they made up for it with a good ending.
2016-09-22,ranjith-42857,fantastic,7,"awesome series i have ever watched the series is set on the fictional continents of westeros and essos and interweaves several plot lines with a large ensemble cast. the first narrative arc follows a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the iron throne of the seven kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from it; the second covers the attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the rising threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the north. game of thrones has attracted record numbers of viewers on hbo and attained an exceptionally broad and active international fan base. it has received widespread acclaim by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity, violence, and sexual violence has attracted criticism."
2020-02-08,mohamadturkmany,I miss Game of Thrones,8,i know how bad it ended and all of that but still now monthes after it ended i greatly miss the show and the chills i felt watching a new episode. :.(
2019-05-21,lenelund,Best show ever,5,"i love this entire world. the people, the plots. but for your own sake. just stop watching after s8e3. this will be for the best. i promise."
2017-07-29,sahitidas,A Stunner!!!!,10,"game of thrones is and will be the best show ever made in the history of television. the mere commitment of the show runners to give their audience the best possible viewer experience is really commendable. the way each character unfolds and how well the plot is spun around these characters is simply admirable. this is the only show worth waiting for after completion of every season. and mind you, it does deliver every time that it returns for the new season. i just hope i get to watch many such shows in future."
2019-05-22,derbyss,About season 8...,9,"while the last season was extremely rushed,the show as a whole was one of the best ever.some of season 8's episodes we might argue were ""ok"",but episode 4 and especially 6,the ending were...awful. i still hope they listen to the petition about remaking the season(almost at 1.5mil signatures),everyone worked so hard,but the writers pretty much ruined everything.let's not forget about how awesome the other seasons are,even if 8 is,well,a disappointment because of the ending and a few other things"
2019-07-24,sharmapuneet-02609,Season 8 was not good at all.,9,"i would rate it 10. but season 8 was very disappointing. idk why they did this to all of us, making such great seasons throughout the series and when all were expecting (with high hopes) the final season to be of next level . they disappointed us."
2020-08-30,classicalguss,You can tell when they ran out of George RR Martin material,8,"first 4 seasons were the best tv i ever watched. season 5 was okay, season 6 was okay as well with one outstanding episode. now season 7 is where the writers didn't know what they hell they were doing and turned it into a disney film, or worse a superhero franchise. season 8 was more like an unfunny sitcom. sure it had some plot going on, but the execution was terrible and left fans not just disappointed, but very angry to the point of making a ridiculous petition of re,writing the last season."
2017-08-19,georgzacharias,It don't have much content nor depth.,10,"i really don't know where to begin. i have a really big problem with the series. i'll try to show you what i mean. i hope that you will understand me.i had really high expectations, and the series really tried to disappoint me as good as they can. when i first heard of the series, i thought that it would be a epic series about many kingdoms who are fighting for the throne. but that's not what it is. the only person who really wants it is daenerys targaryen. the whole time i expected the next lord of the rings ,which is so epic!-, but in size of a series. and this is exactly not what happened. it isn't epic nor much fantasy like lotr. ok, we have a fictional world, 3 dragons, some giants and the white walkers. (the dire wolves aren't fictional. they lived 9,000 years ago) but that's it! the whole series is just a medieval series (or soft porn) set in a fictional world. the only thing it have is tits, gore and torture. none of the characters have any depth, so they aren't likable in any way. i don't care about just one of the characters. and a good character is the half of the story, right?it's merely a dumb, mindless, meaningless, but quite well made medieval series without any suspense nor depth. at least it have some kind of a cliffhanger in the end of every single episode. thats may be the reason for the whole not understandable hype. it's ok for a fantasy medieval series, but not good enough for something really amazing or mind blowing. lotr was so much better in every possible way.(it ... just bored me the whole time i watched it. and if you like it, i don't care. this is just my opinion on it)"
2019-05-21,amanchoraria,Love is stronger than hate,10,"this show has been the most engrossing show of all time for me . it has left a deep impact on my mind and heart which will be there forever . however ,the ending was not according to the show standards maybe because the bar was set too high during the previous seasons or maybe the writers ran out of source material .but we can't deny the fact that first 6,7 seasons were a masterpiece and we can't let season 8 ruin the happiness this series has given us . for me this show will be the greatest of all time despite poor season 8 writing as i cannot forget the last 6-7 beautifully crafted seasons which were perfection in themselves . i urge everyone not to hate this show because of its ending but to love it because of all it has given us throughout its journey. and no one can deny the fact that how great and engrossing the first 6 seasons were . i agree to the fact that season 8 has lot of plot-holes and plot armour but i wouldn't let that ruin my love for this show .
i hope every true fan understands this and stop spreading hate about this show ."
2019-05-20,abelpraiz,The show went down like that dragon,10,"i don't know how, this season was made in the first place,this season just ruined the whole show did they really read the script daam all the credits goes to the creator's"
2016-11-26,sachiendra,Inclusive of all cultures of the world,10,"it is an excellent series. however i am disappointed from the beginning that other cultures and colours are ignored. despite the globalization and uk being involved with different cultures thought out its history there is still selection and discrimination. we talk about gays and lesbians, women but none have the courage to use people of other cultures, colours in these neutral stories. humans have evolved in africa from a beggar to royalty and yet we find such barriers. i hope from now onwards over 50% of the cast belong to other civilization beyond uk. this is a sexually explicit series. it is raw and brutal at times but i have to commend the courage shown by the directors to portray this. this is perhaps how humans as animals behave in a world where power dominates. this is how tribes behave in isolated parts of the world. this is a universal law of nature before we became ""civilized"". yet such behavior persists amongst animal kingdoms."
2019-05-19,dark-n-wild,Season 8 is total garbage,6,"you had the potential make the series epic, but the writers are too greedy."
2019-05-21,teddrosh,Worst ending I've ever seen!,10,"d&d ruined what could have been the most epic and amazing tv series of all times. watch only the 1,6 seasons, don't bother with season 7 and season 8."
2018-07-28,fahadharby,Awesome,10,"the best tv show i ever seen, i love it so much........"
2020-12-26,kane_lol,From a favorite serie to something decent,10,"lets start with me saying that i was such a big fan of this show. i did find game of thrones unique. it had so much potential and so many ways to go.season 1,6 was so good.
season 7, didn't keep up with the rest of the seasons. it did felt abit rushed.
season 8, was such a big disappointment. cant believe how they managed to such bad writing. everything was rushed. so much of the story did seem unfinished. it felt like a big let down how they did write the story for many of the characters.this could have been a series which i would rewatch mulitple time. but unfortunately after last season, i could not bare to rewatch it. it went from a solid 10 to 8."
2018-08-29,cafacci_boutique,Greatest Tv Show of all time!!,9,i never read the books but i've enjoyed watching game of thrones from the very first second of the first episode till the last second of the episode and i can't wait for the season finale!!
2019-05-20,josephkistler,It's the greatest show ever,10,people need to lose their bias and understand that the finale was the greatest ever made i'm sorry
2017-02-26,aladdinjoha,Just a long boring porn story,7,"the goal is to periphrasis and deploy the immorality among families, and disseminate porn between relative as an usual act for normal humans in a typical commercial show.. however everyone knows those things happened in that era, but the show took that as an advantage to promote it when it could been done in an appropriate and more convenient way instead immorality. sorry but this is my opinion."
2019-06-23,kurt-63113,Amazing fantasy series!!,10,"regardless of the poor reviews of the last season. this is still up there with the best series of all time. i thoroughly enjoyed every season, even the last. if you are into fantasy don't hesitate to watch it. it's amazing"
2016-12-17,official_crc,Personal Opinion of Game of Thrones,8,"game of thrones is one of the greatest shows out there. it has an intriguing story filled with action, drama and suspense. a truly remarkable series. the characters are incredibly interesting allowing the spectator to establish a clear connection with them. moreover, the magical and supernatural elements the shows has are spectacular. the plot of the story is breathtaking which captivates the audiences interest within minutes of each episodes. although the first two seasons were good the seasons that followed were absolutely astonishing. overall, i recommend this tv show to anyone as it appeals to a large audience. lastly, i strongly believe that game of thrones is a work of art. it is one of my favorite tv shows and i am sure that whoever watches it will like it immensely."
2016-12-21,paul-37450,Addicting series,7,"bindge watched the entire series, and found it impossible to turn away. there is a character for everyone to get caught up in. it has all of the elements to keep even the most frugal audience riveted. i found multiple characters and story lines that captivated my viewing attention. every season has a great number of suspenseful plot turns that will most certainly surprise you. just when you think you know what will happen, things can change drastically. even when a character is perceived to be dead, there is always a chance that they can be saved through the wonders of witchcraft. the kingdoms battle each other, only to prepare for a battle of the ages with the white walkers. winter is surely coming, so be prepared to get beyond that wall and suited up for the war."
2020-07-31,partydean,"Incredible, engaging, enthralling story",9,just remake season 8 please. it's the best show i have ever watched. season 7 is still good but very different. without going too far into it i only watch a few shows. they are typically drawn out and have dumb plots to move the story forward. game of thrones is for people who dont even like tv. it's that good
2019-05-20,snipav,Great show except for the last season! Horrible ending!,10,"this is by far one if the best shows i've seen. however, the season 8 had very poor writing. horrible ending. a note to the writers, don't build and develop characters throughout all season and then just randomly make them insignificant. this show could e ended so much better with an amazing glorious ending. unfortunately the writers decided to be lazy and give us something unexpected that didn't work."
2018-09-15,kmrn-13940,Amazing,1,its good. that is all i have to say about it. ignore this im just trying to make it longer.
2019-05-05,brittanyjfrederick,Ridiculous ratings baised on the books.,10,i think it is totally absurd to rate this show baises on the books considering the fact that after season four there really wasn't one to go on. saying that it's nothing like the book is entirely unfair when not one show or movie baises on books ever entirely went 100% by a book anyway. if you want to complain because of lighting whatever the complaint is just pay attention to the title everything you want to complain about is nul invoid considering that this is the last season. i loved episode 3 i thought it kept with the story lines being set up ever since season one. i like how you saw everyone fighting for the living trying to do there best. for those who hate the outcome because of who we lost. you've been warned ever since season 1 not to fall in love with any of the characters.
2019-05-20,batoolashoor,Loved it till the end !,10,despite everything .. i loved this show till the last scene in the last episode of the last season .. by far it's the greatest show for me ..
2016-12-27,blackluster-93953,Epic Show,1,"absolutely amazing show. the thing that makes game of thrones so much better than any show i have ever watched is the story lines, in every episode there is about 3 main story lines going on while 1 or 2 side stories are also going on. so you have a variety of stories to look forward to. the next great thing about this epic show is the characters, there are so many characters on game of thrones that when i first watched i couldn't keep up with all the names. a hero can't be a hero without a villain and this show has some pretty messed up villains. like the boy king joffrey for example who terrorized westeros for 3 seasons, or the even crazier boltons who just love to skin people alive. for me this show has so many episode highlights but here are a few i'd say are what makes game of thrones the epic that it is. baelor, the rains of castamere, the watchers on the wall, hardhome, battle of the bastards, and the winds of winter. those are just episodes i consider a perfect 10 out of 10. although there are many other episodes that i'd say are pretty perfect as well. overall i give game of thrones a 10 out of 10 because of its variety of characters, it's multiple story lines per episode, and the epic battle scenes we see through the course of the show."
2019-05-17,fsuter,Did Marvel bought HBO?,10,"no comment, so disappointed... from grey it becomes black and white...
from surprise it becomes meaningless suspens...
from medieval fantastic it becomes heroic fantasy...
from genius tv show it becomes like any tv show, even worse..."
2019-05-21,harmy-59150,We waited almost two years for season 8...For total disappointment.,10,"i used to be a big fan of the show...until the train wreck, that was season 8. out with the nuances and in with shoddy dialogues, the poorly crafted storylines and the pacing.! huh! it feels like two different shows. the last season took so long to perfect... the cgi was perfect, the costumes, the sets were spot on spot on ( ahem.. the coffee cup and water bottle) but how about the story, the characters (which deserved better dialogues and better deaths.) the thought behind the actions of the characters was not clear and seemed like they just suddenly did random things without reason! the main battle was too dark to even comprehend which is weird as allegedly, more time was spent on it than any other battle in the series. what was the point if we couldn't see it! season 8 did no justice of tying up of loose ends, instead it shredded the story and characters. sad end to what was a epic story to begin with."
2019-05-21,pranavpatil-00404,Greatest Of All Time,10,one of the best show in history of television this show is great just watch it dont listen to negativity about last season just enjoy the show the writers has given the different ending and starks are finally ruling the kingdoms.

2019-04-23,aridin,Best ever,10,hands down best series ever no series can do better than this holy grail one
2019-05-20,janinehova,GOT deserved better,10,"season 1,7 were amazing and always kept everyone speechless. however, season 8 was a disappointment. not due to the sad events that took place, but due to the rushed episodes and bad writing. very disappointed in the last episode and the fact that it wasn't what the show deserved. got deserved better!"
2019-05-21,sinazahmatkeshan,ending,10,the end of the good series must be awosone but this ending was like sh.t ridin baba
2017-02-19,alexfurfaroseo,Riviting Show that keeps you guessing,10,"game of thrones has been a favorite show of mine since it came out with season one. i happen to catch a few episodes with my sister whom had hbo at the time and i was hooked ever since. the first season i remember how difficult it seemed to keep straight names, places, etc since everything was so new but the depth and detail that is described just kept me that much more interested. the twists and turns the show takes with every season there being a gut,wrenching ""oh my god"" moment. season four was a little slow but otherwise i've been very impressed. i look forward to this season coming out in a few short months!"
2019-05-09,ana_nanevska,Horrible season 8!,3,"so sad to see such a complex story transform into basic, uninspiring and irrational story full of plot holes with basic, one,dimensional characters. the whole point of the show and everything that we watched prior season 8 goes down the drain now. valar morgulis, and so is got!"
2019-05-20,milannerevar,Think twice before watching all seasons,10,"first 5 seasons are simply masterpieces another 2 are not as good but still better than most other shows. however last season is a disappointment which will make you feel like the whole show was waste of your time.10/10 for season 1,7, 0/10 for season 8. one could argue that season 8 does not deserve 0/10 because it had great actors, cinematography, etc. but you know what? yes, a single thing can ruin everything else. and it did."
2019-06-11,simonfnilsson,Unbelivable,10,"simply the best show ever created, i dont know how i could ever watch another show after this one! only thing negative about it was a pretty dissapointing final season. also i would recommend watching it an episode a day or less to give yourself time to think about all the things that happens in the episode, a misstake i made and i think it took some of the excitement out of it. the show has a tremendous depth to it not found anywhere else and you really need a couple of days to apreciate each episode."
2019-05-20,rahultyagi-17405,Greatest show turned to ASH,8,"i used to love the show until season 7, but d&d you guys ruined the wait of 2 years.. you guys owe the fans a better ending than what you showed.. i liked a stark running the kingdom but not bran and above all bran being a three eye raven why the hell he needs a master of whispers when he can see everything.."
2019-05-13,campsbayrich,Seasons 1 - 5 are incredible and it devolves from there...,10,"the period where the tv show follows the books are really incredible, but beyond that point they've gone ""hollywood"" and used all the old tv tropes, the lack of which made the first five seasons so refreshing."
2019-05-06,archiemalhi,A failure to the characters we love...,10,i was expecting to cry from my favourite characters dying in meaningful ways but instead im crying because of the writers betrayal to one of the best shows ever made.
2018-11-09,leannealawi,Epic,8,i will be very emotional when this series comes to an end it truly is an amazing show
2019-04-09,kalelaz,Clearly the best show in the world !!,9,honestly gonna cry for a long time when it ends ! it's just so fascinating. and amazing how big the fan base has become and how far it's reached

2019-05-30,tommccormak,Don't listen to the haters,10,"game of thrones is one of them tv series, you get it or you don't! the whole seven series were amazing and everything made sense, as you watched the series you had these stupid fan theories and these die hard fans which would come up with the most obscene endings for season 8.then comes season 8 and all these fans begin hating on the show because it didn't pan out how they wanted it to. if you rewatch the series after season 8 it all makes sense and to be honest nothing else could of been done with the show. people keep talking (moaning) about character developments being ruined in the last series but how else can you end their character arc... the last series was finished how it always was meant to. the bitter people can sign petitions and try and remake the story but they can't.to summarise the show is great and just make your own opinion on it without any fans whining about it. people mention breaking bad which is also a great series but that had so many flaws and filler episodes which weren't necessary. you cannot compare this show to anything else.sit back and enjoy!"

2017-02-02,michaelsalvatore-27937,I think Daenarys Targaryen,1,"game of thrones is considered to be the best show ever made to numerous people and critics. one of the most popular characters in the series is daenerys targaryen. the reason so many people love her is that she is a main, female character who shows great strength and intelligence. the battle for westeros is never ending. however, she will eventually rule over westeros because daenerys has a lot of assets, skill, and is very likable. daenerys targaryen is arguably the best character on the show, what with her controlling the last 3 dragons on earth. speaking of her dragons, they are a great asset in a battle and can really help her take over westeros. the reason is the technology of the westeros struggles to hit flying targets with accuracy since all they have are bows, arrows, and mounted crossbows. they also don't have anything to control fires (roberts). another upside to these dragons is that they are all trained and love daenerys and follow her orders. all 3 dragons, drogon named after khal drogo, rhaegal named after rhaegar targaryen, and viserion named after viserys targaryen, breath fire on anything she commands them to when she states the word drakara. so with no defenses to prevent the dragons to just do work it will be easy to take over westeros.just like in any time period or anywhere in the world, having an army to fight a war is probably the most important thing. lucky for daenarys she has a very skilled army. her army consists of around 8,000 unsullied. unsullied are an army who is taken right from birth and taught to fight and the unsullied feels no pain and are very loyal to daenerys. they are very skilled and have a very smart, commanding general below daenarys. the next piece of her army consists of an outstanding 58,000 dothraki. all though not all of them are equipped to fight, only about 8,000,10,000 are children, women or elderly, however the fully grown men are some of the best warriors known to man, because their religion is pretty much being better and bigger than another (roberts). lastly she has 3 dragons which will indeed do work. with the help of jon snow she may have 2 thousand weddings and 1 giant. so she has a massive army consisting of wildlings, unsullied, dothraki, dragons, and one giant. this is one of the weaker arguments, but still has a lot of significance. daenerys targaryen's father was king before he was murdered, making her the rightful queen or ruler of the iron throne. you may wonder why this is important. if people think that you deserve to rule, you will gain allies. with allies, it means more troops, more troops means it is a greater chance to win the battle thus leading to the winning of the war. it's a chain reaction(brady). maybe if she has a claim, it may push her even more to avenge her father. lineage is a way to gain support. having skill is extremely important. you can't play a sport unless you have a skill or you will be laughed at and no one will take you seriously. luckily for daenarys she has the skill so other leaders consider her a threat. everyone knows she has skill because she took over slaver's bay with little to no fight. she took over meereen with relative ease(the telegraph). keep in mind, mereen is a very big city. even in mereen hundreds maybe even thousands of people turn against her and she handles it well. the size of her army plus her strategy and skill will surely destroy kings landing allowing her take over the iron throne. practice with anything will help, it doesn't matter what it is if you practice you will get better and she has practiced conquering and now she is going to king's landing.strategy is huge when it comes to war. having a good strategy is practically the war. you can't send 400 guys with a knife against 1,000 men with guns. so having a strategy is essential. luckily for her, she has a great strategy. the reason we know it's a great strategy is because it has worked before. her ancestors used the same strategy she is using, but with less men. the strategy she is using consists of pure mayhem on the ground as her infantry tries to penetrate the walls of king's landing(brady). while she rains hell from above with her dragons, if it has already worked and she is just upgrading what her ancestors have already done, then she must be victorious.being likable is very important. if you're an an unlikable person and you are trying to lead an army they may not be loyal. if you're mean and don't have respect for your men they won't respect you. if they don't think you will die for them, then why would they die for you. another great thing about being a likable queen/ general in daenerys case is that because she is likable and winning people want to join her and or ally with her(brady). jon snow being her brother may not seem to be of some importance, but it goes a long way. jon snow is a very likable person and has already gotten an abundance of allies. he has winterfell, he has the wildlings, and he has the night's watch. in the alliance of the wildlings they have the last giant, which is a huge asset. now aside from jon snow being good with allies, he is very skilled in combat. there are very few people who had beaten him. (andrea livio). lastly, jon snow has the capability to be a great general since he commanded the night's watch along with the wildlings."
2019-05-31,businesscagdasaydin,Brief review,7,"what made this series great for me was the good performance of the actors, their distinguished and powerful characters along with amazing sceneries and unsuspected plot twist right at the moment when you were certain of something to happen. it is hard to love or hate one specific character throughot all seasons, in other words, to have one favorite character or personal hero as they all evolve and grow both physically and mentally. this series challenges the boundaries what is okay to be shown in serieses both in plots and visually. if you can handle severe explicit scenes with nudity and violence which are essential parts of this then you'll definitely like it, but there is also more to game of thrones than this surface. my personal takeaway is that it clearly shows that human behaviour may strive for goodness or justice, but that human nature itself is flawed because we are human after all. moreover, game of thrones is neither black or white though a dynamic grey area where good may become evil and evil may become good or where you have a state of both existing simultaneously. while many side stories have been building up continously over many episodes, i don't see the point of how some of them were important in the end after all e.g. what happened to bran stark and why it was so important in the end. and, some of the side stories were also too shallow leaving out deeper insights behind them. the last episode, or even the last episodes, felt too rushed and the storyline felt missing some points once in a while at some situations. in general, this series was definitely a unique and thrilling experience."
2019-04-22,anitakadar,Great,1,this is the best tv serie ever known!please don't let it end with season 8.:(

2019-10-17,zeepster_,Worse ending than The Sopranos.,10,"all that building up goes to waste... great show, enjoy watching season 1 , 6. 7 is moving downhill. then season 8 comes by and all the characters that you've come to know are suddenly acting crazy and all logic is out the door. did the sopranos ending strike a negative chord with you? here's got season 8 finale one upping that ending."
2019-05-21,ginakyr,I loved the show!,10,"the best show ever made! in season 8 there are some ""mistakes"" that cannot be unseen.. despite all, the show was a masterpiece. i loved every minute!"

2021-04-27,abomed-05434,Respect the show please,10,"game of thrones is a masterpiece end off. yes the ending wasn't what we expected but as they say ""its about the journey"" and trust me there is no better journey than game of thrones it had all the elements of a great show and people should start acknowledging that instead of hating on it."
2019-04-30,anas_f-87810,The best show ever,10,everything is incredible the corrector the story the cities the shooting the editing all of them is perfect.
2019-01-01,lukasmalmstrom,Epic,1,best series ever! watched it serveral times and it is the greatest creation to been made
2017-03-10,vanijuneja,Watch Breaking Bad instead of this sh*t,10,in my opinion season 6 of got is the worst season ever made in the history of tv series. this season started good but lost its pace in the middle episodes. the only episode that i've enjoyed in this season is 'the door'. if you're thinking of start watching got leave it instead watch breaking bad. that show is a masterpiece.
2019-05-13,hayne-24830,Shame on you writers,10,"first thank you jj martin! and. trash season 8 ,
shame on you"
2019-04-12,anaidaclahim,Speechless,10,"watch it and convince yourself! you can find in it everything, all genres, all kinds of scenes, characters, just everything."
2020-10-19,krellepeter,Unable to rewatch it,10,i started watching this series by the end of the 6 th season and rewatched it 4 times prior to the last season. what dumb and dummer did to this dedicated masterpiece of television is horrible. everytime i see an episode of the earlier seasons i think about a rewatch but when i remember the wasted potential of the ending... i quit.very sorry about this
2017-03-18,aceventura-91774,"Bloody, violent and nude with great actors with bipolar disorders",1,"1. if you like blood coming out of sliced throats. you got it enough to fill lake michigan. thrilled for a while then irritating in the end.2. if you are into nude. you got plenty (if not too many) of tits, cocks and all other private parts in almost all episodes (yes, sex and gay sex are plenty too) 3. if you like violence such as beheading and chopping meat, you will be satisfied. in addition, you will also find all violence known to men everywhere in the series. 4. almost all main actors/actresses have bipolar disorders(maybe except the starks family, the most tragic and ""honorable"" house.) you will find betrayals everywhere: father and son, man and wife, brother and sister, etc. ""everybody"" is betrayed by someone close to stimulate suspense and surprise. the main actors/actresses are murdered in a rate faster than the writers create them. 5. in the end, they almost ran out of kings, queens and lords so the story has to change to the undead (so you can bring back the dead actor) and magic (people and soldiers are running out too)6. if this whole series is a fantasy story to tell, you will find all others are too real to be in the same category."
2019-07-03,lavamina,Was the best until the end,10,"was the best till the end
the last season was failure"
2019-05-16,elpabloperth,Game of Thrones,10,"i've given 4 stars as that's how many seasons were good before they started to get away from the books. the rest of the seasons aren't great. you'd imagine they would lead all the seasons to an ultimate epic final season to explain all the mysteries. nope, very very poor writing. but it's typical greed, get the seasons out so we can capatilise on how much money can be made."
2017-10-04,nirjhorahmed,GOT is a love,10,"one of the best things that happened to my life was game of thrones. truly never before i watched any tv series. and when i started watching it in june,2017, i couldn't just stop watching this. finished 6 seasons just in 5 days. that explains the quality of this series. got is the only thing which made me interested in tv series. i wish i had seen this show earlier."
2017-03-28,duongvannhan,movie the best,10,game of throne is the best movie i watch. i look forward to every day the film out its sequel the movie must say is too great. i usually watch on hbo and watch it on high quality movies like the site. freeseries..net. while here i can watch many other good movies but my first priority is always the game of throne

2019-05-23,tremerkan,Didn't clear up anything,2,"so many unanswered questions. waste of seasons in the past going into depth and many things that have nothing to do with the storyline what so ever. the ending seems like it was literally thrown together overnight and highly disappointing. i feel like i've wasted so much of my life on this show, for this last season to be so terrible. disappointed."
2020-01-02,jenalynnweaver,GOT,9,show is amazing! i love the character development and fantasy aspect to the show. best thing since lord of the rings. just be wary of the nudity. it can be a bit much.

2017-06-05,gheo-76755,"Cheap, weird, bad soap opera",10,"there is nothing about value, art, good acting, good screen play, good actors in this movie. it is enough to watch (maxim.) 30 minutes to understand that, if you are an average person, some intelligent human being with some education and a little good sense. they put together everything is bad in cinema/tv and everything is destroying the cinema in this so,called great movie: endless talking about nothing, bad story, violence and sex without sense/goal , the fantasy is not fantasy, the romance is not romance. just a room from hell, that room where someone would be tortured with nothing. it makes the people stupid. some terrible mix between a south-american soap opera (telenovela) and a bad, old video game. but this is not enough! they just don't want to stop this error of nature - it makes money, people! lots of money! it is very hard to find words for this ... thing. if you want to torture an intelligent person, well, you got a perfect tool: the games of thrones! this ""movie"" is a lesson about ""how to spend many millions and make the most false thing in the world"". yes, because over all this and beyond ...thrones an absolute falsity, hollowness. a very bad movie is sometimes funny, relaxing etc. this one is not. this is just one of the most terrible things the cinema has produced in its all history."

2019-05-06,maherjaloudi,And let cook over low heat !!,10,"the only reason i'm giving this show 10/10 is because of the effort of george r. r. martin and the cast on this story. it was amazing, spectacular, complicated in a way you can understand it and love it.
i'm writing this because i'm disappointed as much as anyone else, the first five season was 100/10 no way to describe it just it was perfect, since then the directors made a choice to continue without george r. r. martin and they cook it over high heat, they destroyed everything they built i'm not even sorry for my self as much as for them, literally every character has been collapsed after jon get back to life, got made us to believe that there are no hero's why do we have one now."

2019-05-20,michaelhulls,Disappointing,6,yep disappointing... and no my review isn't too shortttttr!!
2017-06-02,desmonddane,"Like a lot, but not love...",5,"i'm not trying to be a hater here and slam this show just for slamming's sake. and to that end, i'm not even slamming this show. it is very, very well done. the set design and production value is stunning. one episode i'm sure costs the same amount as a low budget film to be sure. but while i really like this show, i don't love it. and the reason is because it is just so goddamn depressing. call me an eternal optimist, but i have to deal with reality on a regular basis and there's already so much depressing, disgusting crap going on all over the real world, so i like my escape from reality to have a little, just a little, bit of hope. once in a while i need a victory. and you'll be very hard pressed to find a victory during any storyline in the game of thrones. it's just always so much hate and hell and death and malice. ugh. it gets to be so heavy and drawn out. yes, it's written well, the casting is superb, but come on already. give me someone to cheer for once in a while. i've never read the books but friends of mine who have did not enjoy them stating that everyone you love or grow attached to dies; that the author just wants to kill everyone off. i get it. from a writer's perspective, i'm sure he wants to keep everyone on their toes, sitting on the edge of their seats, but in order to keep your audience, you gotta give them a little love too.it also says a lot about the world today in which this show is loved by everyone. ask anyone and they'll tell you it's their favorite show. i think that says a lot about society. everyone hates everybody and wants everyone dead and gets lots of enjoyment from all the horrible things that happen to everyone. nice. look at cersei for example. why is she so hateful? i mean, i can understand why she is now, but at the start....she had a brother whom she could hump any time she wanted, children she loved, a brother who wanted very much to be loved by her (and yet she hated for no good reason) and a father who adored her. even as a child in flashback, she was an evil little bitch. why? is there an inciting incident that i missed in her life? she really is just hell,bent on killing anyone to sit in the world's most uncomfortable chair? i could see if she had been abused as a child, her family killed, loss of her wealth and driven into poverty by oppressive powers, etc. but last time i checked, her family did all that cold business to everyone else. anyway, her motivation seems a little reaching. but of course now she has motivation with all her kids dead.the other thing that i don't find works is that there are way too many story lines and characters and none of them really cross over or come together. i feel like we've been waiting forever to see sansa and her sister cross paths. finally jon and sansa are together but man it took forever. and finally when riccan is brought together with his family it's only for a very short-lived time. i wish more of the story lines intersected. i guess it's coming because now we have daenarys and tyrion together which is cool so i hope they continue. but do we really need a bunch of snow zombies??? this storyline seems so lame. we've got enough characters to keep things interesting, just sayin'.anyway, i absolutely love dragons so that's what keeps me watching. i hope there are more dragons in this season."

2020-10-17,jamal_lutfi,Best serious worst ending,10,"worst ending i could ever expect, thanks george r r martin for ruining the great epic masterpiece we all love, your marvelous story was ended with a terrible way that we just couldn't process..thanks d&d for "" the most disappointing ending in the history of tv series ""i think you ( grrm , d&d ) had an option between making one more season to make sense to your current main characters ending or simply choose an alternative ending which would've made much more sense to all the motives, goals and emotions that you built up in your characters through the previous episodes .. in all of the episodes of got we were amazed by the art direction , cinemagraphy , sfx , vfx , scorings, actors performance , costumes , lighting, post,production in general ... etc , sadly all of this was ruined by e6 narrative, from my perspective what's really considered a good ending is not just the unexpected!! it has to be realistic & credible unexpected which would've been great & awesome ..thanks hbo for a great 71 episode ( the finale doesn't count 🙃 ).. i really believed that you might have some genius twist in the last episode but it turned out to be a classic ending that was expected after episode 5 , the finale was filled with cold emotions and weak dramatic processing ( except for the dragon burning the throne shot ) , i actually stopped caring about what happens next in the finale after 37:00 ..a "" real thanks "" for all of the amazing stars starting with emilia clarke, kit harington , sophie turner, maisie williams... and all other amazing actors.. & the creative production & post-production team..at last if the purpose of this ending was to create controversy and high exposure then congratulations you have succeeded with your goal,but if you look at the finale ratings ( what really matters) you will know what i mean .."
2020-03-18,lagoop,Well it had potential,10,"started off really strong. even as the show strayed from the books, though i felt it slipped a tiny bit quality, but not much. then the final season happened. what a disappointing finish to what might just be the last appointment viewing show there is."

2017-07-31,faulknerf,"Great show and cast, but....",10,"i love game of thrones. took me many years to finally give it a try, and i'm glad i did. i was hesitant at first hearing about the rape scenes. that's honestly the only reason i am giving the show a 9 and not a 10. it's as if the women can't be strong and overcome life's hardships until they have been raped in the show. that part is a bit strange and unnecessary. it's also completely my own opinion, i'm aware not everyone sees it that way. it's easy to reward the cast, writer, and graphic designers when applauding the show, but when you start watching the episodes over a couple times, the unsung heroes are the film crew. it's pure artistry."

2019-03-08,ariellee-60380,Best TV show ever,7,love the dynamic of the show and the dramatic twists getting so intense from season 6
2018-12-22,sjurkiw,So excited but so sad at the same time....,7,i'm sad that game of thrones is ending and excited and can't wait to see season 8 and how it will begin and end the suspense has been killing me so starting today 12/22/2018 i will watch every episode til season 8 begins. i also can't wait to see the prequel also. live the game & love the throne!
2019-04-23,mandeep-02861,The best tv series ever,10,"set on the fictional continents of westeros and essos, game of thrones has several plots and a large ensemble cast, but follows three story arcs. the first arc is about the iron throne of the seven kingdoms, and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. the second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled and is plotting a return to the throne. the third story arc follows the night's watch, a brotherhood defending the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the north."
2020-07-13,arunjb,Dumb writers,8,two idiot's ruined the entire show. so rushed so pathetic ending ever made in history. i am watching this show since i was 16 years old now i am 24 never missed a single episode everything is just a joke at the end i can still get over it
2017-06-28,janaragab,i like it,9,"i watched this wonderful series and enjoyed it a lot but it has many scenes that are not suitable for family viewing. summers span decades. winters can last a lifetime. and the struggle for the iron throne continues.it stretches from the south, where heat breeds plots, lusts and intrigues, to the vast and savage eastern lands, where a young queen raises an army. all the while, in the frozen north, an 800,foot wall of ice precariously protects the war-ravaged kingdom from the dark forces that lie beyond. kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars, lords and honest men...all play the 'game of thrones.'"
2019-05-22,daud_mk,Last Season,10,seriously last season is just waste of time and really pathetic 😡
2018-09-20,nicktse,One of the few TV series I'm hooked on,9,"there haven't been many tv series that had me hooked, but got is definitely one of them. high production values, great cast and acting, and an enticing story. i haven't read the books, so this point of view is coming from someone without a grudge on book to movie differences :)"
2019-06-05,mrmoh-72878,Best series ever!!,9,"best story, although at the end it was a bit not that good, best acting music, fighting scenes"
2020-07-19,isidorarakic,Not perfect - but still better than others,10,"as title of my review says, it's almost perfect. first 6 seasons are amazing. they are truly best of any series ever. the last two seasons are, well, disappointing. season 7 has really awful storyline, season 8 is equally bad, but also super fast, which makes it even worse. after everything, the show still deserves 10 because it set the bar way too high for other tv series."
2019-04-25,lion-07728,What do I write!!,10,"it's the best to show ever , i never watched something like this .. great dialogues, a great dramatic plot, the evolution of characters in the series, something you do not see every hundred years"
2019-09-30,chelleybeeuk,Simply the Best Ever TV Series,4,"cannot fault this series from beginning to end. simply stunning and deserves all of the awards it's received. amazing acting, fantastic costumes and locations. the storyline keeps you enthralled until the last second. i don't know of anything that can ever come close to game of thrones. i actually cried when it finished. best thing i have ever watched 10/10"

same thing happened with lord of the rings.
but i found world of warcraft great.
so this is bad heroic fantasy."

2019-06-15,goshi-40307,Sad,8,"i knew that the end of got was going to be bittersweet, because it meant that my favorite tv series was coming to an end, after 9 years invested in it. at the same time, i was consoled by the idea that i would always have the opportunity of seeing and enjoying it again whenever i wanted. the end of the show ruined that. i can't see anything related to got without feeling bad and disappointed. it is unlikely that i will ever watch it again. it is really sad for all the fans that are feeling cheated like me and the cast and crew that worked so hard on exceeding our expectations."
2019-05-20,xflipaex,Great show. Till the end.,10,remove season 8. will rate accordingly. useless plots and bland story telling. i understand there is no source material. please do not write star wars the same.
2019-05-02,shashanksahu-66969,Don't care who will sit,10,s8e3 was a disaster for this show like from the 1st episode they were talking about long night and it ended in a sec without even a fight
2019-05-26,gutierrezmathew,Not worth it,10,save your time and energy. this show is emotionally exhausting and at times it leaves you dumbfounded but the ending is so poorly constructed that you can tell they were just trying to save money while promoting sequels that they knew were never a possibility anyway. basically they ended the show on a budget and it shows. so if you're all about the journey and not the conclusion then this is the show for you.
2017-08-13,sahilgulati-20812,Number 1 TV series of this century 😍,10,"simply amazing. no other tv series can ever compete game of thrones when it comes to story line, surprises and battles. the scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting. game of thrones on hbo is a tv adaption of george r.r. martin's books, a song of ice and fire.it is difficult to translate books into movies or tv series, but hbo's got made it look easy.i don't believe there has ever been anything like 'game of thrones' on tv. the sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering."
2021-05-08,abrahamogide,Incomplete story,4,i gave it a 10 three years ago but i had to change it to a 9 because of the lack of proper explanation of the white walkers storyline. i don't mind the final season. the final season is not great but it's not too bad.
2019-04-15,raybkam,Disappointed,10,"after two years of waiting, got came with a mediocre opening to continue the disaster they made in season seven. the script and conversations between the characters was bad comparing to previous seasons, the green screen and visual effects specially when they ride the dragons was poor. moreover, the soundtrack wasn't as good as it used to be."
2019-02-10,wizzardkiriq,TBIES,10,"the best tv show i ever had a chance to wach... took me 3 days to finish all 7 season, best time spent in my life"

2019-05-27,ramankaur-61140,An Ultimate and Mind blowing Series of all time,10,"although the finale season was not as much good as expected, the overall series is just mind blowing. you can never get bored of this series no matter how many times you watch it. the acting is so good, the plots and twists.. oh my god. one can never imagine what would happen next. until season 7, the series was ultimate and people all over the world were waiting for the final season with great enthusiasm and expectations. although i liked the finals, it could have been more good. i think the writers did a bad job. so many character developments such as dany, jamie and more, but in the last they did what people are not expecting them to do... but flaws apart, i think no other series could surpass the love and affection which got received from its fan.. i was, i am and i will always be a crazy fan of this show and i highly recommend this to everyone."
2019-05-08,ragulramamurthy,So good until something rusted it..,10,"this show made me addicted to it. i saw the whole 6 seasons 6 times and i remember almost all dialogues. excellent story platform, brilliant actors and a ton load of money made this show the greatest show on earth. but time is the enemy that rust humans. i could see something was missing in the season 7. but in season 8, the show is completely derailed from its course.."
2019-05-10,aymericdakin,Amazing show until season 4. Ok for 5 and 6. Hard to watch for 7 and 8...,10,"this show started with a bang and kept all its promises for 4 seasons. complex plot with amazing characters, dialogs with deep meaning and consequences, good cinematography and great writing.
season 5 and 6 were made after they ran out of source material and it shows a bit. some episodes are outstanding however, and it makes out for some weaker plot lines.
season 7 and 8 are harder to watch as characters start to betray their own arcs. dialogs are weak and the main plots don't make sense anymore. the cinematography is still great but the writing is getting worse and worse and the story feels rushed. the plot armor that was almost non existent in the beginning gets thicker and thicker.
it's hard to watch such a great show end like this.in short, it is a great ride, but the landing is hard and messy."
2019-05-04,nealdee,"Great start, not so great ending",10,"the last four seasons were a great downgrade to what otherwise might have become the greatest show of all time. coincidentally, it's all around the same they ran out of book material haha"
2017-08-22,cronnok,Horrible development of almost everything.,10,"for me this series developed in a strange way. the start up was quite interesting. many characters and relationships to think about. then some of my most loved characters died but i could deal with it. the story was a good one even so it was not that accurate based on what the books told us. now something changed when there were no books for the contents base anymore. from that point characters teleported around the world and the timeline fell apart as well as the world. to shrink and enlarge the world and the distances whenever the director likes it is the best way to destroy the experience of the spectators who have a little sense of intelligence. the dialogues went shorter with every episode and the plot line had nothing interesting anymore. it became a bad story with everything shorten or cut out to get it to the end as fast as they can. at the same pace the action increases and the fighting scenes took over everything. nothing else is interesting anymore. sorry but game of thrones is a bunch of nonsense fighting scenes right now, nothing more. deal with it."
2017-08-24,alveslucianoinfo,Fantastisc Series,10,"readers who come to this review later in the series must note that, at the time of this writing, i have only seen the inaugural episode. it's probably safe to say, when dealing with a series of novels as beloved as the song of ice and fire, the most scrutinized aspect of the t.v. adaptation will be how well it holds to the source material. i am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.while certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). the characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably peter dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. however; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.special effects were well done, though nothing mind,blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). it also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.all and all, i am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and i went into it expecting to be disappointed. if i were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children"
2019-06-01,aledances-11856,Best. Show. Ever.,10,"the title says it all. game of thrones is a fantastically written show filled with amazingly developed character arcs and storylines. each character is so diverse and well thought out. their stories make the audience feel for each and every character, good or evil. along with the great writing, there is also beautiful cinematography. the shots are breathtaking and the cgi work is impeccable. in each episode, you can see the hard work and talent it took to create the wonderful show of game of thrones. each actor, writer, producer, director, and beyond deserves every credit and more. game of thrones will take you on an emotional rollercoaster, but every minute of it is worth it. grab your tisses and hit play. you'll love it."
2017-08-28,srdjanerkic,Godly,10,"godly, it gets better and better each season . season 7 finale got me in awe . i can't wait for the last season in the late 2018. everything from plot , cast , effects and music is astounding . i hope the last 6 episodes of the show will be long enough like mini,movies or something like that . i expect nothing less of a masterpiece we saw in the earlier seasons."
2017-08-28,saimfedy,One of my favorite series.,10,"i have been hearing about it several years but last year i decided to watch since i have already missed all the season of franchise. i had to watch the whole 5 season consecutively in a month in order to comprehend the series.i would say it was spectacular in term of story line,effect, acting and more politics. the only thing that disappoints me is vulgarity and nakedness.overall,when one watch it you feel that somehow you are part of it.those who are looking for some grat effect and fantasies this could be better choice."
2017-09-02,syazsrn,The most glorious TV series ever,10,"if you have 1month left of your life, stay home and watch game of thrones. totally worth it.nothing in the world of tv series can compare to got. it was brilliant work piece ever. 10/10.my life is complete."
2017-09-02,abhibhangu,Best Show I've Ever Seen on Television,10,"no tv series or movies can be compared to got. the story in got is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events.acting is great, costumes and scenery as well. every character is unique and interesting, and its great watching them develop. everything is top quality. if you start watching this, be prepared to get addicted quickly , you'll just feel a strong urge to watch the next episode, and another, and another until no more episodes are left. there is a downside to got however that needs to be mentioned: as many have stated, after watching it, you will realize that 99% shows/movies out there are not up to its standards. a show of this quality is rare indeed."
2021-09-28,jillianchoo,Season 8 ruined the best TV show ever..,10,"i was told season 7 & 8 are disappointment but still had to watch since i loved the previous seasons. whoever made season 8 completely ruined the best tv show ever.. 😑 the storyline is so predictable downright boring. even musics are low quality. it follows well,used typical hollywood fantasy movie plots.. not to mention the frequent jokes the characyers make."
2019-05-21,bhattburhan,Last Season was disappointing...,10,"last season was disappointing, it shouldn't be top rated series that would be injustice to breaking bad, the writers should learn from the writers of bb not a dull moment from beginning to end(especially the ending), seems like i wasted my time these 9 years during watching the show( especially waiting 2 years for last and the least season)..."

2017-09-13,ajbasa,"Great action, suspense, plot and character development!",10,"i highly recommend this show as it contains lots of action, drama, suspense, and a lot of character development! you can't deny that the most exciting aspects of this show include sex and fighting but most importantly it contains dragons! the first few seasons are a bit slow but then the show starts to pick up by seasons 4 and 5. i also recommend trying to watch the show with your undivided attention as there are lots of pertinent information presented via body language and dialogue besides all the action sequences! one of the best shows that i have seen so far!"
2020-02-15,deanfsimon,Game of Thrones,1,"one of the best shows ive ever watched . season 1,6 was jaw dropping and addicting. season 1 and and season 4 were my favorites of the series, season 7 has some amazing visuals and set up what i hoping was gonna be an amazing last season but season 8 wasn't what i expected and was disappointed with the last few episodes. but still definitely will tell everyone to watch this and will always be one of my favorite shows!"
2017-12-28,jsenkis,A fantasy for fantasy sceptics,9,"a gripping tale of human relations set in a fictional medieval world, it might seem off,putting at first to commit yourself to what would seem like a typical tale of knights and evil kings, but it is the exact opposite of that. ""game of thrones"", adapted to the screen from george r.r. martin's ""a song of ice and fire"" book series, is a masterful television production, which utilizes the complex plot and characters to their fullest potential.  you never really know who's gonna make it after you settle in during the first few episodes and understand what's even happening. once you have an idea what the plot is about, you can't really stop thinking about it. so many characters, each with their own motivations and mysterious plots- you just can't help but be pulled into it all, not fully knowing who you like most and who you can't stand. the characters are among the best in the history of literature, and are all dynamic and come alive on the screen.
 the conventional filmmaking is also top quality, as is expected from a top tier production. there are no foul editing mistakes, bad acting sequences or truly questionable motivations- it is all quite perfectly done.
 the main point that this show proves (not concerning the plot), is that the setting, in this case a medieval fantasy world, should not determine what the viewer should expect from it. as much as i would personally enjoy a well done, typical fantasy show with fantasy tropes, this is not it. no such tropes are used and the world is a dirty, realistic look at the nature of human relations, entwined with the supernatural."

the great performance by the actors and all the people behind this incredible work.
the final season was absolutely great and the end of this show reminded us that this is the game of thrones.... . as tyrion lannister once said: ""there's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. nothing can stop it. no enemy can defeat it"" and so he reminded us that nither a tv series or a movie could ever beat the game of thrones."

2019-05-20,manavmittal-55841,THIS IS ONLY FOR LAST EPISODE OF S8,10,s8 e6 was a big disappointment... show that has 9.5 rating ends in such a manner... still can't believe it... all thousands n thousands of fan who all supported this show should get justice. last episode murdered the taste of the show. game of thrones was best known for it's surprises and it's unpredictable things. but s8 e6... was totally a disappointment. now what has happened cannot be corrected but yes got shouldn't have been rushed. when one show is admired so much by the audience it's becomes one kind of responsibility for all the director and the actors to give them the farewell that they deserve. i am really sorry for my words. but got i know it is hard to accept for you but this time you have failed. your very last episode.
2011-07-26,starkfaun,Soapopera in the middle ages,10,"no spoilers i find this show entertaining enough to watch, but i don't understand the hype. probably because a lot of fans of the books like it and think it's true to the authors words. but, i never heard about it, so i started watching fresh and to be honest, it took me about 3 episodes to get into it. i had the feeling i was watching a mediocre acting crew of a mediocre story from a soap opera in the middle ages. i think it's fairly well made, the settings are nice a lot of the times, but that doesn't make it an outstanding series. sean bean is good in his role, but he's born for these kind of parts. but the rest, well, sorry to say, it's just mediocre acting and a very thin storyline, even not always edited very well. a 7 for the way it is visually brought and the fact that it did entertain me enough to sit the 10 episodes trough, but for the rest i think it's overrated."
2018-02-13,chaosdarling,A Little Game,10,"when i try to predict where this show is heading, i play a little game. i assume the worst. what's the stupidest reason for someone's actions? what's the stupidest direction they might be heading? picture every stupid scenario and every crappy line of dialogue all at once, in your mind and you'll never be disappointed."
2017-10-26,bmburakkara,Fantasy world unlike any world setting,10,"george r. r. martins fantasy world is unlike any world setting you have ever seen. this fantasy series will not have your typical hero which will defeat the evil of this world. in fact you could argue that everyone in this world setting is egoistic and a bit evil. unlike in lord of the rings you can not be sure what will happen and who will survive. this is what george achieved. you are always anxious about whether or not your favorite character will die. the series portrays the harshness of war in the real world. heroes and innocent people die. there are lies, greed and jealousy all over westeros. the producers of got achieved the immersion of this fantasy world. as soon as the epic intro begins you are in westeros, you feel for your favorite characters and of course you are afraid that they may die because of this is war. the series follows the book closely but in the end the producers had to create their own path. i disliked some of the choices in the last season but what could you expect from the producers. the author couldn't finish it in time and now we expect them to finish such a vast and complicated story in a much shorter time.if you want to see a lord of the rings series with more aggression, blood and most importantly political games, then game of thrones is certainly something for you."
2020-03-23,arjunkdps,Best series I've ever watched.,10,"i started watching got after my friends suggestions , the later on it became an addiction. each time daenerys yell "" dracaris "" i had goosebumps. mind,blowing this one"
2018-08-29,elfilaliamin1,The best TV series that you can watch ever,2,"no tv series or movies can be compared to got. in many bs movies/shows you can predict the ending after watching it for a few minutes (good ones always win and the bad ones seem to be completely retarded, blind, and incompetent. well, not anymore!!!the story in got is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events."

2019-05-22,sack_1980,What An Amazing Ride!,10,"i have always had a hard time with shows i love ending. it is hard to say goodbye to a family of actors that allowed you to watch them grow as actors and, well, just grow up. i wonder if that is why so many people are upset but how it ended. because it ended.like most shows, sometimes things went a little slow, sometimes they went at a perfect speed and other times it feels too fast. though for myself, with the last season, it was fast, but it was because i knew the end was coming and i wanted more.if you are up for an amazing ride, a roller coaster and willing to lose some (a lot) of characters you love and keep some you despise, you will enjoy amazing acting, writing, the unexpected, and all the rest that comes with a masterpiece like game of thrones."
2019-05-20,seyediehsan,Best series of all time? Naaa I dont think so.,10,"the series was great almost all previous 7 seasons. i was crying in the scene of podrick singing, all characters waiting for the night king. it was awesome at that point. all i could think about for 2 years was whats gonna happen on s08e03, and what happened wasnt good. and the rest of the show was like 6/10 good. the scene with tyrion and jaime was heartbreaking and great though. i stopped enjoying the show after the death of baelish!. and then died varys (who was right about daenerys). the ending wasnt bad, not like dexter or lost. but it wasnt great like breaking bad. it was ok."

2018-11-29,aliholly-18083,If this is considered entertainment the world is doomed,1,"incest, rape and gore does not equal entertainment. there is nothing redeeming about this show except for the sets, and non violent special effects, which are beautiful, but not worth sitting through the show for."
2019-05-14,ourgour,Final Season is a huge disaster,10,"final season would look like it was rushed, character development goes down the drain of few main characters. somehow they stop following their own traits, for e.g varys does everything in his hand to preserve the realm, seeing his character from past 7 season one can never think he just dies by giving hisaelf up like that. same goes for jaime lannister, he was redeeming himself over the seasons and now he won't get his page in book of brothers filled with good stuff about him. biggest disappointment was there was no background of night king even in season 8."
2019-05-21,evanxwhite,First 7 seasons were amazing,10,"a good show up until the final season. wasn't as bad as other series' finales but very disappointing. only watch if you're interested in being let down as the last season was rushed and was written poorly , characters not staying true and consistent to themselves compared to previous seasons. was one of my favorite shows - will always be in my heart - but the last season ruined numerous things for me. dany deserved better."

2019-05-20,marouanlk,Detective Grey Worm,10,"i don't understand how they found out jon killed dany. drogon flew off with her body with the dagger still in her heart. nobody saw jon going to talk to dany, unless i missed something.and like you said, what happened to varys' notes claiming jon is the rightful heir to the throne. did he not actually send any out? did dany stop them from being delivered? or did nobody care?how the hell can sansa declare the north's independence (especially since the north was wrecked by the army of the dead and is really weak), but no other lords/ladies try to declare their independence then??? what sansa did should have blown up those talks to have bran be king but instead no one said anything! this season should have been broken into at least two seasons, preferably three. one for the night king, one for the battle for the throne, and one for the aftermath and the overthrow of dany. that would have given plenty of time to show jon and dany's love, dany's decent into madness, and it would have given more impact behind jon's decision to kill dany, but instead it was all rushed into a few episodes."

but i would have been more than happy to own the entire set of got because it was just *that* good.and then season 8 came out... and all desire to watch the show ever again vanished. i'm just glad that i waited and didn't waste my money on what would have become an incomplete collection, because there is no way i would have spent money to buy the disappointment of the last season.
anyone who wants to watch - i recommend that you quit after season seven and just read spoilers for season 8."

2019-05-14,caneshia_v,Season 8 episode 5,6,"not sure if anyone agrees with me on this but i am not happy about the latest episode of got because daenerys killed alot of innocent people and destroyed the city (which probably destroyed the iron throne that she's so wanted and the city she was meant to rule even though for the last how many seasons she has been trying to protect innocence not kill them)..and last week's episode seemed very rushed to me, for something that has been building us up for months and months for it to end so quickly instead of being put into two episodes.. also the night king was very easy to kill as would of thought it would of taken a little more effort and time to kill him"

2019-06-02,wizardxthree,Wish I could only review seasons 1-6....,10,"let me just start off by saying that game of thrones is by far the best show i have ever seen. in seasons 1,6 the dialogue and writing was exquisite. then in seasons 7 and 8 the writers decided to add more battle scenes and gigantic props because of the shows popularity and lost sight of what really made the show good...the stories.....the character arcs.....the writing! game of thrones has really good acting, really good cinematography, and spot on editing but a show needs good writing in order to be successful. seasons 1-6 were a masterpiece. with shows like ""the red wedding"" ""the purple wedding"" and ""the battle of the bast"". but it's the ending that people will remember. in a way the writers were their own worst enemy in seasons 7 and 8. for the sake of the rest of my review let's pretend that game of thrones ended on the finale of season 6 where (let's face it) we all wanted it to end. game of thrones has: great storiesa vast series of complex charactersemotion (when your favorite characters die)satisfaction (when your most hated characters die)lots and lots of bloodsheddragonzromancethe second highest rating on imdb!so please! if you have never seen it....please watch it. for it is a fantastical show."
2012-04-09,sdown,Not as I expected,10,"sadly, i already finished the books, so my expectations were bigger. the books are great and anyone who wants to feel the real thrill of the series should read those. overall the series are ok, but ""haste"" is the overwhelming feeling, like everything was done in a hurry, some of the actors seem to be paid for words per minute, rather than performance.the plots, intrigues, betrayals are described in an excellent manner in the books, but the series keep a rather thin line of those, concentrating more on sex, violence and non,important eye-catching aspects. they missed many important things from books in my opinion, things that would have lead to a better understanding of main plot and of some characters. on top of these, hbo romania managed to make 31 translation errors in 2 episodes, 10 of them being severe. ""calapono"" instead of ""khal pono"" for example. too many for any television that has any respect for it's viewers. the one that translated never touched the books.10 episodes per book are too few to capture the magic described by martin. i strongly recommend the books."

2020-06-02,anilvivekananda,18+ most wonderful series ever I seen,8,i love this series i'm addicted more than pubg i'm deadly fan of pubg but when i started watching this series i'm going to love this series
2020-01-17,snryear,Greatnees,8,"greatneesssssssss its amizing series
i hope forgot my memory to witch it agene"
2019-05-10,debanjanpaul-83967,Best show turned disaster.,8,"as got started, the first four seasons were insanely great. the story, the characters, the mature plot points. everything was just perfect. it was 11/10 for me then. but as the seasons passed and episodes increased, the show became dumber and dumber and dumber. the story became childish, and the premise deteriorated. and now in season 8, it feels like a bunch of kindergarten kids are given the task of writing the plot for this show."
2018-10-01,charuln,Best series of all time,8,"all time favorite.the best yet.the directing,acting,story,visual effects. everything is perfect."
2019-05-06,johnsaiyan,Outstanding TV Series... was/could be the BEST TV Series ever!,8,"i could write this in a couple weeks when ""game of thrones"" season 8/series finale comes to a close... but, after viewing the first 4 episodes of season 8's total of 6 episodes... you notice how much has changed so incredibly fast, since the end of season 7. this season is being rushed, it somehow feels cheap and saddening. this show has become the best tv series i've ever watched. now, they're doing a wonderful job of destroying everything that was great about the show... in record timing. cheap... the night king not being the ""series primary threat"" as he has been the whole time. even before the tv series started, it was obvious from the books who the main antagonist was. the azor ahai/prince that was promised//son of fire/lightbringer prophecies seem meaningless now that those prophecies don't mean anything, since the night king/white walker threat was ended. the lightbringer prophecies was perhaps my favorite one. i just wished they didn't tease us by putting stock into them throughout the whole series. for a series as beloved as this one, they should've ended the final season properly, not a rushed and unfulfilling 6 episodes... i wouldn't have minded if they decided to take another 6,months or even a year to make this ending feel as it should... at least on par with the other seasons. season 8 just really ""feels"" like hectic mediocrity. falling completely short of it's incredible potential. if the remaining 2 episodes in some way change my stance (the show ends with my personal ranking of got changing in any way), then i'll update my review. i truly hope that it's possible, but, i'm not getting my hopes up.m. johnson"
2020-03-15,azharkamarudheen,The Greatest Show Ever (Until S08)!,8,"game of thrones is the best ever happened to me. but you might think why i didn't given 10/10. well that's heart breaking. g.o.t has the best story line , character development, twists, plotting, visuals, everything was godly. what a thrilling show it was. i used to watch this show like one season per day. and rewatched the whole show about 5,6 times. i still can't believe why they fkn destroyed the show like this. i was addicted to the show. i even rewatched the show about 5-6 times before season 8 aired. and when i was watching s08 i was fkn shocked! i was like wtf happened?! my heart broken and deleted the whole show. i won't forgive d&d for ruining this greatest show. they ditched g.o.t for star wars trilogy. if i am to recommend anyone this show i would tell them to watch only the first 7 seasons and stop. so that's why 8/10"
2019-04-30,tarunagr,Didn't live up to the expectations,8,the long lasting war between the living and the dead defied logic and didn't involved one to one battle between jon and the night king which disappointed me the most. also the knight king died without action.in over all the battle didn't live up to the expectations of mine !!!!
2019-04-11,msankalp,Amazing AF !,8,this is going to be the best show you'll ever watch. it contains all that you need.
2018-11-01,grdnpresto,Better than the source material,8,"i used to prefer the books, but i've since become enamored of the tv show and hold it to be superior. i prefer the show because tyrion isn't a noseless monster like he is in the books, i was really dismayed by what happened to him. tyrion was always my favorite character, and seeing him with his due dignity in the show makes it surpass the book in my eyes. it is said that grrm is a discovery writer, or gardener as he puts it, but i feel the books took too many wrong turns, especially becoming too enmeshed in events across the sea. i'll read the books when they come out out of curiosity, but i no longer revere them as i once did.the show does a brilliant job of orchestrating drama with high stakes or a ticking clock, there's always great tension and suspense to the scenes. knowing where the books were going gave them the opportunity to plan out the characters arcs in great detail and with greater contrast between their beginnings and endings, diverging from the books. the story juggles so many plot threads that the story doesn't spin its wheels much, there's always a subplot that is reaching a crisis point. you occasionally have buildup scenes, but there's many more payoff scenes, and boy do they pay off dramatically rich dividends.there is great conflict between the rival families, but the lines between good an evil are blurred so that they are morally grey instead of black and white. often times you follow the story from the perspective of villains, creating sympathy for the devil, so to speak. the world of westerose is often cruel and unforgiving, as heroes lose what they hold dear due to betrayal or ambush. tyrion becomes the victim of a misunderstanding when he is framed for murder, and ned and jamie battle over the well being of tyrion. ned eventually discovers that cerseis children are born of incest and are illegitimate, but before he can reveal the truth king robert is killed while hunting boar. prince joffrey ascends to the throne and has ned executed, initiating a war with the northmen led by rob stark. the story has byzantine political intrigue, weaving together strands from across the 7 kingdoms to create conflict on the front stage. the story has lots of great twists and turns as one side then the other gains ascendancy for a short while before being supplanted. the story deals with the theme of once you become king your idiosyncratic weaknesses unravel you and you fall from power. all of the would be kings fall victim to their follies as their enemies wait for their turn to seize the throne. its truly an epic story in scope and imagination, and does for tv what lotr did for film."
2019-05-21,jmjnjames,Great series. Seasons 1-7 are amazing. Finale Season Very SubPar,8,great show but takes a dive off a cliff in the final season.
2021-01-02,danize,Great! 10/10,8,story is perfect... and the end is perfect.. great!

2012-03-12,aloysiusblue,Do not miss out!,8,"just finished the first season. i'm usually not too interested in fantasy type shows or movies. i was a bit skeptical halfway through the first episode that it might not be for me, but now after i have finished the full season i would have to say that it is by far the greatest television show ever made! across the board from set to performances, from story to production, this here is flawless television good friends! a single hour episode of this show will make any other show aired throughout the entire week look like complete joke... and they are. we desperately need more entertainment of this quality on our tvs!"
2018-07-15,dhmalviya,Season 1,8,"just completed season,1. i know its too late but its amazing. all characters was well played mostly i like snow tyrien and khalees. i will see all the seasons. got"
2011-04-19,azhanei,Well worth the hype,8,"while i'd heard of martin and his work, i came to the series not having read the books. the show so far has lived up to my expectations with a well,assembled cast and the budget to explore the visual depth of a richly-drawn mythos. it is an hbo production and as such nudity and unflinching portrayal of more brutal aspects of their lives was to be expected. people in early history were much more intimately acquainted (no pun intended) with sex, bodily functions and death than many sanitized accounts would lead us to believe, so i find it adds an earthy realness to the story rather than distracting from it as gratuitous. looking forward to the rest of the season!"
2019-04-14,abobakrgamal,It will be great i'm sure,8,it's not gust a series it's a revolution in the world of tv we should support it to have mor of this
2019-05-27,arimaris,Objective,8,all fans sitting back and say: oh what a awful end without taking into consideration that what has made the show all this way fascinating and awesome was being unexpredictable so i can surely say that they have succeeded. to my perspective it was all good enough to satisfy me.
2019-03-24,ahmedx-18225,Infinitely complex masterpiece,8,easy recommend to anyone who wants to watch something he will never forget nor regret

2019-05-20,zaynrichards,BigZ69 doesn't like,8,"this started off as a magnificent show. season 8 has ruined it. i've never seen anything so tragically bad in my life. poor scripting, unconvincing plot, shocking acting and gendry doesn't make it to the throne. i will not recommend. i have ptsd from this show.hbo , remake it now.there are no spoilers in this review because there is nothing to spoil."
2018-08-07,karanjainkj-02237,Favorite TV series,8,"the scenes are portrayed in thes best manner. the performance by the cast is stunning.

2018-08-08,stephanielouisehamilton,Incredible Viewing,8,"this is one series that has only ever grown better with each season that has passed.it's beautiful, it's brutal at times and it's white,knuckle exciting!i cannot wait for the next season, although knowing it will be the final of the series makes it heartbreaking also."
2019-05-16,meemanasser,Amazing,8,"best tv show ever , except season eight it wasn't great ."
2019-04-29,romitk,The best show ever made on the planet,8,"i've watched a lot of movies and tv series. but, got is the best ever so far... way ahead than the 2nd best"
2011-04-27,mike_jones-1,"Having read all the books, I was expecting great things from this series and HBO have done it well.",8,"we should all be thankful that syfy did not attempt this. from the start this was always going to be a very difficult series to move from page to whatever it is that they record films on these days! having watched the first two episodes, it is loyal to the book, no doubt due to george rr martin acting as a consultant. it will be pacey because the books are so vivid and descriptive. those that have not read the books may well wonder what is going on and actually be inspired to read them. a very gritty hbo drama with the usual gratuitous nudity, but hey! thats what we wanted isn't it? the casting of peter dinklage as tyrion lannister is inspired and he plays the part brilliantly. thoroughly enjoyable and i look forward to the next episode."
2019-04-29,krisko-35549,"Simply, the best TV show I have ever watched.",8,"i love the drama and bloodshed throughout the entire series, but also i love the humour. one thing i really enjoy about this movie is that the plot armour is not that strong and you can expect anything to happen. the magic and mystery is tied amazingly with the political disagreements and i have watched every single episode with excitement. to be honest, i was more hyped for season 8 than avengers: endgame!"
2019-05-20,saeeds-74219,The bests show ever made,8,every episode in game of thrones was great before before george r martin left that made the serial orders a setback in his last season but still remains the best.
2019-08-08,npavlicevic-12049,After few months...,8,"i thought about writing the review immediately after i watched the last episode of the show...but i decided to wait for some time, and now i can make the right comment. first of all i'm not the biggest fan, i watched the first episode almost a year ago. in last few months i tried to find some new tv show or a film that is going to be interested for me. i'm going to tell you that i failed. for example, i watched the chernobyl...it's really good, but not even close to the game of thrones. i keep coming to the got all the time beacuse it's the only tv show or film which satisfies me. i could watch if every day. my opinion is that this is the best tv show or film ever filmed, indeed i think that nothing in the future is going to be better than got. on the other hand i can understand why the fans aren't satisfied with the end of it (last season, or maybe two for some people). producers shortened the show and fans were waiting for almost two years to watch the show grand final, but they didn't get what they were expecting to get. after the last episode i was angry also, but i decided to wait...and now i can tell that the got is more than 10/10. i can't understand how someone can rate low this show? what is with you people, did you watch every season, every episode? i don't expect that everybody is going to like the show like i do, but please think about every little thing (actors, costumes, effects, all the people behind the show...) before you rate the show. you people can't give 1/10 just because you didn't like the way it ends...
last thing, i'm living in one of the cities in which the got was filmed so believe me, i know how global and popular the show really is. imagine thousands, maybe milions knowing about your city just beacuse of the game of thrones."

2020-07-09,bradleyf-74436,"10/10 Epic, Better, Greater, and Awesomeness Ten Times More Better Than Star Wars 7,8,9",8,"game of thrones has the perfect ending here why jon snow never wanted the iron throne in the end he wanted to be free at least he got to be king of winter fall but it like fans wanted more but i'm glad he didn't want to sit on a throne and rule westro i'm glad house starks won in the end with the help of house targaryen ending the terror of house lannister's and all the others houses who betrayed them they got what they deserve in the end arya stark is amazing and a awesome character same goes for bran stark, sansa stark, tyrion lannister's, the hound, the wildling leader he was funny as ever and of course dany she was a good guy i never saw her as a bad guy not once if it hadn't been for her and her dragon's and army then house starks wouldn't have defeated the white walkers and the lannister's army and allies i didn't like any of the lannister's beside tyrion, and cersei and jamie other two children's those three were all good but i do like the cast of game of thrones no disrespect to any of them the rest were bad the point is is that show ended the way true blood ended with everyone got what they wanted in the end and fans hated that we'll get over it cause this show to me will always be 10/10 100/100 forever that all folks"

2020-05-24,runeksune,Best fantasy Series ever made,8,"i wasent into fantasy before i started to watch game of thrones, but then i started and after just a det episodes, i found the series so great, that i didnt do nothing but watch game of thrones. all seasons are great, and i have heard that many people thinks that season 8 is a big dissapointment, but i think it was a great ending after all, and sure their was some minor mistakes, but so was there in the previous seasons but no one talks about that. the simple reason why so many hates the last season, is just beacuse the ending didnt satisfy them, but i think the ending was pretty good. is was unpredictible, and it is what got this show so popular in the først place, so dont listen to all those people who looks down on this final season, is is a great show, and it will always be a great show."
2017-08-18,mira-vasileva,I really liked GOT till Season 7,8,"i started watching got after season 3 , i was hooked by daenerys in astapor scene. i became a fan of the series and was thrilled and waiting for season 7.stupid plot, mindless decisions of the main characters, stupidity with capital s. is this the same tyrion we know from the previous seasons, i wondered? daenerys following idiotic plans and advises ...??? even when she was in qarth, she wasn't acting so erratic. huge plot holes - like how fast can a raven fly from north to south? obviously faster than a military jet according to the time line in season 7.season 7 reminds me of guy ricchi's king arthur movie - you can't believe what you are seeing, checking if you are not in some alternate reality.i hope the people writing the got script take some pointers from my review and rethink the future last season."
2019-05-20,kaushalrhcp,Killed the show,8,greatly disappointed in the last two seasons. last season was freaking waste of time.
2019-09-13,mplubinga,Simply the best.,8,"apart from the last season. i have never in my life been so obsessed with a series. it was unpredictable but not ridiculous, it had incredible character depth, and it had five extremely complex but interlinked storylines. credit must be given to the writers, george martin and all the people that made this show happen."
2019-01-12,ianyoung-96428,"Seasons 4,3,6 excellent",8,"game of thrones is currently my favorite tv show. i didn't really care as much for the first season due to the lack of action, but as the series progressed, i could not stop watching. season 2 improved on season 1, but season 3 raised the stakes even higher and gave some of game of thrones most famous best moments in the shows history (red wedding anyone?). but season 4 displayed the show at its best and it's most engaging, with episodes like the lion and the rose, the mountain and the viper and the watchers on the wall, which sadly concluded jon snows and ygrittes story arc. game of thrones just kept on getting better and better until we got season 5. while i do not hate this season, it's nowhere near as good as seasons 3 and 4. the sand snakes and bad dialogue are mostly the main reason why this season falls short compared to the other seasons and the episode unbowed, unbent and unbroken is by far the worst episode in game of thrones history. this season still had many great moments such as the best battle in my opinion in game of thrones history the battle of hardhome. many great battles and visuals overall and i thought it was slightly better than season 1 but still, not nearly as good as season 2, 3 and 4. now we get to season 6. season 6 made up for some of the bad parts of season 5 with a lots of spectacle. we got the battle of the bastards, which is one of the greatest game of thrones battles in history, the death of ramsay bolton, the hodor thing, jon snow's resurrection, the winds of winter episode which is one of the best episodes in game of thrones history and the reveal of jon snow's past. definitely one of the best seasons of game of thrones. then we get to season 7. season 7 was almost comparable to season 5 but i liked this season overall. i loved the battles with euron greyjoy attacking the sand snakes and yara's fleet and most notably the lannisters vs the dothraki and drogon that battle competes with hardhome and the battle of the bastards as one of the best battles in the series history. there were a few missteps in terms of dialogue and how characters were able to travel long distances in short periods of time but overall, this season was pretty good and i can't wait for next season. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy although i don't recommend this show for the faint hearted."

2018-10-06,mathijsleo,Making the Reals great again,8,"not a lot of reviews i have read before commented on this great series, it is by far the most disgusting thing that i have seen... and i like it!
game of thrones have cost a lot of money and the actors are awesome.take for example ygritte, she is portrayed by rose leslie a scottish actress.
she have a beautiful skin and a voice of a tough warrior.
her being there was the first time i loved it.
jon falling in love with her is a story that deserve more air time.
even when she is quiet like and not naked at all there is some kind of magic at work because there is so much spirit.yes there is a lot of sexism in game of thrones and that is probably why this is not g,rated.
giving the ratings not a lot of men and women bordered that at all luckily.
making this not like the lord of the rings or narnia it leaving so much space, it's great.
watching this with your family is not recommended if you have a timid member.
based on the bad reviews sexism is the main reason viewers hate got.
it is also love and lust, having this removed make it almost a fairy tale.
every character needs a backstory and that is just what they focus on.
the pain and suffering daenerys had to go through before she become the dragon queen makes her more admirable for woman who have suffer the same.i hope that season 8 will be with a whole lotta love and fireworks!
good luck to all the actors and thanks for the hard work you guys."
2018-10-07,aryaadnany,not good but great,8,"i think that game of thrones is a show that destroyed a regular process in it's audiences minds. when you think some thing will hapend it wont and exactly something will happend that you never thoght. in adition it will learn people alot of things like to be ""no one"". it goes much higher than people's imagination and wher your mind is too up it will unleash you and you will have a great free fall experiment"
2018-11-26,davidoc-44684,overrated show,8,i finished in episode 3 of season 1 because this show sucks
2019-05-24,sungurlnc,1-7 - Awesome.... 8 - Blah Blah Blah,8,"please understand i'm writing this review less than a week after watching the series finally. i won't give spoilers. i can't stand when people do that. there's always someone that hasn't watched tv/movie. i'm late bloomer to got. i put off watching it, didn't feel like it was my type of show. just watched entire series summer 2018. i was very wrong!!!
i don't really have a type of tv show. i watch downton abbey, supernatural, big bang, all ncis, chick shows, originals before they axed it. when calls the heart, jane the virgin, bbc, peaky blinders.
i go from weepy to shoot em up!
i did not read the books. i feel like hollywood butchers tv/movie when they go from book to screen. they feel they have to change the writers words to get big effects! i can't say if this happened with got. i've only seen book to screen go smoothly twice. after seeing one movie botched so bad i made a rule. read book or watch hollywood version. not both! i think only the author and fans that read the books should speak on that subject.
i enjoyed got seasons 1,7 so much i would watch it again. the cast was my favorite part. it's got to be hard to put together that many people and have such a brilliant cast. they are the reason for the success of this show.
seasons 1-7 you will be on the edge of your seat. each episode ends with a cliffhanger. this is drama and i love old world fighting. the one line zingers from just about every cast member will keep got going on in history for a very long time. the hashtags of all the zingers and lines the characters said will live forever on social media.
it's worth watching!!!!
even if season 8 was rushed by the writers it's still worth watching, if you have watched 1-7.
i'm not going into detail why the writers rushed and didn't answer the many question or give more details. all that information is online.
bottom line 6 episodes wasn't enough!
however, at least there was an ending! i've watched to many tv series that were canceled. the network didn't do a final. i and other fans had to search online: ""is blank show canceled""
so, the millions of fans might not be happy about who is on the throne! at least they know who!
we aren't always promised happy endings.
at least the end happened.
lastly: dragons are freaking awesome!!!!
i had rated this a 10 before season 8. i don't know how ratings are figured. i considered dropping my rating. i don't think that's fair to the cast and crew.
it's always a group like writers that bring another group down.
i feel the writers were selfish and greedy!
i'm only going by the articles and youtube videos i've read and seen. the cast & writer of the books wanted a longer detailed season.
even with the short 6 episode season i don't feel it was written as well compared to the other seasons. basically with out saying spoilers the first 3 episodes were chat sessions for the cast. boring! you had to watch if you were going to finish.
the first 4 episodes were too damned dark!!!
don't watch on an old tv! you want see anything but dark!!! remember it's medieval times! no electricity!
if you haven't watched. give it a chance. you can always stop if you don't like it."
2018-10-09,msnyder-44577,Phenomenal,8,"game of thrones is a phenomenal series that has much to offer. the story is so in depth with a vast background, and characters are highly fleshed out with much to them. every episode keeps me glued to the screen. i love this show so much, and would highly recommend to everyone to at least give it a try."

2019-04-22,mohamedwael-57948,Best series in TV history,8,"show full of heartbreaks, betrayls but there is also have heartwarming relationships. it's unpredictable, which is rarely found in tv shows nowadays. it's not the cliché good guy against the bad guy, but almost every character takes right and wrong actions and faces their consequences; this means that when a 'main' character is surrounded by 20 men who wants to kill him your heart will be racing since almost nobody is immune to death in game of thrones.normally, like any other show, there are some mistakes that could be overlooked thanks to the amazing plot, directing, soundtracks, acting (mostly), etc...one of the very few shows that deserves 10/10"

2018-11-01,admhorner,Insanity,8,"most definitely the best tv series ever created, every single episode is a movie, every character is well invested in by viewers which makes it equally painful when their indefinitely killed.i expect to see jon snow or daenerys targaryen killed by the end of the show which ever survives will claim the iron throne."

2018-11-15,waywardvictorianprincess,I honestly cannot fathom why this show is popular,8,"it's barely recognizable as coming from the source material, and the acting is a grab bag of good or abysmal. so much content, some of it very important, was cut altogether in order to craft a shody and fairly basic narrative.
in spite of the massive budget of seasons 3,7 the show feels cheap."
2019-08-15,sachinthadwijesinghe,Must everyone watch.,8,"epic fantasy tv series ever exists. ending of series (season 8) bit disappointed for some people, but for me it is also epic. there are no any permanent heroes and villains (except night king) throughout the series that's why this series special from others. and also very difficult to predict like other series. i have only one criticism. they should have put all content in season 8 to another two seasons. because season 8 had lots of important incidents which flowed very fast."
2019-02-18,kaiodonnell,The best series ever,8,it just is mate. so many moments of absolute madness that has never before been seen on tv.
2019-05-22,koudou-10351,Losing of time,8,season 8 is so bad! this ending like wtf! why do i watch this serial..also too much betrayal sex sadism rapes violence out of limits! vote down!

2018-12-03,kerridaahmed,Got is the best,8,my best tv serie i like it ... dragons white walkers magic every i just like it bgjgfugdh gzyhxyczt yfhdyfdhjyt jfujfh
2020-04-07,adisharma-07645,Overall a tv series you should watch,8,"got is consider to be one of the best tv series and that is for a reason, first excellent and extraordinary cast, second brilliant story and third for its direction. if we look at the opening seasons the story built by the show is up to the mark which sets the bar, way high and as the shows go on the character build by the writers and screenplay by the directors are good.
for its story hands off to george rr martin.
but in the last season to end the show in limited episodes they screw the story and to create an unexpected ending they deviate the whole story.
at last, i want to tell my best character in got, tyrion lannister(peter dinklage) bcoz of its cunningness, acting and dialogue delivery.
best scene- i demand a trial for combat
tell me yours and why"
2019-05-13,tamimijatovic,WHY GOD WHY?,8,"it's amazing how after 6 breathtaking seasons we get slowly to season 7 and then season 8 that really makes you regret watching anything. i can't understand that someone develops characters for 6,7 seasons and then destroys them completely. so sad..."
2019-05-13,abadi-52977,D&D ruined the show,8,i give them 6 stars because the 6 seasons was so f** great but after that they literally f**ed the show.god help you george martin d&d ruined your series.
2019-05-20,menomalac,Great genre change,8,i really liked the moved wen they changed to comedy for the last season. perfect 5/7
2019-03-05,prmdbrl,A complete show,8,"no words for this show. every thing is so well done and presented. not predictable and the story is amazing plus the actions pack scenes, adventures simply mesmerizing. but it's the last season which feels me hard to believe."
2019-05-14,pufikutya,Still the best,8,still think one of the best series ever! and emilia clarke should win atleast one emmy for the 8th season tobe honest because she gives us so much emotions only with a look.

2018-12-20,nataliafernandezperal,The Best Film I´ve ever seen,8,"this is the best film i´ve ever seen, because it is a very interesting film and it always makes you to be very attentive and to be very concentated in the film to don´t loose a single detail. also they have used many different shots and scenes, with many famous actors and actresses; they have do a lot of effort and also they spend a lot of time doing it."
2019-05-01,muratpapaker,This is sad,8,first four seasons are the best thing ever on tv and since season five it has been going downhill. after they took a year off i thought that the series at least would have a good ending but i'm not so hopeful anymore. but still i thank the producers for meeting me with grrm's awesome books and for making four really unexpectedly good seasons on tv. out of respect for these i give it a 6/10 which was 9/10 in season five. i will wait for winds of winter now.
2019-04-30,rawadrassamny-32592,😍😍,8,this is the best series i have ever watched. and it will stay the best.

2020-05-11,ragbmohmed,The GOAT,8,"the best show you could ever watch, simply because of the way things goes"
2020-05-23,arbab-khan-critic,A Good Show at the Start but Ended in a Cataclysmic Way,8,"i love the way the storyline goes for the show for almost 6 seasons. i love the acting and performance of all the characters in the show, the way the show is produced and staged is just amazing. it surely is a binge,watch. the story is mindblowing until it hits season 7. the first few episodes of season 7 are great but then after that it is just downgraded to its minimum. the ending (season 8) was not good either at all. they took almost 2 years to film and produce season 8 and it was definitely what i wasn't expecting in the end. but still i will always recommend this show to the people as this is still one my favourite shows i have ever watched, not the best show but still it would be in my top five, only because of its storyline. it's really an addicting show."

2019-05-21,rqerolla,Worst ending ever,8,"i saw all the seasons before this season 8, i was very excited by the idea that the last season would have marked game of thrones as the best series of all time, even breaking bad. but it wasn't. extremely ugly, they ruined everything."
2019-04-29,felixthornell,Best tv show!!,8,this tv series is magnificent! i read a book and i must say that a game of thrones is one of the best books i've read. so when i first heard that hbo will do a series on the this book i was thrilled but i was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. but i must say that i was wrong and that the series is better than i thought it would be. much better!
2019-01-14,felixmgk,I Recommend this alot !!!,8,"do not believe any of those negative reviews. i honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. i think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.having said that, this show is stunning. i have never read the books and now i want to. there is so much crap on tv that is renewed year after year (csi, house etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.there is enough brain,dead television. but once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. game of thrones is one such show.it is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. it is worth watching just for the scenery alone.yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.the scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by sean bean perfectly cast as lord edard. although sean bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and lord and soldier. he is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.after watching and sometimes enjoying camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""merlin"" by comparison. and where camelot lacks in depth and scripting, game of thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
2019-05-20,alibazyar,Phenomenon,8,great serial good start beautiful continues a little comedic finish...
2021-07-15,akmallanz,All time fav! but they could have done better for the ending!,8,"it's a great show, after a few years already i've watched this series just today i decide to leave a review. the story is awesome, character development etc is genius, 100% worth watching but seriously we deserve a better ending!as you can see lot of people saying the same thing about season finale how the great adventure story end and yes it's frustrating! but overall it's extraordinary so stop reading the review and start watching now! tbh i miss those early days when i started watch this series :')"

2019-01-25,chriskip94,Seasoson 8 trailer analysis,8,"the last season trailer is trying to deceive us.what i m trying to say,in the wintefell crypts what is comming to snow and aria and sansa is not danger but help. the think that s coming from the krupts is the last line of defence the first men and the children of the forest have put to save westeros in case the white walkers ever came back(maybe just maybe the last line of defence to white walkers is the similar thing but to them,you fight fire with fire, whites with withes)...so wha hbo trying to do is to deceive us."

2019-06-15,hanfuqishe,"Game of the thrones, is very good to end very badly like this",8,"great proletarian thinkers and revolutionaries, the nativity from the storm, the queen of milin, the andal, the queen of the loyna and the ancestors, the rulers of the seven countries and the guardians of the whole world, kali he of the caohai the slave liberator, kao terminator, and the mother of the dragon, danielis, after liberating the reactionary ruled prince junlin, issued a call to the generals who followed her, ""to carry the revolution through to the end"", vowed to liberate all the oppressed in the world.however, some followers quickly completed the transition from the revolutionary to the ruler's identity and psychology after mastering the political power. they have no intention of continuing to follow comrade danielis to complete the great liberation of all mankind. of course, they may never really support the revolution. they just saw that comrade danielis's revolution career was unstoppable and attended it. so when they heard that comrade danielis was about to liberate all the world ,- including their own family territory, the undercurrent began to surge.danielis must die.this is the consensus of the entire vestel feudal lord class.because of the tangerian lineage, jon snow, who is most likely to sit on the iron throne - perhaps we should call him ignam tangerian - was easily provoked by the little devil tyrion. he used comrade danielis to carry out a despicable assassination of his love and trust. comrade danielis took her unfortunate betrayal of her lover and her unwillingness to endure her unfinished business. the fruits of the revolution also fell into the hands of a group of villains.in order to prove the legitimacy of their thief, the arduous battle against the ghosts led by comrade danielis and personally involved in the battle was portrayed as a playful battle. in the story they compiled, aria, the aristocratic princess, completed a decisive blow and took the hero's glory for granted. comrade danielis paid a huge sacrifice in the battle and made a huge contribute, but only matched with the wall of aria's credit book; in the battle of liberation, the stubborn reactionary ruler, queen catherine, chose jade and burned after the city was broken, igniting the pre-buried in the city. the wildfire turned the whole city into ruins-this is completely clear in the green flames that the city has vacated, but it has been demonized by the shackles into comrade danielis's use of the dragon flame to kill the people of junlin.after the fall of the leader, the ambitions immediately launched an intriguing battle of power. the three-eyed crow bran stark, who is not revealing the mountains and not showing his face, always manipulates everything in the dark, and finally reveals his true colors. he became the new king of the six major countries under the unanimous support of everyone, and became the biggest winner; sansha stark became the second biggest winner - she has an independent north. tilly, who changed the historical process by saying only a few words, sought the position of the king's hand, but found himself in the official history of the official song ""song of ice and fire"" never appeared, becoming a non-existent person. in order to prevent aria from telling the truth about the battle of wintertown, alicia, who was portrayed as a superhero, was forced to board the sailboat to the unknown. the savage who participated in the revolution lost everything and was still rushed back to the bitter cold of the north of the great wall. the most shameful traitor of the revolution, jon snow, himself, did not receive any benefit. the new king, stark bran, was still sent back to the great wall of the north, and he continued his vigil to the dead.the leader's most loyal warrior, the gray bug, lost his leader's guidance and became confused. he was disheartened and led the army of the unsullied army to find the hometown of nassan, the revolutionary companion of the sacrificed wife. let us wish him to find nas island, and transformed it into what it used to be like to describe him before life: the sea gently patted the coast, and the dense coconut grove was covered with sunlight. colorful butterflies dance around the flowers, and happy people sing in joy.great proletarian thinkers and revolutionaries, the inhumanizers of the storm, the queen of milin, the andal, the queen of the loyna and the ancestors, the rulers of the seven countries and the guardians of the whole world, kali he of the caohai , slave liberator, kao terminator, the savior of 996.icu, the mother of the dragon, comrade danielis, is immortal!may her spirit of heaven be able to guide the oppressed in the world forever!"
